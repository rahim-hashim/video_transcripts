# Former CIA Officer Amaryllis Fox Kennedy Iraq, JFK, & Everything Else Our Intel Agencies Lie About
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4)
*  So this is a tweet from me. I don't normally read people's tweets, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=0.0s)]
*  in standing with Ukraine, the Biden-Harris administration convinced them, Ukraine, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  to abandon a peace deal that would have ceded only half of the territory that Russia now occupies. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=7.92s)]
*  And for that opportunity to lose twice as much of their homeland, they paid with tens of thousands [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=12.8s)]
*  of innocent lives. We did this to control the 11 trillion of minerals under the Donbass. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=16.96s)]
*  We did it to grind down the Russian war machine on the grist of Ukrainian teenagers. We did it [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  to hand out hundreds of billions of dollars to US hedge funds who are, as we speak, carving up [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=26.96s)]
*  rights to Ukraine's fertile soil and vast mineral resources. The truth is the United States has [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=31.92s)]
*  never stood with the people of Ukraine. That is simply a jingle, an ad campaign broadcast to those [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=36.4s)]
*  who have never been there, designed to sell taxpayers on the appeal of prolonging war for [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  profit. We have cost Ukraine her territory. We have cost Ukraine her children. The Warhawks [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=45.92s)]
*  and the bankers are no friends to Ukraine. Whoa. I was applauding as I read that. Alone in my truck. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=51.2s)]
*  I mean, it's a horror. It's a horror. And we are, we just allocated another hundred billion. I mean, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=58.88s)]
*  and where is the end game? How did you get here? How did you get, I mean, you're, we're from, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=86.48s)]
*  you know, the same city basically, and you were a CI officer. And you're just from a world in which [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=94.48s)]
*  that is an extremely unpopular, never uttered sentiment. How did you get to that? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=101.84s)]
*  Well, part of it is pattern recognition, right? I mean, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=107.28s)]
*  yeah, we have done this before. And, you know, it's just how many times can you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=111.12s)]
*  wade through years and years of a war with absolutely no stated end game and dwindling [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  public support and mounting civilian casualties and disintegrating homeland because all of your [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=128.88s)]
*  money is being spent, you know, fueling weaponry to blow up over foreign skies and continue to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=136.4s)]
*  print more money to pay for it. And the answer the last time around was 20 years. And I want to make [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  sure it's not again, because, you know, here we are at $33 trillion worth of debt. And we're [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=156.0s)]
*  now paying more on those interest payments every year than we are on defense, completely unsustainable. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=166.32s)]
*  And most importantly are the human lives. Yes. Tens of thousands of people who won't, you know, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=174.88s)]
*  proverbially dance at their children's wedding. That's right. And see the sunrise and drink a cup [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=181.68s)]
*  of coffee. And it's just that part of it is completely lost. And when you, when you hear [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=186.24s)]
*  our generals and our political leaders saying, don't you understand this is a great thing? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=191.44s)]
*  We are achieving the strategic aim of diminishing Russian military reserves. And we don't even have [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=198.72s)]
*  to put a person on the ground. You know, what they are saying is that those Ukrainian children [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  and now, you know, old men and anyone else that they can put up against the front line are lesser [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=211.44s)]
*  children of God than our own that we would send over there. And, you know, that doesn't fly with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=219.2s)]
*  me. So it's repugnant. Yeah. And I know you don't want to talk about yourself, but I'm because I do, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=227.04s)]
*  I think I understand your background pretty well. I just I'm fascinated by the fact that you are [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  saying this, and that no one very few people in the world from which honestly, we both come, are [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=238.72s)]
*  saying anything like this. And so what, how did, how did you reach this conclusion? Of course, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=247.52s)]
*  it's pattern recognition. You're saying it's common sense. How could you not reach this conclusion? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=253.2s)]
*  I agree with you. But how is it that almost no one else in Washington is saying anything like this? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=256.64s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I wish they would. And I think some of them are saying it, you know, in the privacy of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=262.8s)]
*  their own conversations. But I came to it, you know, after 9-11, there was kind of a suspension [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=267.6s)]
*  of opposition to war in our country that, you know, maybe has has never let up. I mean, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=279.6s)]
*  there's some recognition now that, that poor choices were made there. But in the moment when, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=286.32000000000005s)]
*  you know, France was objecting, and we decided to call French fries, freedom fries, and you know, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  that there was a real hunger for war. And I remember gleefully participating in that, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=296.48s)]
*  to my shame. Yes. It was a collective psychosis, maybe a grieving process or, you know, and for me, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=303.68s)]
*  I'd just 9-11 happened as I was going into my last year at university. And I went to Oxford overseas, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=312.8s)]
*  and it started in October. So I was home for it. My mom lived in DC at the time. And I had a whole [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=322.8s)]
*  plan. I was going to go to Thailand after graduation and do human rights journalism. And I sort of had [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=330.72s)]
*  a background there and on the Tiber news border before school. And everything changed as it did [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=336.72s)]
*  for so many in our generation, I think, on September 11. And for me, I had lost one of my [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=346.4s)]
*  best friends in third grade on the flight that blew up over Lockabee, Scotland. And it brought [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=352.64s)]
*  a lot of that back. And I think hearing the war drums beating, for me, I hadn't oddly enough heard [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=360.32s)]
*  much about the intelligence world. I mean, I didn't know many of the things that I know now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=370.08s)]
*  I don't think I probably would have gone into it if I had. But I liked the idea of a kind of a [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=375.6s)]
*  secret diplomatic service. I liked the idea that rather than conduct an incredibly expensive [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=380.8s)]
*  kinetic war, expensive both in terms of lives and treasure, that you could find out about something [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=388.32000000000005s)]
*  before it happened and prevent the attack from happening in the first place, which admittedly [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=397.36s)]
*  was a kind of naive early 20s understanding of the intelligence business. But at its best, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=403.76s)]
*  you know, that is what it does or what it intends to do. I think where they get into tremendous [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=409.76s)]
*  trouble is I'm tempted to say mission creep, but actually it was kind of built in to the entire [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  OSSCA history. But is when rather than going in and actually reporting what is happening in every [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=425.44s)]
*  corner of the world, they are making it happen. Yes. So it's not really intelligence gathering. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=432.0s)]
*  It's a kind of secret military. Right. I mean, rather than reporting that a coup is about to [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=443.12s)]
*  take place, you know, for absolute sure it's about to take place. Right. And that has not worked out [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=448.88s)]
*  in 100% of cases, as far as I can tell. And yet again, we never learn our lesson. I mean, you look [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=457.2s)]
*  at what's happening in the Middle East now, you know, what 70 years on post-Mosaddegh and [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=464.08s)]
*  oh, if only we had a democratically elected leader in Iran. We did. You know, and people may or may [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  not agree with each of these governments, but they are for the people of each country to work [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=481.84s)]
*  through. We had our own revolution in this country. It was a very important, you know, stealing of our [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=488.32s)]
*  national values. And I think you have to go through that yourself. And I worry in Iran that we're, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=497.2s)]
*  you know, hearing the beginnings of that again with this kind of royalist sentiment, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=504.56s)]
*  monarchist sentiment of, you know, well, the human rights abuses there are so egregious that anything [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=514.32s)]
*  would be justified. And it just, it does no one any favors. So, I mean, what you're describing is [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=521.84s)]
*  conceptual corruption, like a corruption of first principles. If the point of your foreign policy [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=528.4000000000001s)]
*  is to spread democracy, you can't end democracy in the name of democracy. I mean, you just, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=534.48s)]
*  that's insane. And no one says that. Yeah. Unless you're the Democratic party in the United States [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=538.8000000000001s)]
*  these days who seem to be, you know, have cut their teeth on ending democracy to save it overseas, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=544.1600000000001s)]
*  and now are practicing the same theory here in the United States where they've told us for the last [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=551.6800000000001s)]
*  two years, you know, Donald Trump is such a threat to democracy that we must stage a palace coup, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=557.36s)]
*  you know, replace our candidate with someone who hasn't received a single vote, undermine [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=565.28s)]
*  every other candidate of our own party and every other party in the courts, censor American citizens, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=572.64s)]
*  undermine the constitution, all in order to save democracy. So, I think what we reap overseas, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=579.92s)]
*  what we sow overseas, we reap at home, and we're in the midst of that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=587.68s)]
*  It does seem like our foreign policy drives our domestic policy or that there isn't actually much [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=591.12s)]
*  of a domestic policy. There's not a great concern about what happens in the United States. In [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=596.08s)]
*  Washington, I have noticed, I came to this over 40 years of watching, but that maybe was inevitable. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=600.16s)]
*  If you start overthrowing democratically elected governments abroad, why wouldn't over time you [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=607.04s)]
*  think that's acceptable in your own country? Acceptable, maybe even noble. I mean, you know, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=611.44s)]
*  the lies people tell themselves in order to persist with what is ultimately an incredibly [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=615.92s)]
*  profitable business model. But also, you know, if your end is stability and you tell yourself that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=623.28s)]
*  stability requires control, you know, and that there need to be small short term sacrifices, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=632.3199999999999s)]
*  and I think we really are seeing that bear out in our domestic politics, where increasingly [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=638.4799999999999s)]
*  I'm seeing the First Amendment is an obstacle. Does the Constitution, you know, actually serve [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=645.84s)]
*  us these kinds of questions and articles coming out in the media and democratic leaders? And I [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=652.8000000000001s)]
*  think it really is a symptom of what we have been spreading around the world. And the results are [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=658.72s)]
*  plain to see, you know, I mean, we had more Americans slip into poverty over the last two [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=664.96s)]
*  years than any year in the last 50. Our nuclear clock, you know, we've ticked closer to midnight [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=669.92s)]
*  than at any time since its creation in 1947. More people died around the world in the first [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=679.5999999999999s)]
*  two years of Biden-Harris from war and violence than in all four years of Donald Trump. I think [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=688.8s)]
*  people don't really recognize, and not even just because of Ukraine, even if you take Ukraine out [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=693.68s)]
*  of it. And so I think that, you know, the insecurity that we see there, and then the fact that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=699.28s)]
*  at home we have more children living in poverty than any rich nation except for Romania, our life [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=706.9599999999999s)]
*  expectancy sits right above Algeria's. You know, in the 1990s, if you were born in the United States, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=713.12s)]
*  you could expect to live as long as in any other pure nation, and now you die six years earlier. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=719.6s)]
*  You know, six years of hanging out with your grandchildren and watching the sunrise on your [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=726.88s)]
*  porch has just been robbed through absolute utter lack of leadership on domestic health priorities. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's really time for a shakeup. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=743.28s)]
*  Everything you said is so nicely put and true. I wonder, because you know a lot of the people [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=747.04s)]
*  operating our current foreign policy, and you worked at one of the agencies prosecuting that [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=760.48s)]
*  foreign policy, like, did you detect these attitudes when you worked there? When you worked at CIA, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=765.1999999999999s)]
*  did you get the sense that people felt it would be okay to interfere in domestic politics in the U.S.? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=769.52s)]
*  Well, they were sure keen on doing it in other countries [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=777.04s)]
*  and used a lot of the same tactics. I never witnessed any tendency to do it in the U.S. at all, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=784.0s)]
*  but it also, you know, I was working very specifically around, I worked UK liaison and then [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=792.64s)]
*  worked operationally on non-proliferation, but specifically within the context of non-state [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  actors. So very focused overseas, watched the exact same playbook of going in, finding underfunded [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=810.32s)]
*  newspapers and radio stations and TV shows. You know, a benefactor would arrive with funding. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=821.6s)]
*  And all of a sudden, you know, that mouthpiece is presenting stories in a light that, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=830.64s)]
*  you know, aligns with U.S. foreign policy or the preferences of whatever leader is in power here. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=837.5200000000001s)]
*  And I think that we are seeing that across the board in media, except for new media like this, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=845.0400000000001s)]
*  and that's been a godsend to our domestic politics. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=851.5200000000001s)]
*  Do you think that we're seeing federal agencies, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=855.12s)]
*  intelligence agencies influencing American media surreptitiously? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=857.92s)]
*  Absolutely. I don't think that it's in as, I mean, I doubt they're actually investors. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=863.36s)]
*  There are layers of this, right? I mean, you see at the most basic level, it's, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=871.52s)]
*  you run the story for me and I'll give you the best tip the next time that I have a leak, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=877.04s)]
*  right? Which is the oldest exchange in the world. Well, maybe the second oldest. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=881.68s)]
*  And it goes on, you know, every day. But there's no doubt that there are also [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=886.7199999999999s)]
*  actual formal sources throughout the media and always have been, you know. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=897.76s)]
*  What does that mean, a formal source in the media? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=902.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, an asset, somebody that would be paid by intelligence organizations to work on [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=904.4s)]
*  their behalf, play stories on their behalf. And of course that happens, you know, all across the world. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=913.76s)]
*  But when it happens in the United States, then it's the end of democracy, of course. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=920.88s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, we have SESA operating basically a JIRA ticketing system [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=925.6s)]
*  for any tweet that the White House chooses to, that they would like to see deleted, even if it's [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=932.24s)]
*  ingest, even if it's satire, they just put it in the ticketing session. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=939.04s)]
*  Can you explain what SESA is? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=942.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, what's interesting about SESA is that, you know, it's a part of the Department [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=944.32s)]
*  of Homeland Security, but it's supposed to protect our nation's infrastructure from terror attacks. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=951.04s)]
*  And at the beginning of the Biden administration, a decision was made that information is [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=958.96s)]
*  infrastructure. Oh, it is now, is it? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=965.36s)]
*  Which has, you know, an Orwellian tang to it. And as a result, in order to secure it, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=969.2s)]
*  you know, SESA was quietly empowered with the ability, sometimes directly and sometimes through [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=978.0s)]
*  NGO cutouts, to present to all the social media companies and Wikipedia and Amazon [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=986.16s)]
*  any content that was flagged as concerning. And they, you know, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=997.52s)]
*  BOLO alerts went out beyond the lookout. And they held weekly meetings and said, you know, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1000.64s)]
*  here put an enormous amount of financial pressure on these companies saying, you know, that their [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1010.64s)]
*  legal protections from liability would be withdrawn if they didn't cooperate, naming and shaming them [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1017.76s)]
*  if they took, you know, longer than a week to respond on something from the podium in the White [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1024.8s)]
*  House. And Mark Zuckerberg has, you know, spoken publicly and written about the degree of pressure [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1030.0s)]
*  that he felt to censor American people. And we're now seeing UK's Labour Party doing the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1038.56s)]
*  exact same thing here in our own country, which is, you know, in some ways more egregious and [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  in other ways, you know, what do you mean? So UK, the Labour Party, which is currently in [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1053.2s)]
*  power in the UK, has a series of NGOs that it funds and directs that have waged war on free speech, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1059.36s)]
*  especially what they call Twitter under Musk or Musk's Twitter, that they have gone into multiple [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1071.6799999999998s)]
*  offices, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, and said, you know, that they want to participate in and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1081.36s)]
*  provide support for destroying Musk's Twitter. And, you know, this is- [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1090.56s)]
*  Peter T. Ries Wait, they would be the dreaded foreign actor interfering in our democracy, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1097.12s)]
*  correct? We're always hearing so much about it. Turns out to be the Brits. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1101.84s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar Turns out to be the Brits. You know, and many others, right? But there is, nobody's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1105.2s)]
*  fighting them because Labour has just sent, you know, I think 30 people over to campaign for [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1110.96s)]
*  Kamala Harris. Peter T. Ries Is that legal? That seems like foreign interference in our- [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1115.9199999999998s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar Evidently, their approach is that as long as you're not donating money, if you're out on [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1118.8799999999999s)]
*  the campaign trail volunteering, that it's legal. But, you know, certainly unwise, in my opinion, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1124.56s)]
*  because, you know, if President Trump wins this election, which he's looking very likely to do [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1132.56s)]
*  right now, you know, it's an improper way to conduct foreign relations, right? You don't go [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1139.84s)]
*  to another country and campaign for a particular candidate for office. Peter T. Ries Yeah, or try [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1146.72s)]
*  and shut down their most basic rights. Amy Klobuchar I mean, the First Amendment, as everybody [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1150.56s)]
*  always says, it's first for a reason. The Constitution, you know, was written a decade later, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1157.04s)]
*  but largely in response to our secession from Great Britain to come and to meddle with that Constitution [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1164.32s)]
*  in our own country. And of course, this follows suit with some of the challenges that we're seeing [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1172.0s)]
*  free speech face in the United Kingdom, where people are being thrown in prison for 10 months, [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1179.36s)]
*  for two years, and so forth for social media posts. Peter T. Ries For talking. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1185.04s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar Yeah. Peter T. Ries You're half English, you're educated heavily in England. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1189.28s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar I love England. And by the way, that does not reflect England or Great Britain. It is a [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1193.12s)]
*  very small group of leaders there who have aligned themselves with a very small group of leaders here, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  in the same way that censorship and undermining the Constitution does not reflect the American [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1208.0s)]
*  people and yet our leaders persist in doing it. So. Peter T. Ries Are you surprised as you look [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1213.36s)]
*  across and see what's happening there? Amy Klobuchar I am. I mean, I have a law degree [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1218.56s)]
*  from Oxford on, you know, in English law. And it was always clear that, you know, it's not a written [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  Constitution. It's much more based in precedent, but that there is a deep and abiding respect [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1231.6s)]
*  going back to the Magna Carta for civil liberties. And the idea that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1237.36s)]
*  a flood of immigration, which, you know, we must take a measure of accountability for, because [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1247.1999999999998s)]
*  largely our going into Iraq was what began that entire shift in the demographics of Europe, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1252.7199999999998s)]
*  would have such an impact. Peter T. Ries It's fall in the northeast, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1262.0s)]
*  and that means grouse season. I got up at 5 a.m. yesterday to take my dogs out to hunt for some rough [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1265.36s)]
*  grouse. And before I left, I went to my safe to pull out my grandmother's 28 gauge. Yes, my [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1270.6399999999999s)]
*  grandmother was a bird hunter. Where do I keep that treasured possession? I keep it in a Liberty [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1278.4799999999998s)]
*  safe. For over 35 years, hunters have trusted Liberty safes to keep their firearms safe and [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1284.56s)]
*  secure. And we do to this day in my house. Liberty safes are made by American craftsmen [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1291.04s)]
*  right here in the United States. It's a product we believe in. It is a product you use to hide [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1296.72s)]
*  and protect the things you care about most, the things you would least like to see stolen. So it's [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1302.48s)]
*  a special deal for all of you who hunt out there. Liberty is offering an exclusive promotion for our [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1308.56s)]
*  viewers for the month of October. Go to Liberty safe dot com slash Tucker and place one of their [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1313.92s)]
*  best selling safes in your cart. Use the promo code Tucker at checkout for a great discount. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1320.08s)]

*  We can just ask you to pause. Are going into Iraq is what set off the demographic shift in Europe? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1340.0s)]
*  Yeah, I that's of course true beyond debate, but I think it's under appreciated. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1345.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, we broke the world for I used to say we broke the world for 20 years, but here we are. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1350.08s)]
*  And I think, you know, the ramifications were continuing to deal with and they, you know, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1354.72s)]
*  they compound because as a result of that, you know, we have Brexit, we have [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1362.24s)]
*  many of the pressures that have led to the Ukraine war. And as a result of that, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1375.28s)]
*  we're facing, I think really unprecedented dangers in this country that are also greatly [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1384.8000000000002s)]
*  under appreciated. And we will respond to if they happen. And I think that escalatory cycle is what [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1392.24s)]
*  keeps us trapped in the bad decision making. And, you know, I remember at the time in Iraq, it was, [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1402.4s)]
*  you know, six months, we'll be out, they'll greet us as heroes. And the same thing was [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1411.28s)]
*  said in Ukraine. And we find ourselves in these quagmires without realizing that, yes, there's a [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1416.8799999999999s)]
*  body count. And by the way, that is generally largely lied about and hidden. Oh, for sure. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1422.56s)]
*  But then there's this vastly higher body count of those whose lives have been uprooted, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1427.2s)]
*  and who have either died early as a result of, you know, migration or deaths of despair. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1435.68s)]
*  This is the same with lockdowns. And those numbers are incredibly hard to ever even peg down. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1442.24s)]
*  And when you look at the millions and millions displaced, I mean, Brown University pegs the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1450.64s)]
*  global war on terrorism as having killed or led to the deaths of 800,000 civilians. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1456.72s)]
*  And that goes so far beyond what the US will speak to. And then those that were forced to [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1465.2s)]
*  migrate are in the many millions. And when you take homogenous, you know, Europe is balkanized, [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1473.76s)]
*  but each element there is accustomed to being very homogenous. And those are the indigenous [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1482.32s)]
*  populations of the continent. Right. And when I was in, when I was at Georgetown, [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1488.8s)]
*  I did my master's at the School of Foreign Service there. And the focus of my thesis was trying to [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  get very quantitative about predicting terrorism, because at the time it was [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1505.28s)]
*  a very squishy subject. It was post 9-11, and it was mostly qualitative the way people were describing [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1509.84s)]
*  it. And one of the closest corollaries that I could find to being predictive was the ratio [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1515.84s)]
*  between hookah bars and madrasas, but not just the ratio, the rate at which it changed. And that [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1527.76s)]
*  is, I think, deeply underappreciated. It's not that they don't necessarily plan to at some point [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1537.04s)]
*  have their demographics look different, but when it's forced so quickly that nobody can absorb- [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1543.92s)]
*  The pace of change matters. It matters. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1550.4s)]
*  We can't metabolize it. People are not designed for this pace of change at all. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1552.8000000000002s)]
*  It really, really matters. Whatever, you know, that's it, madrasa bars and hookah bars are [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1557.8400000000001s)]
*  in the Middle Eastern context. But when you look at what we're experiencing in the US, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1565.68s)]
*  where you have kids who've just come back from a pandemic then being sent home again to do Zoom [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1572.64s)]

*  same purpose while veterans sleep under bridges on the streets. The scale of it and the deluge [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1586.0s)]
*  is what makes it impossible for any society to absorb. And that doesn't make it racist, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1597.2s)]
*  it doesn't make it wrong. It's human nature to need time and the nature of economies and societies [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1604.8s)]
*  to need time to be able to expand and adapt. And I think our going into Iraq, Afghanistan a little [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1612.72s)]
*  bit though in the early days that was actually pretty well managed before it sprawled. But 2003, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1623.28s)]
*  I think was really the beginning of this era where we were shifting, you know, we're talking [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1630.72s)]
*  about a rules-based order and breaking every single rule in that rules-based order and then [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1638.32s)]
*  having utter disregard for the social chaos that was resulting. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1645.52s)]
*  Exactly, exactly, exactly. And people's need which is inherent for order and predictability [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1649.52s)]
*  and continuity in their lives and their communities. We always talk about communities, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1657.76s)]
*  nobody actually cares about communities, they'll blow them up in a heartbeat. So can I just ask you, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1661.36s)]
*  there's so many threads, but just to get back to what drew you into this kind of amazing life that [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1665.68s)]
*  you've lived, which was 9-11. I don't understand, I sincerely don't understand, maybe you do, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1672.24s)]
*  why 23 years later when every regime in place in 2001 is now different, including the Saudi [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1680.08s)]
*  government, why we would have so many classified documents from that time? What's the excuse for [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1686.88s)]
*  that? I don't get that at all. I mean, why do we still have classified documents from the 60s? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1693.76s)]
*  Oh, I completely agree. But because 9-11 was, you know, was the world-changing event of our [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1698.72s)]
*  lifetimes, I think it's fair to say in retrospect, I don't understand the justification for that. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1705.04s)]
*  And I don't know why nobody demands like, why not declassify it? Like, why shouldn't it's our country? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1709.68s)]
*  All these people died, we should know. Right. And I agree entirely. And I agree. I mean, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1714.88s)]
*  the same applies for the 60s. I think ultimately, you know, when most Americans go to work for a [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1721.52s)]
*  third of their working week, they are working for the government. They are working, they are taking [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1729.28s)]
*  that money, having spent the day away from their family, sacrificing whatever they would prefer to [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1733.68s)]
*  be doing, and they don't get to keep any of it. They turn it all over to the government. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1738.8799999999999s)]
*  The government works for the people, directly. I mean, they are directly paid by the people. And [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1743.84s)]
*  if your boss asks what you've been doing, and you say, sorry, I can't tell you it's classified, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1750.16s)]
*  it doesn't cut it. And are there moments where the actual identity of a source who's [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1758.5600000000002s)]
*  preventing nuclear war with the Russians is at stake? Sure. But they're actually quite few and [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1767.68s)]
*  far between. And I think there is a bureaucratic inertia here. Some of it is CYA and some of it is [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1773.44s)]
*  probably more nefarious than that. But there is also a lot of bureaucratic inertia. It's one of [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1784.16s)]
*  the reasons I'm excited about the prospect of Elon getting in there, but to do some surgery on [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1788.8s)]
*  some of that bureaucracy. But, you know, CIA 101, when you start, you have this one week, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1794.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, fill out your tax forms, get the same as you would with any other job, like nothing sexy [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1800.72s)]
*  about it at all. There's just here's the insurance program and the person who's going to work in, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1807.76s)]
*  you know, the coffee shop is sitting next to someone who's about to go down to the farm. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1812.64s)]
*  It's just everybody goes through it. And the email client that you use looks a lot like Gmail. I [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1816.96s)]
*  mean, it's provided by Google, and it has all the normal fields and then an additional field [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1823.6s)]
*  that's for classification. And it's a drop down menu. And when it first drops down, it's all [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1830.0800000000002s)]
*  check boxes with their own subsets. And it's hundreds of different classifications, all different [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1839.44s)]
*  numbers and codes. And you can hover over them and they say when to use them. But there are a lot. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1846.0s)]
*  And we were told in that first day, you know, in that first course, you know, just to make it [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1854.48s)]
*  easy on yourself, pick HCS 404, checkbox it, hit save as favorites, it'll come up every time, [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1863.76s)]
*  and then you don't have to worry about it. Well, that's, you know, human compartment and sensitive [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1871.6s)]
*  information. It's usually reserved for, you know, the actual identity, address or identifying details [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1876.0s)]
*  of a source that whose life could be in danger for what they're doing. And yet here it's being [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1883.12s)]
*  used for, you know, I'll meet you at 430 at Dunkin Donuts and everything in between, good and bad, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1889.36s)]
*  nefarious and not. And the problem with that is that it is completely exempt from any [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1899.04s)]
*  declassification threshold ever. And as a result of this kind of administrative tweak, which is [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1904.3999999999999s)]
*  either just to save people time or maybe to, you know, reduce the number of things that will ever [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1911.12s)]
*  eventually be published. Now you have class after class after class of CIA officers that, you know, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1918.08s)]
*  just chronically make sure that every single email they ever write will never see the light of day. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1925.52s)]
*  And I think that is being done across government. So literally, the default is secrecy from the [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1930.32s)]
*  public. Yep. The default is you will never know. You never know how much money was spent, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1938.24s)]
*  what it was spent on, whether it was legal, you know, whether you spent that Tuesday away from [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1947.6s)]
*  your family working to pay taxes and those taxes went to kill someone or went to save someone's [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1954.32s)]
*  life. There's no accountability. And there's no way to know. And there's no way to know. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1960.0s)]
*  And there could be, right? I have a lot of respect for the role of intelligence agencies [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1965.44s)]
*  in saving lives and in preventing conflict and attacks. I think they're actually far more [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1976.0800000000002s)]
*  valuable in that than many people realize because they have so sullied their name by getting into [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1983.76s)]
*  all kinds of other business that they shouldn't be doing. But there is a very valuable role for [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1990.64s)]
*  them. And in that, there are some things that do need to remain secret, but 20 years later, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=1996.3200000000002s)]
*  40 years later, 60 years later, then it becomes about quote unquote preserving trust in our [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2005.0400000000002s)]
*  institutions. Right? Continuing to lie to you. Code for if you knew what we did then, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2012.8000000000002s)]
*  you would shut us down now. I assume that's the motive behind continuing to classify documents [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2020.64s)]
*  from 1963. And the Kennedy is well, it's sure not sources and methods, right? I mean, if it is, then [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2028.48s)]
*  you know, we've got, we need to update our sources and methods, but it's not. I mean, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2035.2s)]
*  I mean, from time to time, they will say this is about protecting allies. Of course, I think we [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2042.32s)]
*  would all want to know if there were allies or any other nation states involved in what happened in [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2050.96s)]
*  the sixties or what happened in 9 11. So protecting anyone above the American people who you work for [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2057.68s)]
*  doesn't really make a lot of sense. They'll actually say it's to protect allies. Well, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2065.6s)]
*  not about a specific operation, but as a reason for long-term classification when pushed. Yeah. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2070.16s)]
*  That's pretty outrageous that they would admit that. I mean, so in terms of a foreign country [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2079.12s)]
*  or more important in the interest of the American people. I think they're, I think their kind of [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2083.92s)]
*  argument would be if I were to steal a man it eventually the American people will be protected [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2088.24s)]
*  by something that we need from that ally, some kind of security collaboration or whatever we [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2095.12s)]
*  might need down the road. And therefore, you know, we must keep that relationship strong. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2101.68s)]
*  And again, if it is the identity of somebody who's working with you, whose family is going [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2108.96s)]
*  to be in danger, that is absolutely true. And maybe that's still true 40 years later. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, it's possible that it is in certain circumstances, but. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2118.56s)]
*  How about 61 years later? Yeah, I mean, less and less likely. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2123.2799999999997s)]
*  What do you think that's about? The assassinations of the 60s? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2128.7999999999997s)]
*  Yes. Oh, I could talk to you about that all day. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2133.92s)]
*  I bet. You've intersected with it on various levels. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2137.12s)]
*  I have. Yeah. And I feel something of a responsibility to get to the bottom of that, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2141.12s)]
*  at least in my lifetime for my children. You know, I mean, my daughter Bobcat is Bobby the fourth. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2150.64s)]
*  So her great grandfather was RFK. And I want to be able to look at her and [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2158.0s)]
*  for her to know whether or not her own government was involved in these assassinations. And if so, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  what's been done about it to make sure that that never ever happens again, that there's never a coup [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2175.44s)]
*  like that in this country again. And I think when you look at the collaboration that was going on [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2180.4s)]
*  in those days between the intelligence community and organized crime and the mob, you know, there [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2187.68s)]
*  were very blurry boundaries. And I worry that today the cartels have kind of taken the mob's role [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2196.7200000000003s)]
*  in that world. The cartel, meaning the Latin American drug cartels? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2210.4s)]
*  Do you think that the US government is working with the cartels? [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2216.0s)]
*  I mean, working with is broad, right? I mean, the intelligence community's job is to [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2220.32s)]
*  protect the American people. And sometimes they interpret that as requiring [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2227.68s)]
*  collaboration with criminal elements, with terror organizations, ostensibly as part of cover to, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2233.12s)]
*  as part of cover to, you know, to complete an operation that will save American lives or [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2241.04s)]
*  provide information that, you know, would be helpful to American leaders. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2250.16s)]
*  Clearly in the 60s, that ended up being [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2257.2799999999997s)]
*  manipulated into a broader collaboration that allowed [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2261.52s)]
*  US government elements to undertake activities that they could not directly undertake by law. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2268.4s)]
*  And, you know, I think we've seen that even with liaison partnerships. You know, it's clear that [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2277.44s)]
*  five eyes has been used, you know, liaison intelligence liaison partners have been used to [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2286.08s)]
*  surveil leaders in our own government when our intelligence agencies could not do it directly [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2294.2400000000002s)]
*  because there's no prohibition on sharing intelligence. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2299.04s)]
*  Right. So you get a foreign intel service to do the work for you and then you get the information. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2302.64s)]
*  Right. And similarly, you get an NGO or a contractor to do the work for you. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2307.2000000000003s)]
*  Right. And similarly, you get an NGO or a contractor to censor the American people or you get [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2312.48s)]
*  a criminal organization to undertake a criminal act that, you know, you might not be so savory [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2321.92s)]
*  for your own officers to do. And that, you know, I never worked in Latin America, so it's not [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2331.92s)]
*  it's not something that I have directly witnessed, but I certainly have direct, you know, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2337.44s)]
*  knowledge of it happening. Of the US government collaborating or having some relationship that's [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2346.4s)]
*  not purely antagonistic with the Mexican and or other drug cartels. Sure. And I think, you know, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2352.16s)]
*  again, the steel man would be this is for the benefit of the American people. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2362.0s)]
*  That's always for your own good for sure. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2366.8s)]
*  Look, is there an argument for having penetrations in the top of the cartels in the same way that [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2369.36s)]
*  you do at the top of, you know, the Iranian or Russian or any other adversarial government? [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2374.5600000000004s)]
*  Sure. These I mean, many of them are as powerful and threatening as a nation state. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2379.76s)]
*  The problem, though, is money. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2390.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2392.5600000000004s)]
*  And there's just so much money spinning off of these enterprises, these the cartels that, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2393.36s)]
*  I mean, you could just see corruption happening very easily. And I know one person who was [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2399.76s)]
*  involved in that who, who I trust, I can't prove it, but who worked for CIA as a contractor moving [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2404.96s)]
*  over as so many do from the military. And, you know, he's told me a great length about the money [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2412.4s)]
*  that CIA was getting from drug cartels in Latin America and South America, in his case. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2419.6s)]
*  I can't prove that, but I was shocked to hear that. You don't seem shocked to hear that. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2425.92s)]
*  So I mean, look at Iran-Contra, you know, I mean, look at Air America in Vietnam, like these are, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2430.64s)]
*  it's not, this is not a new pattern for intelligence. And when you look at black [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2435.52s)]
*  budgets, you know, I mean, Congress was stunned that there were operations happening in Niger and [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2440.96s)]
*  obviously they control the purse strings. So who's funding that? Right. And so that pattern has gone [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2449.8399999999997s)]
*  back a long way where, where the narcotics trade has, has funded off book activities or that, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2456.08s)]
*  you know, that is obviously what happened with the Contras and has, has happened before and since. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2469.36s)]
*  Given how many Americans are dying or whose lives are being destroyed, families wrecked entire parts [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2478.56s)]
*  of the country, just devastated by drugs. It's, it's a little much. I mean, that's like kind of [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2484.16s)]
*  at this point, like Nazi collaboration level immoral, I would say. No. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  It is. It's pouring over the border. And along with it, you know, humans and children and [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2497.6s)]
*  I think we really are seeing the devastation that that reaps. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2508.56s)]
*  As you say, I mean, that just the sheer scale and the sum of the revenue involved makes it [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2518.0s)]
*  a real challenge. So we're getting pretty close to the presidential election. That probably has [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2526.56s)]
*  you thinking about the future and possibly feeling a little anxious about it. So what can you do [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2530.24s)]
*  to secure your future? Well, probably a lot of things, but maybe one of the first, and this is [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2537.52s)]
*  not glamorous, but get some life insurance. According to the annual insurance barometer study, 41% of [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2544.48s)]
*  people don't have the coverage they need should something unexpected happen to them and unexpected [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2551.52s)]
*  things happen. In fact, it's going to happen to all of us not to be morbid. You don't want to leave a [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2557.12s)]
*  mess behind. You've got people who love you and depend on you. They have mortgage payments or [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2562.72s)]
*  credit card debt. They need money and you don't want to leave them in the lurch. And that has [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2567.9199999999996s)]
*  happened probably to people, you know, and that's why we're proud to partner with PolicyGenius. It's [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2572.7999999999997s)]

*  congressional oversight? I mean, you wonder about the committee chairman in the house, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2632.96s)]
*  a couple of Republicans who I know who seem to me as an outsider, sort of outsider, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2639.52s)]
*  completely controlled by the intelligences. Is that your perception? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2644.56s)]
*  I mean, look at Chuck Schumer's comment. They have six ways to Sunday to get back at you. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2650.0s)]
*  Remember when he said that to Rachel Maddow? And she didn't look too surprised. I think it's a known [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2656.08s)]
*  quantity. Obviously it goes back to Hoover. That was very well known within Intel. People say, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2664.56s)]
*  oh yeah, you know, that guy has a Hoover file on him, meaning this or that policymaker. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2671.52s)]
*  Something is known that means that. So that's real. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2678.32s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, I look at the speaker of the house whose views on everything kind of [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2682.32s)]
*  changed instantly on the foreign policy questions. And I think that's a very good [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2687.52s)]
*  question. I mean, there's never been a more obedient speaker to the will and whims of the [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2692.8s)]
*  Intel community than Mike Johnson. And you sort of wonder like, what is that? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2700.4s)]
*  Well, I don't know the answer, but. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2704.2400000000002s)]
*  You look at the legislation that has come up through the house on multiple things, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2706.4s)]
*  on election integrity, on EMP preparedness, both are two completely different things. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2714.4s)]
*  Both of them actually, the SHIELD Act in both cases, but several other iterations [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2721.84s)]
*  that passed the house with real bipartisan support and then just got completely gummed [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2728.4s)]
*  up in the Senate. And these are things that seem to be very, very important. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2735.36s)]
*  Seem so unassailable and supported across the board by, you know, regular American voters and [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2743.04s)]
*  the base across both parties that you have to ask what Hoover files are involved. And if not a Hoover [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2754.08s)]
*  file, then a second house wherever. But I think between- [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2766.96s)]
*  That's so corrupt. It's hard even to believe. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2775.28s)]
*  It is. It is. But it's harder to believe that we're not going to do anything to root it out. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2777.6s)]
*  And I think you have to name a problem and really recognize it before you can fix it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2783.52s)]
*  It's something that I admire about what, you know, Matt Taibbi and Schellenberger did with [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2789.4399999999996s)]
*  the Twitter files was for Elon to go in and say, you know, before I even touch anything on day one, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2796.8799999999997s)]
*  please document for posterity all of the abuses that have been happening here so that A, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2804.8799999999997s)]
*  we can fix them and B, the American people know this was happening and can prevent it from [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2812.8s)]
*  happening again. And, you know, if that hadn't happened, we wouldn't know what SESA had been up [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2819.44s)]
*  to, which also oversees election integrity, by the way, and how important that- [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2825.92s)]
*  It oversees election integrity? [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2831.44s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Those are it's too, it's too outside of, you know, bridges and ports and [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2835.2000000000003s)]
*  regular infrastructure. Those are it's too big focuses or censorship of social media and election [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2840.72s)]
*  integrity. Of course, you can't have election integrity with censorship because censorship [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2846.56s)]
*  is itself an interference in the democratic process. Certainly. I mean, when you look at the [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2855.12s)]
*  Hunter Biden laptop story and, you know, it's been so successfully kind of sidelined that [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2862.72s)]
*  it's hard to even bring up, honestly, we would kind of roll their eyes and go, [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2869.84s)]
*  not the Hunter Biden laptop story again. But what I find really astounding about that is that, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2873.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, it was Tony Blinken as a campaign official for now President Biden, who rang up [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2881.28s)]
*  the CIA and said, you know, we have a debate next week and we need to be able to rebut this and can [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2892.56s)]
*  you write this letter? And in it, I mean, it's just such clear politicization of our security [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2897.6s)]
*  services, which is foundationally against everything that I was taught. When I started [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2907.12s)]
*  there, I was told that if you had a partisan pin in the felt of your cubicle wall, you could be [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2913.92s)]
*  fired. And here we have, you know, that's for the rank and file, but the seventh floor [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2920.16s)]
*  are, you know, writing false intelligence estimates to get a presidential candidate out of [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2928.08s)]
*  hot water for his son's documentation of business deals that frankly look pretty corrupt [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2934.96s)]
*  and that the voter should get to make up their own mind about. And maybe you're somebody who [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2944.4s)]
*  would look at the correspondence in that laptop and not be bothered by it, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2953.04s)]
*  but you should get to make that decision before you cast your vote. And having a government agency [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2957.68s)]
*  where, you know, the CIA can come in and say, this is Russian disinformation, when it flat out [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2965.36s)]
*  was not, was completely authentic. And then CISA can actually get to work for the coming four years [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2975.44s)]
*  while that person is president, memory holding that because every single post about it is then [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2983.6s)]
*  flagged as misinformation is truly a violation of election integrity. If ever there was one, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=2990.56s)]
*  I mean, all of the studies around that, the polling around it say that it would have changed [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3001.7599999999998s)]
*  a sufficient enough votes to have an impact on the election. And if having your security services [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3007.52s)]
*  step in to lie about a foreign adversary's involvement in the election in order to conceal [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3013.12s)]
*  from voters correspondence of your own corrupt dealings with other foreign adversaries [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3023.3599999999997s)]
*  and have it change the outcome of the election is not interference. It's hard to know what is. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3031.92s)]
*  So nicely put. Were you shocked by that when you saw it? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3036.96s)]
*  I was shocked by it when I realized that it was intentionally manufactured in that way. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3043.84s)]
*  I mean, I think when I first heard it, you know, it seemed unlikely to me, but I hadn't really [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3055.04s)]
*  fully caught on at that point how manufactured the entire, you know, laptop story was. Like it [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3062.08s)]
*  seemed like too audacious an intrusion into domestic political life. I felt like they [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3075.92s)]
*  wouldn't have gone that far that publicly is to just out and out lie about it. And, you know, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3084.08s)]
*  and they did. And not only did they, but then the person who orchestrated it [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3092.24s)]
*  is now our secretary of state going and preaching democracy all around the world. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3101.2799999999997s)]
*  It's pretty dark. It must be bewildering for you who were once part of the machine. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3108.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3114.24s)]
*  I mean, I can walk around that building with my eyes closed and say, you know, that door goes to [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3114.56s)]
*  this office and that, and nowhere in any of those offices was the like overthrow governments and [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3124.0s)]
*  metal with domestic politics office. Right. So, you know, I was never exposed to it. And it could [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3130.72s)]
*  be because in the early days, I definitely threw up the flag on a few things and said, hey, this, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3141.12s)]
*  you know, they were using a lot of honorifics in the early days after 9-11 where kind of in English, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3146.64s)]
*  it would be like Mr. Doctor, you know, but after 9-11, everybody was sending in Arabic language [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3153.68s)]
*  threat reporting, or they were getting Arabic language threat reporting from their sources and [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3160.0s)]
*  they were not Arabic speakers. And so there were these huge files for people like Haji El Yemini, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3164.88s)]
*  just like someone who's completed the Hajj and comes from Yemen, which is, you know, many, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3174.08s)]
*  many people, to put it mildly. And so picking one person up and, you know, [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3180.96s)]
*  rendering them to another country because they fit that description when it's not a name and [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3191.52s)]
*  it's not an identifier was, you know, a human rights nightmare. Did that happen? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3196.48s)]
*  Different name, but I remember raising my hand around that because I was taking like Arabic 101 [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3203.92s)]
*  in my last year of grad school at Georgetown and I had a wonderful Egyptian professor and he had [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3211.76s)]
*  just done a class on honorifics at the beginning to kind of like warm people up and teach them [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3217.6s)]
*  pronunciation. And I was literally that far and I mean, so brand new. And if that hadn't happened, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3222.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have recognized it. And it ended up, you know, actually being right. I mean, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3228.3199999999997s)]
*  it was a wrong person and by the time that was recognized, they, you know, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3238.88s)]
*  force fed him through his nose and, you know, just a whole human rights nightmare. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3243.6s)]
*  I'm sorry to laugh. That's just so horrible. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3248.08s)]
*  It's so, so horrible as to not be- [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3251.6s)]
*  They force fed him through his nose? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3254.72s)]
*  Well, I'm sharing what was in public. Just to be clear, I'm sharing what was in [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3256.08s)]
*  the public account. So I, you know, I don't want to go beyond that, but it was the first time that I [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3262.56s)]
*  said, you know, this is, who do I talk to about this? This shouldn't be happening. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3269.28s)]
*  And I think from that moment on, my sense is that I was kind of put in the pile of like, this is a [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3274.5600000000004s)]
*  person who will make, she's not going to just go along, right? Like she will make trouble. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3281.0400000000004s)]
*  I think I got filtered out of the go foment coups and foreign country [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3289.12s)]
*  recruitment program, thank God. But I never witnessed any of that there. It was actually [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3299.12s)]
*  really once I left that in some ways, I feel like my education on the intelligence world began. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3304.96s)]
*  And I knew a lot of really great people there. Intellectually curious, smart, good hearted, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3310.96s)]
*  many theologians, many poets, like a really like interesting, unique group of people who argued a [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3318.24s)]
*  lot about where we should be and what we should be doing and the morality of things. I didn't find it [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3325.04s)]
*  to be an evil place at all. But I also am aware that I never came across any of the kinds of [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3330.72s)]
*  operations that now are being uncovered. And so I think I was working, keeping nuclear precursors [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3338.72s)]
*  out of the hands of terror suspects is like a fairly easy moral choice, right? And so I never [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3349.68s)]
*  was exposed to any of that. And it was deeply distressing after leaving to watch [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3360.72s)]
*  all of the subsequent declassifications of what was being done at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3368.72s)]
*  and you know, Cat's Eye in Thailand, and I hadn't been aware of any of that. And then [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3377.8399999999997s)]
*  to see it weaponized domestically was the, because of course, that's the end of that story. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3384.24s)]
*  When you really think about it. You know, there's no, in the end, the way that we treat other people [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3391.9199999999996s)]
*  is how we treat ourselves, the way that we treat people outside ends up in our home. You know, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3398.4s)]
*  it's just the natural way of things. And I think it's no surprise when we've [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3402.7200000000003s)]
*  subjugated the world into kind of us versus them thinking and control, being at our kind of [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3409.92s)]
*  benevolent control, being our love language globally as a nation, that, you know, our leaders [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3415.52s)]
*  end up doing the same thing at home and feeling like it's noble. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3425.92s)]
*  So again, nicely put, you made reference a moment ago to changes [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3433.6s)]
*  under, in the first years of the Biden administration, first months, to our EMP [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3441.6s)]
*  preparedness. Can you explain what an EMP is and what changed? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3446.08s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is increasingly relevant now. And it's a great credit to President Trump that [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3452.64s)]
*  he prepared us for it. And then unfortunately, to President Biden, that he revoked it. So let me [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3461.28s)]
*  sort of explain a little about what it is. Do you remember over the last couple of weeks, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3466.48s)]
*  there've been solar storms and we've gotten to see the Northern Lights much farther south, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3474.96s)]
*  which is beautiful. And maybe people were warned there might be slight disruptions to electronics, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3481.36s)]
*  but for the most part, it's been beautiful and uneventful. Those solar storms can be [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3486.7200000000003s)]
*  far more powerful than that, naturally. So before even getting into human weaponizing of that, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3495.76s)]
*  there have been lots of examples, but the Carrington event is probably the best known, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3504.96s)]
*  right, in 1859. And was so, I mean, it's set, you know, telegraph operators on fire, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3510.8s)]
*  set forest fires, you damage the transatlantic cable miles beneath the ocean. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3522.4s)]
*  And NASA says that were it to happen again, now given the interconnected electrical grid that [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3529.84s)]
*  didn't exist then, that, you know, we'd be looking at darkness around most of the globe, [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3539.2s)]
*  possibly for years, up to seven years is what they have said. And that these [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3546.88s)]
*  electromagnetic ejections happen from the sun every 100 to 150 years of that magnitude. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3552.88s)]
*  Of course, that was, you know, in 1850. So we're coming up due for one. Their current estimate is [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3557.84s)]
*  about 12% chance per decade. It's a non-zero chance, fairly likely that in our lifetime or [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3565.36s)]
*  our kid's lifetime, we will experience another one of these Carrington events. In fact, there was one [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3573.52s)]
*  in 2012 that came extremely close to us that would have been a very, very, very, very, very [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3577.04s)]
*  close. So it would have been absolutely catastrophic, but didn't, didn't hit. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3582.64s)]
*  And then that would mean no electricity for years. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3585.68s)]
*  Right. And that, you know, that sounds inconvenient. And, you know, maybe people can see how it would be, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3589.52s)]
*  you know, it would cause some loss of life. But I think there's part of us when we hear that, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3597.04s)]
*  that thinks like, I could use a break from Twitter, you know, it might be kind of nice. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3601.12s)]
*  The thing is that what, what people don't realize is that the world is no longer what it was in the [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3606.56s)]
*  19th century, that, that almost everything at this point involves what they call SCADA systems, which [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3615.2s)]
*  are these small computers that use sensors to move valves or, you know, whether it's how many, how [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3622.96s)]
*  much natural gas can move through a pipeline, when to turn on the coolers in a nuclear power [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3632.72s)]
*  plant to make sure that there's not a meltdown, when to allow water to go over the Hoover Dam [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3638.16s)]
*  to prevent flooding, you know, air traffic control, traffic lights, and so on, all operated by SCADA [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3645.3599999999997s)]
*  systems now. And those are all susceptible to this exact same kind of attack. Or in the early [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3654.56s)]
*  day, you know, what we were just talking about was in the, in the case of a solar flare, but [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3666.96s)]
*  humans being what they are, they've learned to weaponize this, right? And we know this because [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3671.92s)]
*  we have done it. Starfish Prime was the first test in 62, where the US realized that [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3676.32s)]
*  this could be used as a weapon and did the test above the Pacific and it knocked out, you know, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3684.72s)]
*  capabilities in Hawaii and farther beyond. And so there was that recognition. We now know that the [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3692.4s)]
*  Soviets figured it out even earlier. They told us during the kind of detente in the 90s, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3699.52s)]
*  that they had already done seven tests at that point over Kazakhstan and wiped the entire power [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3705.92s)]
*  grid of Kazakhstan, actually, you know, created a lot of suffering in the process. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3711.36s)]
*  But they saw it as having huge potential as a weapon because of that and began developing out, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3716.96s)]
*  you know, what they called a super EMP, which is very specifically tuned, not for yield, but for [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3724.4s)]
*  electromagnetic pulse. And these are, you know, these are detonated 30 kilometers or so above a [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3735.92s)]
*  country. So you're not actually destroying anybody with the, with the explosion. It is with the, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3741.12s)]
*  using the EMPs to kill the grid. What is now by many of our adversaries mentioned in their military [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3748.8s)]
*  manuals is no contact wars. So this is, you know, win World War Three without ever having to have [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3755.52s)]
*  contact with the adversary. And when you look at the delivery mechanisms that are available here, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3762.32s)]
*  and the way that we're seeing EMPs discussed in China and Iran and Russia, North Korea, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3770.56s)]
*  there are a wide variety of them. I mean, North Korea in 2013 ran the exact optimal orbit with [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  its KSM-3 satellite over New York and Washington DC, that would be the optimal delivery for this [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3790.7200000000003s)]
*  kind of a weapon. And on the very same day, in April of 2013, sent military special forces, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3798.8s)]
*  essentially, that have never been identified in to break into a substation PG&E substation near San [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3811.52s)]
*  Jose in California and North Korean, well, thought to be North Korean, never actually identified or [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3824.72s)]
*  apprehended exactly the same day on the West Coast that they did the satellite run on the East Coast. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3834.3199999999997s)]
*  What they do at the PG&E substation, gas and electric, by the way, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3841.04s)]
*  yes, for our East Coast viewers. They were assessed to be extremely professional by the [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3845.52s)]
*  the SEAL trainers who came in later to look at the site. They knew about an underground comms [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3853.2s)]
*  tunnel that they went in and cut communications and use sniper fire to damage but not take offline [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3858.72s)]
*  17 transformers. In the United States? In the United States. Yep. We had a North Korean team [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3869.52s)]
*  of saboteurs or saboteurs sent by North Korea. Certainly professional special forces of some [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3876.32s)]
*  variety thought to be North Korean. Just outside San Jose in Coyote, California. We did an interview [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3882.4s)]
*  with a woman called Casey Means. She's a Stanford educated surgeon. And really one of the most [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3893.12s)]
*  remarkable people I have ever met. In the interview, she explained how the food that we eat [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3899.2s)]
*  produced by huge food companies, big food in conjunction with pharma is destroying our health, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3905.4399999999996s)]
*  making this a weak and sick country. The levels of chronic disease are beyond belief. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3912.72s)]
*  What Casey Means, we've not stopped thinking about ever since, is the co-founder of a healthcare [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3919.12s)]
*  technology company called Levels. And we are proud to announce today that we are partnering [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3924.96s)]
*  with Levels. And by proud, I mean sincerely proud. Levels is a really interesting company [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3930.08s)]
*  and a great product. It gives you insight into what's going on inside your body, your [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3935.84s)]
*  metabolic health. It helps you understand how the food that you're eating, the things that you're [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3940.4s)]
*  doing every single day are affecting your body in real time. You put stuff in your mouth, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3944.48s)]
*  speaking for myself anyway, and you don't think about it. You have no idea what you're putting [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3950.64s)]
*  in your mouth and you have no idea what it's doing to your body. But over time, you feel weak [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3954.4s)]
*  and tired and spacey and over an even longer period of time, you can get really sick. So it's [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3959.52s)]
*  worth knowing what the food you eat is doing to you. The Levels app works with something called [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3964.64s)]
*  the Continuous Glucose Monitor, a CGM. You can get one as part of the plan or you can bring your own, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3970.8s)]
*  it doesn't matter. But the bottom line is big tech, big pharma and big food combine together [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3976.1600000000003s)]
*  to form an incredibly malevolent force, pumping you full of garbage on healthy food with artificial [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3983.76s)]
*  sugars and hurting you and hurting the entire country. So with Levels, you'll be able to see [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3989.76s)]
*  immediately what all this is doing to you. You get access to real time personalized data and that's [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=3994.48s)]
*  a critical step to changing your behavior. Those of us who like Oreos can tell you firsthand. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4000.0s)]
*  This isn't talking to your doctor at an annual physical, looking backwards about things you did [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4005.6800000000003s)]
*  in the past. This is up to the second information on how your body is responding to different foods [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4010.4s)]
*  and activities, the things that give you stress, your sleep, et cetera, et cetera. It's easy to use, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4016.48s)]
*  gives you powerful personalized health data and you can make much better choices about how you [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4022.7200000000003s)]
*  feel. And over time, it'll have a huge effect. Right now, you can get an additional two free months [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4027.44s)]
*  when you go to levels.link.tucker. That's levels.link.tucker. This is the beginning of what we hope will be [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4032.56s)]
*  a long and happy partnership with Levels and Dr. Casey Means. I was an adult in 2013. Obama was [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4040.16s)]
*  president. I was reading the news. I don't remember reading about this. No, it was very, very downplayed [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4048.96s)]
*  as vandalism. And two months later, July, we had, or a few months later, in July, they found two [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4055.68s)]
*  SA-2 nuclear-capable missiles in the bay of a tanker in the Gulf of Mexico. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4070.96s)]
*  And this was all really as the North Korean tensions were mounting, which President Trump gets [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4082.16s)]
*  far too little credit, in my opinion, for that resolution or detente. And now, under Biden-Harris, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4090.96s)]
*  we have North Korean troops being pulled by Putin into the war in Ukraine. So that escalation is [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4099.2s)]
*  back in play again. But those are three distinct ways to attack our electrical grid that were all [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4106.32s)]
*  mounted within a handful of months. And as a result, in 2014, NORAD announced that they were [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4115.04s)]
*  fully moving and investing hundreds of millions of dollars into further RAD-hardening Cheyenne [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4124.72s)]
*  Mountain. So they've taken it very seriously for their own force protection, which is good, [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4129.76s)]
*  but not for the rest of us. And can you just give us the cliff notes on what that means, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4136.64s)]
*  hardening Cheyenne Mountain? Okay. So it's actually very easy. If you put your phone in the microwave, [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4141.92s)]
*  right, it is safe from this kind of electromagnetic radiation. And so the question is, [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4148.32s)]
*  when you look at something as complex as our entire national grid, what are the nodes that are most [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4157.599999999999s)]
*  vulnerable to this kind of attack? And really, there are sort of two categories that are [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4165.28s)]
*  highest consequence. One are the escape systems that would allow for the resulting forest fires [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4172.64s)]
*  and nuclear meltdowns and floods and plane crashes and hospital failures and traffic crashes and so [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4179.92s)]
*  forth if they fail. And they are as easy to protect as putting them in a metal shed instead of a [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4188.0s)]
*  wooden shed or taking the wooden sheds that exist and covering them with metal mesh to the point [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4195.52s)]
*  that you could put that out for people in each community with specs. And I'm sure that they would [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4204.56s)]
*  get together on a Sunday and do it, but regulation in our country doesn't allow us to do that. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4211.6s)]
*  So the escape systems protecting those and then the extra high voltage transformers are [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4217.68s)]
*  a huge issue and sticking point for our grid. They only make about 200 of them a year [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4229.2s)]
*  and they're incredibly expensive, hundreds of tons to move. And the coils are done mostly by [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4236.4800000000005s)]
*  hand amazingly. I mean, they're custom made and they were invented here in the US. Tesla invented [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4243.68s)]
*  them here, but we don't make them anymore. And most of the ones for export are made in Germany [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4249.6s)]
*  or South Korea and they're designed custom for each spot. So it's very hard to have extras for [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4256.4800000000005s)]
*  each one on hand. And they need to be in Faraday cages, which sounds fancy, but it's basically just [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4265.36s)]
*  a wire mesh cage. And the benefit of this, in addition to protecting against this kind of attack, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4276.96s)]
*  is that there are a lot of other grid vulnerabilities that are maybe lower damage [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4286.639999999999s)]
*  when they happen, but higher likelihood. An EMP attack or a solar flare are low probability high [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4293.2s)]
*  catastrophe events, but weather related damage is the opposite or sometimes catastrophic in [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4300.96s)]
*  its impact as we've seen recently in North Carolina and elsewhere. And a lot of the same [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4308.5599999999995s)]
*  guards around, especially around protecting from cascading skater failures where the [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4315.44s)]
*  surges can be prevented is really important to the EMP safety, but also [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4329.679999999999s)]
*  would help prevent in those kinds of storm environments. And then you look at sabotage [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4337.679999999999s)]
*  and vandalism, which is another really big issue that they have to protect against. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4341.84s)]
*  And a Faraday cage, depending on its construction can also prevent people from seeing where it is [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4346.4800000000005s)]
*  that they're letting off small arms fire or that they're targeting, which we see. I mean, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4351.84s)]
*  when I drove in here, when you first arrive in your town on the left, there's a little substation [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4359.04s)]
*  and it has a chain like fence around it, no cameras. And that's the same all over the country. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4367.04s)]
*  And everyone just sees those, they see the little coils and don't really think much of it. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4372.96s)]
*  I've been here 50 years and never noticed it was there. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4379.5199999999995s)]
*  That's right. I mean, and that's true. Our eye just, we're so accustomed to filtering these things [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4382.96s)]
*  out, but the entire basis of our life and our community and our country and our national security [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4389.44s)]
*  and our healthcare, our financial system all relies on them. And it's not just detonating [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4396.24s)]
*  a nuclear weapon above the United States. Obviously there's a deterrent effect. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4403.92s)]
*  There would be a response because Cheyenne Mountain and other parts are completely [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4411.679999999999s)]
*  red hearted. So even if the entire country were out, the United States would be able to respond [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4416.639999999999s)]
*  and has had subs overseas and so on. But you can achieve pretty much the same impact [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4422.400000000001s)]
*  with commercially available EMP suitcases that you can buy for industrial reasons with no, [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4431.6s)]
*  you know, no special license or anything like that. And, you know, if you pick the right nine [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4438.96s)]
*  substations to put that suitcase next to, you have achieved the exact same thing. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4446.96s)]
*  And as you can see, you know, with the San Jose attack, those people were never actually seen on [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4453.84s)]
*  camera and they were never, I mean, you can see them as figures, but they were never identified. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4460.56s)]
*  So there's vandalism, there are natural weather events, including the solar flares, the storms [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4465.36s)]
*  that you mentioned, and then there's EMP. So the threats to the grid and to the lives of 350 million [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4473.12s)]
*  Americans are completely real and in some sense imminent. Like we know this is going to happen. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4480.64s)]
*  So the federal response hardening the grid changed when Biden got elected? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4486.16s)]
*  Yeah. And this is what is really hard to accept. And it's very similar actually to what happened [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4494.48s)]
*  with the border wall, which is here you have two policies, the EMP executive order, the President [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4501.2s)]
*  Trump was the first president to ever direct all parts of government to work together to be sure [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4507.04s)]
*  that the American people were protected from intentional EMP attack after decades of knowing that [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4514.72s)]
*  our primary adversaries were all considering it training for it, had weapons programs designed [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4523.92s)]
*  to do this. And by the way, I mean, before we get to Biden, [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4529.120000000001s)]
*  the primary delivery mechanism in all of those tests was a high altitude balloon. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4536.4800000000005s)]
*  When we then have China, a primary adversary who we know have talked in their training [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4544.320000000001s)]
*  sessions and their training manuals about using high altitude balloons [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4553.4400000000005s)]
*  to deliver this kind of an EMP device and have done tests where it's the same exact payload as [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4557.04s)]
*  the high altitude balloons that were recovered. And then you have Russia. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4562.8s)]
*  I'm sure you remember last year, Washington worked itself into quite a justified, in my opinion, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4570.48s)]
*  state about the quote unquote space nuke, right? Putting a nuclear weapon into orbit [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4577.76s)]
*  on a satellite. And at the time, the media made it out like this was maybe a danger. And even if [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4584.16s)]
*  it was a danger, it was only a danger to other satellites, right? And it would get in the way of [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4593.2s)]
*  your car's GPS. And maybe it would be problematic for the military. And so we should pay attention [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4598.639999999999s)]
*  to it. But they definitely downplayed its impact on anyone on the ground, right? And yet we know [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4606.0s)]
*  from past Russian trials and the SA-3 satellite that the North Koreans sent over, that this kind [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4612.88s)]
*  of delivery is the exact same setup as an anti-satellite weapon. You put a nuclear weapon on [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4626.5599999999995s)]
*  a satellite headed up from the South where we have virtually no detection set up. And [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4636.16s)]
*  you don't even get the 22 minutes that you would get with a solar flare. It just comes completely [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4646.88s)]
*  out of the blue and there's no preparation whatsoever. And in general, in the military [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4652.96s)]
*  theory of these adversaries, it's a multi-pronged attack, right? That's the initial, you take out, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4660.32s)]
*  send everybody into chaos and you take out their ability to communicate with one another. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4668.48s)]
*  And then it's followed by whatever comes next. And for us to have seen that in war games, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4671.759999999999s)]
*  in at least two of our largest adversaries, both Iran and Russia have included in their training [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4685.36s)]
*  simulations. It's in three of their manuals, China, Russia and Iran. Russia, we know is putting a [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4691.2s)]
*  nuclear weapon in orbit. China's sending the space balloons, I mean, the Hylosu balloons have already [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4700.879999999999s)]
*  come across our own territory. North Korea, three-way attack simulation that all three were [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4707.36s)]
*  successful. Clearly, this is on the minds of our adversaries and it's an imminent danger. Certainly, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4717.839999999999s)]
*  the area in which we are most vulnerable for maximum casualties and impact. And yet, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4725.36s)]
*  President Trump was the first president to say across different parts of government, [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4737.679999999999s)]
*  who sometimes have a hard time talking to one another, I want you to work together [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4743.92s)]
*  to make sure that the American people are protected from this. And by the way, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4748.48s)]
*  it's not even that expensive in the big scheme of government spending. To do it really well, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4752.32s)]
*  the cost estimate was $2 billion, which we've just sent another $100 billion to Ukraine. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4759.599999999999s)]
*  So then Biden takes office and frankly, in my mind, just inconceivably revokes that. And [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4766.64s)]
*  in the same way that he says with the wall, both of those, to my mind, are initiatives that are [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4781.360000000001s)]
*  already underway, that are designed to protect the American people's security and homeland. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4788.64s)]
*  And he reversed with no replacement plan in place. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4801.280000000001s)]
*  BD But with the border wall, you could, and I think that's a more complex topic than [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4807.84s)]
*  we appreciate. What is the point of what they just did? I don't know. But at least there was [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4815.280000000001s)]
*  a perceived political constituency in favor of mass immigration. They thought it would [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4821.200000000001s)]
*  make it a one-party state. That's why they're for it. Got it. What could possibly be the motive [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4827.200000000001s)]
*  for not defending yourself in a sensible way from an EMP attack? I don't get that at all. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4833.92s)]
*  Support from the electrical industry. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4838.88s)]
*  Yeah, there's a huge amount of pushback. So it gets a little bit in the weeds and boring, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4843.280000000001s)]
*  but there are these two things, the NERC and the FERC. And they are supposed to regulate one [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4848.400000000001s)]
*  another basically, or FERC is supposed to regulate NERC. And unsurprisingly, in that kind of a cozy [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4854.160000000001s)]
*  relationship, it doesn't work. And they do have some self-imposed EMP standards, but they are [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4862.96s)]
*  for a reasonably light solar storm and would not come anywhere close to being able to withstand [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4871.04s)]
*  any kind of nuclear fallout and really push back on the costs that would be involved. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4876.96s)]
*  And it could be passed on to consumers at 20 cents per consumer per year, which I think most [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4885.76s)]
*  consumers when they really understand that this would keep their power on not just in [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4894.96s)]
*  those extreme circumstances, but also help in storms and with vandalism and with these other. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4901.92s)]
*  And keep millions from starving to death. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4906.4s)]
*  Billions potentially. I mean, these are global. I mean, in our country, but these certainly will [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4908.88s)]
*  be global issues and there will be global competition for the very slow to build transformers [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4917.44s)]
*  that would fix them. And so it's really important to recognize that everybody else will be going [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4924.72s)]
*  through the same thing at the same time. It's not like you can find a way to walk to outside of that [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4931.84s)]
*  area so that you can get order something and bring it back in, right? In terms of rebuilding [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4938.0s)]
*  your grid. So potentially catastrophic non-zero chance of it happening. I mean, 12% per decade [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4943.84s)]
*  is, and I should say that the EMP committee that Congress put in place and unfortunately was [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4952.4s)]
*  disbanded under President Obama, but prior to that included really the intelligence community's [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4963.2s)]
*  best analysts based on all of the testing that they'd seen hostile countries to their estimate [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4970.4s)]
*  was eight to nine out of every 10 Americans could lose their life by the end of the first year, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4976.32s)]
*  which is a staggering and almost impossible to believe estimate until you realize that, [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4983.28s)]
*  you know, within obviously at the outset, you have half a million people in the air at any given time [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4989.04s)]
*  on a thousand flights, right? So that's lost right away. And then everyone on an airplane does, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=4995.12s)]
*  right? So that's half a million people at any moment, any given moment. And then you have, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5000.96s)]
*  you know, obviously traffic and everything that happens in that immediate chaos. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5008.64s)]
*  But very quickly after that, the SCADA systems begin to fail and you have fire, you have flood [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5016.879999999999s)]
*  within 72 hours, you have meltdown at all nuclear facilities. And then refrigeration has gone out [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5023.5199999999995s)]
*  at supermarkets and other regional food warehouses. So the food supply ends. There's no, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5034.799999999999s)]
*  there's no, you know, there's no access to ATMs or money or financial structure of any type, [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5042.24s)]
*  no access to your prescription medications, you know, no access to law enforcement [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5049.360000000001s)]
*  and no clean water and no food. So unless, you know, you have your Berkey that you can put [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5054.8s)]
*  lake water in and, you know, a year's worth of food and a way to protect yourself, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5062.32s)]
*  you know, which the vast majority of Americans don't have. You are in an incredibly vulnerable [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5070.5599999999995s)]
*  position that there's absolutely no reason to risk putting our own people. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5076.799999999999s)]
*  And if you're, and that's just for people who are outside the cities, but if you're in the middle of [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5080.32s)]
*  tightly packed metro area, you're just done. And this, I mean, I can't even imagine people's [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5085.84s)]
*  having, you know, covered chaos in Baghdad and Hurricane Katrina, you know, anyone who's ever [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5091.52s)]
*  seen the, you know, disappearance of authority knows that like within hours, people start going [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5097.84s)]
*  crazy and hurting each other. And you have, you know, you have your kids in your apartment [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5103.84s)]
*  and how do you get them out? And how do you get them to safety? And where do you take them? And, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5107.68s)]
*  you know, the prospect of even rolling any kind of dice to put our own people in that situation [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5112.0s)]
*  while then glibly taking the money that we could spend doing that and instead send it to arm [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5120.88s)]
*  Ukraine when sending ballistic missiles into Russia using American satellites, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5130.88s)]
*  you know, puts us in a direct hot war with Russia for the first time ever. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5140.639999999999s)]
*  You know, that actually puts us at a higher risk of this kind of attack than ever in our history. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5146.72s)]
*  And at a moment where instead of spending our money to protect ourselves from that attack, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5154.8s)]
*  we're actually spending our money to provoke that attack. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5160.4s)]
*  So I don't know that one in a million Americans has ever heard any, really anything you just said, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5176.0s)]
*  or certainly not heard it fleshed out in the way that you just did. And yet, when you hear it, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5204.56s)]
*  it makes sense. And it's clearly true. So that raises the question about our information, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5210.080000000001s)]
*  you know, the integrity of our information sources. And why aren't we hearing this from the [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5215.280000000001s)]
*  press from the media? I don't understand that. Well, you know, I think there's a party line [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5221.52s)]
*  right now in the media, if you haven't noticed. And this, I think, does not support the security [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5227.76s)]
*  state's thesis about how safe the current administration has made us in the world, right? [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5238.0s)]
*  And, you know, when you look at the economy versus stability, that, you know, four years ago, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5247.84s)]
*  and now it is just absolutely clear that we should be talking about the fact that the world has been [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5260.32s)]
*  set on fire over the last four years. And yet it's really not front and center in our news at all, [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5266.16s)]
*  with the exception of the Middle East, which, you know, gets, I think, pretty slanted coverage. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5271.360000000001s)]
*  So, you know, having come through two years of the RFK campaign, I will tell you it is, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5278.96s)]
*  I mean, it's truly amazing to me how, to what degree a media blackout really [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5290.320000000001s)]
*  can be coordinated and be successful. Tell us, what was your experience? [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5296.08s)]
*  I mean, it was clear to me pretty early on that, you know, if you were someone who had heard [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5301.2s)]
*  from Bobby, then you were someone who was at least considering voting for him. And many of those [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5309.6s)]
*  people, you know, were very clear that he should be the next president of the United States. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5317.92s)]
*  So you're either somebody who had heard from Bobby or you were somebody who had heard about Bobby, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5323.2s)]
*  right, from your cable news source or from your newspaper and so on. And, you know, you begin to [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5327.28s)]
*  realize when you're on the inside of, you know, the receiving end of all of that, is that every [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5335.04s)]
*  place, you know, anything that you know about this election, you know about it because you have [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5342.4s)]
*  read, heard or seen it on a platform that has a commercial interest in the outcome of the election, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5348.719999999999s)]
*  right? I mean, you look at Google, hundreds of millions of dollars in pharmaceutical ad revenue, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5357.04s)]
*  billions of dollars in pharmaceutical ad revenue, that Bobby said in his very first speech when he [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5365.28s)]
*  announced for president that he would bring us in line with the rest of the world by banning [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5371.12s)]
*  pharmaceutical advertising on TV. You know, what business do you know that is going to give [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5374.32s)]
*  fair coverage to somebody that could cost them billions of dollars a year in their business [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5380.32s)]
*  model? You know, it's not in their fiduciary interest. And it's the same, you know, we see it [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5384.16s)]
*  with certainly all the cable news channels who are also reliant on pharmaceutical advertising. And then, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5389.36s)]
*  you know, the reliance, I mean, Bobby's determination to cut excess military funding [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5395.76s)]
*  when so many of these media companies have board entanglements or common ownership with [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5402.96s)]
*  defense contractors or are themselves. I mean, you look at Amazon Web Services and the Washington [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5409.84s)]
*  Post and, you know, GE and NBC and so forth. I mean, there's a long, long history of that. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5414.08s)]
*  How much does Boeing spend on Politico every year? But so that is kind of the I didn't understand [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5420.24s)]
*  this actually until Bobby explained it to me, having spent my entire life in the media in [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5426.4s)]
*  television, not realizing that the point of the pharmaceutical ads was not to sell the drugs to [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5430.88s)]
*  consumers who can't prescribe the drugs to themselves, of course, that never made sense [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5435.92s)]
*  to me. And I didn't get the obvious point, which is it's protection money. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5439.84s)]
*  Yep. That's exactly how I never got that. I mean, sometimes you even see the Boeing ad or, [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5443.28s)]
*  you know, the Northrop ads and it's like, impossibly as a consumer, you there's it's you actually can't [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5448.72s)]
*  there's no way to buy their product. There's like completely naked bribery. But I never thought of [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5453.6s)]
*  that. Yeah, like why you're like, why are you advertising in Politico? Like what is to get a [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5460.16s)]
*  buy a bomber? It's to keep its reporters from criticizing. That's right. It is their entire [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5466.5599999999995s)]
*  expenditures. It's their salary and they know it. And, you know, a free market is a free market. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5472.5599999999995s)]
*  Fine. But when when voters are so steeped in a media environment, and especially with algorithmic [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5480.5599999999995s)]
*  things where, you know, they're seeing their Google News feed, and every single time they see [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5489.2s)]
*  Bobby's name, he's like a psychopathic, crazy dog eating, you know, joke, right. And that was [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5494.16s)]
*  their approach was either to absolutely not cover him whatsoever. I mean, he would give these [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5502.32s)]
*  extraordinary speech at this peace speech that he did in New Hampshire in the at the outset of the [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5507.2s)]
*  campaign. And the America strong speech about building a unity government based on Lincoln's [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5512.16s)]
*  team of rivals were two of the most incredible speeches of the campaign. And neither of them, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5520.24s)]
*  they were all attended by 3040 reporters with cameras, obviously waiting for him to say some [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5527.44s)]
*  terrible things so they could play that one clip. And then none of them ran any of it because they, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5533.679999999999s)]
*  you know, because they were such strong speeches. And so we, we were up against that throughout. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5538.24s)]
*  And you know, how the American I mean, obviously been around, you worked at BBC, you've been around [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5544.24s)]
*  the American media, you're for your whole life, but did you appreciate how this works before you [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5548.96s)]
*  started running this campaign? Not nearly to the degree that you know, the the degree of [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5556.24s)]
*  politicization was surprising to me. And I think I had not really come to understand the, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5562.32s)]
*  the kind of deep commercial drivers behind editorial lines. And, you know, I guess had a [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5570.96s)]
*  little bit of idealism still from the old like, Edward R. Moreau, like, you know, there must be [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5578.72s)]
*  some journalists still out there kind of thing. And they've been very few and far between. I mean, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5584.16s)]
*  I really, I'm hard pressed even come up with an example, glad to be sitting across from you. But [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5590.8s)]
*  I will say thank God for Elon Musk. Yes. I mean, I really believe that every American should include [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5597.92s)]
*  him and his family in their prayers every day because, you know, he is holding our constitution [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5604.56s)]
*  together right now. And, you know, even the Internet Archive is offline now. So there's [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5611.360000000001s)]
*  nothing left. There's no other way to know. And sure, are there things on there that turn out not [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5616.8s)]
*  to be true? Absolutely. Are there things on there that you're going to disagree with or find offensive? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5622.400000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. And, you know, such as the nature of free speech, and it's audacious and bold and [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5626.72s)]
*  beautiful and sometimes infuriating, but that's what we've built our entire country on. And when [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5634.56s)]
*  it, I mean, I remember recently explaining this to my daughter and, and she was, you know, she's five. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5640.16s)]
*  And she was asking me why, why I'm always traveling. I'm working in the moment. And, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5647.92s)]
*  and I was explaining about the importance of free speech and, and how I wanted her to have it when [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5654.0s)]
*  she was older. And she said, so are there countries where if you criticize the leader, [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5661.12s)]
*  you know, they'll put you in jail? And I said, yes, there are, there are a lot of those countries. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5666.56s)]
*  That used to be all the countries, basically. And when you, when you go back and you look at the, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5670.16s)]
*  at the audacity of what that idea was at the beginning and the fact that it wasn't happening [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5677.44s)]
*  anywhere else, and then hundreds, you know, of, of other countries now have followed suit, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5682.88s)]
*  and that we're just going to give that up for the short sighted gain of one political party and one [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5688.64s)]
*  election cycle, or one blob for, you know, five to 10 election cycles while, you know, their lust for [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5697.2s)]
*  power continues. And that as a result, because no government is ever going to cede power given to it [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5704.88s)]
*  in an emergency. So even once that runs its course, it still means that my kids' kids [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5710.96s)]
*  will not have the freedom of speech that, you know, that they, that is their birthright [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5717.6s)]
*  given to them by our country's founders. And I just can't, I can't abide that. I can't let it happen. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5724.72s)]
*  And to see Elon, who wasn't even born in this country, step up and defy the commercial interests, [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5730.8s)]
*  you know, I don't know his finances, but it seems to me that he has taken a serious financial hit. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5740.160000000001s)]
*  Oh, serious. To protect. He's not a money worshiper. Right. Unlike so many billionaires, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5748.160000000001s)]
*  just to be blunt, they're money worshipers. That's why they're billionaires. Right. He's not. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5754.160000000001s)]
*  No. And I, I think he is genuinely driven by [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5758.160000000001s)]
*  the desire to see human freedom endure. And I don't know why more of us are not, because [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5763.68s)]
*  there's nothing more important. And it's ours to lose, you know, and [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5774.4800000000005s)]
*  it's bewildering to me when I hear people say, well, you know, our government can be trusted with [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5785.4400000000005s)]
*  those. Like they can make the judgment of what I should be able to say and what I shouldn't. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5791.2s)]
*  And you just, the idea that, but what about the next leader? You know, every government, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5795.76s)]
*  is it, is it Federalist 51, the one that where Madison talks about, you know, if men were angels, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5802.96s)]
*  we wouldn't need government. And if government were angels, it wouldn't need to be regulated. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5809.36s)]
*  But we are making, you know, the challenge is making a government of men over men. And [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5813.12s)]
*  yet they took on that challenge and achieved it so beautifully. And I remember Mr. Saar at NCS, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5819.52s)]
*  my last two years of high school in DC, when I came back to the United States, telling, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5829.120000000001s)]
*  telling us about Skokie versus Illinois and I just, and just being incredibly [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5836.4800000000005s)]
*  moved by the courage that it takes as a society to defend such abhorrent speech. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5840.64s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5847.84s)]
*  Because you know that, you know, it's, it's not a sliding skit. It's just, you either have it or [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5848.4800000000005s)]
*  you don't. I mean, it's Salman Rushdie who says the minute somebody says, I believe in free speech, [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5854.080000000001s)]
*  except, you know, stop them right there because they don't need to finish the sentence. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5858.72s)]
*  But I get, I just refer back to my first question. You know, I think it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5862.4800000000005s)]
*  my first question, which is since I'm so familiar with, you know, all the schools you went to, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5869.12s)]
*  the credentials you have, you know, the world that you're from, I mean, you've got to be in the one [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5875.84s)]
*  tenth of 1% of people, you know, who've taken this position. You took such an unpopular position. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5881.5199999999995s)]
*  And I know, you know, you're married into the family and all that, but still you became Bobby [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5886.64s)]
*  Kennedy's campaign manager. And now Bobby Kennedy's endorsed Trump. And I just don't think [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5890.24s)]
*  you could hoist a bigger middle finger in the face of the world that you're from. I mean, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5897.84s)]
*  I just know that because I know that world. So like, did you even hesitate before doing that? [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5901.28s)]
*  What was your thinking? And like, I'm sure none of your classmates did anything like that. Why did [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5905.84s)]
*  you do that? You know, I think that if you gave them the choice, I mean, if they came down from [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5910.0s)]
*  Mars and you put the exact, you know, what is happening right now in front of them without the [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5919.52s)]
*  names of the parties or the names of the participants and said, you know, you have one [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5926.4s)]
*  four-year stint where no new wars are started, where, you know, bread costs half of what it costs [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5933.28s)]
*  now, gas a third, you know, et cetera, et cetera, you know, rises in standard of living across the [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5941.679999999999s)]
*  country, lower suicide rates, lower depression, you know, lower homelessness, lower incarceration, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5949.04s)]
*  lower immigration that is, you know, illegal and results in children being lost around the country. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5957.12s)]
*  And then you compare it with four years of another government that is endorsed by the way, [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5969.76s)]
*  by Dick Cheney now and a host of neocons that involves two new wars, you know, printing $8 [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5977.2s)]
*  trillion of additional debt that is a tax on the poor and on future generations in order to pay [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5986.24s)]
*  for more war, more children going into poverty, more, you know, that we have a real unemployment [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=5995.12s)]
*  rate of 25% in this country, a quarter when you take into account people who want a full-time job [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6006.72s)]
*  and don't have one or people who have a full-time job but don't make $25,000 a year, [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6013.92s)]
*  which is not a living wage. If you take that into account, we have 24.9% true unemployment rate. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6018.400000000001s)]
*  So when you, I think that you asked about people in my world, I think if you put any of that to them [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6025.04s)]
*  and then on top of that said, you know, and this leader that has plunged people into poverty and [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6030.56s)]
*  unemployment and, you know, had two additional wars started on his watch is censoring [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6035.68s)]
*  speech on social media, weaponizing the courts to take people of his own party and every single [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6045.52s)]
*  other party off of the ballot. I mean, literally, Dean Phillips, Marion Williamson, Robert Kennedy [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6052.240000000001s)]
*  Jr., obviously President Trump, no labels, Jill Stein, everybody. There's nobody that, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6058.56s)]
*  as far as I know, that didn't face some kind of a lawsuit to try to challenge their actual [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6068.0s)]
*  ballot access, the ability for an American to turn up and exercise their own sacred, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6074.8s)]
*  individual sovereignty of thought and choose whether or not to vote for them. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6081.04s)]
*  Every single one of them was attacked in court to get their name off of a ballot. It's like, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6085.12s)]
*  we believe in democracy. You can vote for anyone as long as it's me. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6091.28s)]
*  And I believe that anyone who I knew growing up and hopefully any American that I didn't know [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6096.5599999999995s)]
*  growing up, when they see it with the in-group, out-group coding stripped away, would all, I mean, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6107.28s)]
*  would all choose the same outcome here. I think the challenge is that, you know, we are [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6118.16s)]
*  evolutionarily designed to retain the approval of our group. When you're walking across the [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6128.16s)]
*  early savannah and your group shuns you, you're out of luck, right? It's a lot harder to survive. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6139.5199999999995s)]
*  And there's a study that DARPA did around news, you know, reading news where they [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6147.2s)]
*  expected the frontal lobe to light up because you were assessing the logic of what you were reading. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6159.12s)]
*  And actually it lights up second after this area over the ear, which is if you hold up a shirt [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6166.24s)]
*  and think about whether your friends would make fun of you if you wore it. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6174.080000000001s)]
*  So, you know, you are using your analytical mind, but only after you've already decided whether [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6180.88s)]
*  you're using it to poke holes or, you know, to reinforce. And I think that, honestly, my friends [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6186.400000000001s)]
*  who don't support President Trump, I think that's why. I think, you know, there's- [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6193.200000000001s)]
*  Of course it is. I guess everything you've said is true and for the third time, nicely put. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6196.96s)]
*  But I also have a little more difficulty giving that group a pass because that's our leadership [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6203.6s)]
*  class raised and to some extent, to be brutally honest, bred to rule. And every society has that [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6209.84s)]
*  class and that's fine with me. I think it's inevitable. It's part of the human ordering. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6218.240000000001s)]
*  But that class should be able to think critically and rationally. That's their job. And they're not. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6223.120000000001s)]
*  And I just don't understand how this happened. A total breakdown in the sort of mental faculties [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6230.16s)]
*  of the people who run everything. Like, what the hell? Yeah. I mean, part of it, I think, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6237.28s)]
*  is this intentional addictive, hypnotic quality of media and social media that has really [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6241.68s)]
*  intentionally been designed that way. You know, Callie Means talks about how the tobacco companies [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6250.32s)]
*  bought, you know, the food companies and sent over their chemists and made them, you know, [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6254.88s)]
*  intentionally addictive. And that is horrifying and true. I feel that the same has really been [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6259.12s)]
*  done to our information ecosystem. And part of it is for, you know, for corporate profit and part of [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6266.4s)]
*  it is for political control. And as that media environment has also become more global, and these [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6275.599999999999s)]
*  partnerships with, you know, other parties in other countries assist in censorship. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6284.24s)]
*  I think it's difficult to think critically without a single input telling you that [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6291.5199999999995s)]
*  you're living in the Truman Show. That's right. You know? And I mean, the agency, they used to [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6300.96s)]
*  have these things called Red Teams, right? Where they would in the 80s, they started putting people [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6306.719999999999s)]
*  in, analysts in kind of a bunker for three months or six months that looked for all the world like [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6312.56s)]
*  you were living in Soviet, in the Soviet Union. And all of the books that you had available were [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6321.76s)]
*  all the things that you would be reading if you were military or leadership class there. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6327.04s)]
*  And you're listening to live radio broadcasts in, you know, Russian and just living the life of [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6332.400000000001s)]
*  a Soviet leader in the bunker and every day you're writing what you would do. You know, today I would [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6340.240000000001s)]
*  push on the Berlin Wall, etc. And that is actually one of the things that came out of it was when [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6348.8s)]
*  there was a suggestion of the timing for when Reagan should push on bringing down the wall. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6354.72s)]
*  But it allowed people to really channel their adversary to such a degree that [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6362.24s)]
*  they were viewed with a lot of suspicion when they came out. It was like, well, now you've [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6370.16s)]
*  gone native, you know, now like you, maybe you're the enemy now. And after 9-11, they started [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6375.28s)]
*  ramping these things back up around Islamic extremism and reading, you know, all of the [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6384.56s)]
*  old academic writings of, you know, some of the more violent shihad leaders and so on. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6394.080000000001s)]
*  And that suspicion remained as the better you performed in there in terms of really being able [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6401.6s)]
*  to get into somebody's mind, the more suspicious people were of you when you left and you were [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6407.76s)]
*  generally put on some kind of like a teaching assignment or somewhere you couldn't really do [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6412.32s)]
*  any harm. And I tell that story because it's very interesting to me that it's like a tacit acknowledgement [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6418.32s)]
*  that you are what you read, you are what you're immersed in, right? And you can have been, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6427.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, this 1980s Cold War, you're so much so that you're working, you know, [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6435.4400000000005s)]
*  as an analyst in Russia House at CIA, presumably you're like pretty dyed in the wool, you know, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6441.76s)]
*  blue team. And then you do this three months or you do this six months, and it is so convincing [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6449.52s)]
*  this immersion in the thoughts and radio and books and, you know, beliefs of your adversary. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6456.240000000001s)]
*  That you might just be lost forever when you come out, right? Like you might have just had [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6464.72s)]
*  a full conversion experience. I think that is what's happening. I mean, I think that media [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6468.56s)]
*  approach is now the experiment that's running all around us all the time. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6475.6s)]
*  Yes, I agree with that. It's such a terrifying effect. I wish we had more time. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6481.04s)]
*  There's always more time, all in God's time. But this was so nice to stop and actually talk about [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6488.32s)]
*  some of the real challenges that, you know, I think sometimes in the final weeks of the campaign, [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6496.24s)]
*  everything becomes about, you know, the day's polls or, you know, whatever the media opportunity [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6504.799999999999s)]
*  of the day was. And in the end, this is what's at stake. I mean, we're talking about decisions over [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6512.88s)]
*  the very constitutional ideals of this country was built on the physical safety of our communities, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6521.76s)]
*  of our families. I mean, you are putting, it's really one of the only times that as a parent, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6528.64s)]
*  you are putting the lives of your children in the hands of someone who frankly is a stranger [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6537.2s)]
*  to you. And, you know, when you look at these EMP scenarios, and then you look at these censorship [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6544.8s)]
*  scenarios, you know, the well-being of our constitution, of our children, and of human [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6553.04s)]
*  freedom is at stake here. And, you know, if it weren't, I wouldn't be fighting for it so hard. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6561.68s)]
*  But thank you for taking the time to really dig in to those issues rather than, you know, [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6569.92s)]
*  the latest photo op of the day. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6578.0s)]
*  You're welcome back anytime. Thank you, Amaryllis Kennedy. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xnvaHlcaL4&t=6580.96s)]
