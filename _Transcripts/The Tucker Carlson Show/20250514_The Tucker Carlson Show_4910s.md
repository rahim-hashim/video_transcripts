# Ed Martin on Dan Bongino vs. the DOJ, and Republicans in Congress Secretly Plotting Against Trump
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs)
*  This woman came up to me screeching in a way, I mean she can't know me, she didn't know me, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=0.0s)]
*  I never met her. Screeching, screeching, screeching, swearing and then spitting. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=4.64s)]
*  That suggests that your mere physical presence evokes an emotional response. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=8.56s)]
*  DOJ is a bigger mess even than some conspiracy minded people on the outside like me imagine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=14.64s)]
*  Some people that say, what's Dan doing Bungie? He's going hammer and tongs at this stuff right [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=19.76s)]
*  here. The scope is bigger and it is therefore much, much worse than people think. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=23.68s)]
*  Why would Tom Tillis be the instrument of your destruction? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=28.72s)]
*  He railed on J6. He said how could you represent J6 people? How stupid do people have to be to go [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  into the Capitol and blah blah blah? The Republican party tells you they're [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=38.8s)]
*  one thing but they're actually another thing. Right now it's Trump's party, it's just that some [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=41.92s)]
*  of the elites don't want to let go. Exactly. You want your kid to go to Georgetown, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=45.36s)]
*  oh he goes to Georgetown. It's way worse than that, people just have no idea. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=48.64s)]
*  The CIA small arms training facility was on their campus. It's an arm of the deepest of the deep [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=52.480000000000004s)]
*  state. Way worse than Harvard actually I think. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=58.0s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. So, I'm laughing. I saw a very angry young woman spit in your face [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=80.8s)]
*  on camera two days ago. That suggests that your mere physical presence evokes an emotional response. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=87.92s)]
*  Why? DC is in trouble and from there I can vouch for that. You are going to fix it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=99.92s)]
*  What exactly do you think from your perspective was the resistance to you? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=106.72s)]
*  Well first I'd like to point out Tucker because I've been accused of having a signature piece [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=111.44s)]
*  of clothing now like in the old days the bow tie. You know the jacket that I wear, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=115.84s)]
*  the sort of raincoat? The New York Times called it my signature. It was very effective because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=119.92s)]
*  the spit went on the raincoat. It was able to be cleaned up. It's very old school water date by the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=124.88000000000001s)]
*  way. Colombo. I'm going Colombo not as my kids said Inspector Gadget. I thought that was degrading [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=129.44s)]
*  and I've indicted all three of the four of them now. All right so look I did the job. President [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=134.56s)]
*  Trump gave me this incredible privilege. Usually a U.S. attorney is nominated and then they get [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=140.8s)]
*  confirmed and then they come into office right? So it's usually like October and you finally get [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=147.68s)]
*  somebody in office and that whole time you have the Sally Yates problem. Remember Sally Yates who [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=152.24s)]
*  was acting. He had some acting person that's either undermining you or is not totally into the job. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  Exactly. Okay so I said to the president a while ago if you want me to do this job can I have it [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  on day one and he agreed and he put me on day one and so day one we started swinging right away at [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=167.04s)]
*  all the things that we needed to swing at right? First of all day one we had the pardons, 1600 pardons. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  Day two or three we had two pardons of cops. Day three or four we had all the face act pardons. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=178.0s)]
*  It's a busy first week but more importantly as we were talking about affair I started swinging. We [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=183.28s)]
*  started actually going for it. We said okay we're going to weaponization you know Chuck Schumer's a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  bully and we went at this fight hammer and tongs and everybody noticed. Everybody noticed. Chuck [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=193.92s)]
*  Schumer noticed. Dick Durbin starts firing off letters of complaint all kinds of things and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  that's how you're supposed to do the job. I wish it was consistent with the president's mandate [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=204.72s)]
*  since he was just elected by the majority of voters. Exactly. Right it's called democracy. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=209.44s)]
*  It's called democracy and he actually put some you know he put he signed orders he signed what he [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=213.04s)]
*  gave us the direction he wanted us to do executive orders said stop the weaponization go look at [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=219.2s)]
*  this and then by the way attorney general bondi got in she gave us an even more specific list [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=223.52s)]
*  right so but more importantly tucker if if it was a hundred years ago maybe you could just be genteel [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=227.36s)]
*  and prosecute the cases as they came along right you could sit around and say sooner or later it'll [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  all work out it's not a hundred years ago and the fight right now is a fight over everything from [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  information to accountability to healing right so that's the fight and the u.s attorney is on [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  the front lines in washington dc when they're going after elon musk or judge bozberg they went [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=252.4s)]
*  after both and i gave both of them a letter that said hey i got your back if you even threaten [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=258.16s)]
*  these people in a way that goes over the line we're gonna we're gonna uh indict you so at the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=262.88s)]
*  mob threatening with physical violence they mob the mob threatened elon and the doge guys the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=266.72s)]
*  mob threatened my prosecutors the mob threatened bozberg and i said any of these things we're going [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=270.48s)]
*  to put a stop to it so but what happens is i'm i don't i've not been able to try this out i'll [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=275.6s)]
*  try to see if you like it the schumer smear schumer was so mad that i got into office and i [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=280.72s)]
*  said hold on a second you're not allowed to say the whirlwind is coming for gorsuch and uh cavanaugh [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=285.76000000000005s)]
*  and then a month later cavanaugh's got a guy with zip ties and a gun remember this this is this is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=291.68s)]
*  very well and so i said hold on the statute of limitations is coming five years i'm going to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=295.6s)]
*  investigate this and i'm going to ask chuck schumer what did you mean you cannot mean that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  you're allowed to stand and threaten justices right and so i put that out he refused to answer [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=305.36s)]
*  he said it's offensive all that stuff and then he went on a you know a jihad inside the senate [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=310.64s)]
*  he got opposition research and he went member to member and said this guy martin you can't vote [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  for him this guy martin you can't and so it's the schumer smear then they call me names in the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  washington post uh you know the washington post spid something they've never done before tucker [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  underneath the head the the line spencer hassu he put a thing that said if you have any tips on [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=329.44s)]
*  martin send them to us they've never done this before this like we want to get martin send us [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=334.4s)]
*  the tips i sent i sent a letter to bezos i said hey i'm not sure this is how the newspaper is [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  supposed to run he hasn't responded yet but my point is president trump said fight for the future [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=343.76s)]
*  of the country and that fight can't be trapped in the article three gentility of a hundred years ago [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  it's the fight we got right now and that's what we're doing so i think they hated me and this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  woman came up to me screeching in a way i mean she can't know me she didn't know me i never met [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=361.28s)]
*  her screeching screeching screeching swearing and then spitting you know i don't know i just uh who [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  was she what happened to her well they've identified her and i guess they've they've uh i don't know if [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  they've picked her up yet but they know exactly who it is and all that and so as you might imagine [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  i'm not involved in the case because you know i'm the victim in this case so that's got to be [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=379.76s)]
*  processed but i think that you know marshals and fbi were right on it and they they've got to figure [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  it out so you think the genesis of the opposition was your request to chuck schumer that he answer [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  questions about encouraging violence against the supreme court justice well i think that i the role [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=394.56s)]
*  i am played was is epitomized by that right public and willing to fight for the right things [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=399.76s)]
*  and schumer certainly took it took it to heart and made a big deal out of and then they just made me [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=408.47999999999996s)]
*  into somebody who's the washington post had me on the front page of a1 or b1 every day for three or [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=412.79999999999995s)]
*  four weeks like that wild a u.s attorney dick durbin sent me 561 questions district court [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=418.8s)]
*  judges don't get that many you know no u.s attorney's ever gotten that many question after [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=426.24s)]
*  question accusing me of this and that and the other thing so they obviously knew uh they didn't [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=430.32s)]
*  like something about what i was doing and the public picks up on it right and they worried what [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=435.2s)]
*  you would do well that's i think that's fair so um the u.s attorney needs senate confirmation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  um democrats control the senate by a huge margin is that correct that's something like that yeah [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=446.24s)]
*  oh no that's not true yeah no no that's that's not quite true no look i would have won on the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  floor but the judiciary committee tillis tillis tom tillis decided to block it in the judiciary [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=456.0s)]
*  committee democrat from california yeah well something like that oh no republican from north [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=460.88s)]
*  carolina right right so why would tom tillis um who was elected in maybe 2012 14 something like [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=464.56s)]
*  that ish um but a lot of money spent on that campaign a lot of republicans mobilized and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=474.64s)]
*  get that guy elected in a swing state even then and you know a lot of hope residing in tom tillis [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=480.4s)]
*  why would tom tillis be the instrument of your destruction well look i think um you know i gotta [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=485.91999999999996s)]
*  say uh the senate's got a process respect the process all that stuff right so check the box i [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=492.64s)]

*  decade i've done work when phyllis schlafly the late phyllis schlafly from whom i worked one of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=502.96s)]
*  the things she cared a lot about was patents and protecting individual patent holders and inventors [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  so for years we've had patent events one of the participants in the patent events is tom tillis [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=512.16s)]
*  all the time because he's good on that issue and we would work with him so not a stranger in terms [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=517.6s)]
*  of policy stuff to me so when i met with him 90 minutes he he railed on j6 he said how could you [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=522.24s)]
*  represent j6 people how can how stupid do people have to be to go into the capital and blah blah [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=530.0s)]
*  and i said sir you know look i've looked at this closely it feels like you're not quite paying [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=535.44s)]
*  attention to what happened right and and that's correct yeah and look here's the thing you know [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=540.72s)]
*  tucker this is what i mean by this is the fight we're in um this fight for the future of our [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=544.96s)]
*  country millions of americans are fall victim to the hoaxes one after another yes and if you fall [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=548.96s)]
*  victim to the j6 hoax that it was an insurrection armed and this close to the end then you might act [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=555.92s)]
*  like tom tillis and you might rant and rave and say things like that and that's what he did [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=562.56s)]
*  but if you're i think if you're not under the spell of the hoax you say [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=567.04s)]
*  wait a second lots of people were waved into the capital and maybe you could charge them with [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=571.4399999999999s)]
*  trespass but you can't throw them in jail for three years four years three and a half years right [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  because of and then the supreme court bipartisan supreme court throws out the charge that was used [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=580.24s)]

*  you know like the other thing they all said to me is oh you must like people that hit cops because [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=795.9200000000001s)]

*  the worst always that's the system people who've been charged with crimes right exactly isn't that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=808.96s)]
*  the way it works isn't that the way it works but i said so i say look nobody's for hitting cops [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=813.36s)]

*  we're i'm past it now except to say this the weaponization of government against the people [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  is what we see over and over and over again and when the leaders either acquiesce to it or fall [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=873.1999999999999s)]
*  for the hoax of it we see it over and over and over again whether you pick a fiza cord you know [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=880.1600000000001s)]
*  we just watch this over and over and you don't have time to say was your was your heart in it [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=887.2800000000001s)]
*  was your intent are you lying it's just you're willing to buy into that worldview it's destroying [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=891.76s)]
*  the country can i ask you one that i couldn't agree more can i ask one last question did any [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=896.48s)]
*  member of the u.s center member congress suggests like how many federal agents were in the crowd [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=900.48s)]
*  that day they none of them seem interested in that yeah that seems like a baseline question [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=907.76s)]
*  did any members of the senate i mean in my in my um probably not in the conversations i had but [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=913.76s)]
*  i but you bring us to does anyone care well you bring us to a point where as i started this out is [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=919.04s)]
*  we're in a fight for about information right and we're told get over to move on it's like the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=926.3199999999999s)]
*  2020 election yeah the people say to me that they say i was a stop the steal organizer well [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=933.68s)]
*  i ran the election board in st louis back in st louis you know i ran the election board i know [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=938.8s)]
*  how elections work the 2020 election there were lots of things that were really off base that's [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=942.64s)]
*  why i've always said it i maintained today doesn't mean i haven't proved that doesn't mean that i've [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=946.56s)]
*  proven the election was stolen no but i know there's things that were off well you weren't [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=950.2399999999999s)]
*  allowed to say that remember you're not even allowed to say that out loud and you go forward [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=953.3599999999999s)]
*  and so they say oh you were stopped to steal so i said wait isn't that the system we're supposed [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=957.76s)]
*  to have like to and we we keep seeing information government weaponized to stop information flow [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=961.68s)]
*  and most of us move on right you move on to the next thing because the way the world is moving and [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=969.3599999999999s)]
*  one of the things this effort to do to focus on weaponization is is to get the truth out [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=975.5999999999999s)]
*  so to your point we still don't know the answer to that we do not know how many ages how can we not [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=980.0s)]
*  know i mean i'm going to i'm going to get it out or i'm going to die trying pipe bomber as a [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=985.1999999999999s)]
*  prosecutor i've got the pipe bomber case in my office the fbi bongino said the fbi change all the [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=989.68s)]
*  agents everybody look at it again it's been going on for about five weeks it's like uh keystone cops [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=997.04s)]
*  you know they didn't interview some of the people that were that you would have said uh that might [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1003.5999999999999s)]
*  be a suspect they hadn't interviewed him i mean so the question becomes what's happening here is it [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1007.5999999999999s)]
*  incompetence it feels worse than incompetence right and so um that information it does it does [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1013.04s)]
*  what do you think well i think um i think it's worse than incompetence and and i think um but [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1018.96s)]
*  i think the only way forward is to not describe what i think of the motives but to expose over [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1026.32s)]
*  and over again what's happened if you expose what's happened and the truth gets out then [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1032.72s)]
*  accountability is possible if you don't expose what's happened the accountability looks like [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1037.2s)]
*  targeting right so you got to do this one to get to this one and the other side just does this and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  then they count on the media to tell us it's okay we have to do this and this and um that's my answer [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1046.56s)]
*  to some people that say what's dan doing bunch you know i talk to him every week or so he's going [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1052.08s)]
*  hammer and tongs at this stuff right here you can't arrest everybody the first month but you got to [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1056.8s)]
*  get this going and it's a challenge but i'm glad people are holding us you know pushing everybody [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1062.08s)]
*  it's good but it's uh it's harder than it looks it really is i believe that my informed well-informed [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1066.0s)]
*  sense is that doj is a bigger mess even than some conspiracy minded people on the outside like me [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1072.96s)]
*  imagine it is like i think it's actually a mess is it uh i would say that look i work specifically [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1078.64s)]
*  yeah look i worked for the the catholic church right i worked for the catholic church i'm pretty [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1084.32s)]
*  attuned to bureaucracies right and i've seen this seen the scope of them and and see the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1089.52s)]
*  institutional inertia like the momentum that they get and i think um my office was this in my u.s [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1093.92s)]
*  attorney's office was about this big tucker and it took me 120 days to get this much of my arms [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1100.24s)]
*  you know wrapped around this much because this is how big it was you know cash's job is this big and [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1106.8s)]
*  doj's is this big and the presence is so big yeah so my answer is the scope is bigger and uh and it [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1112.24s)]
*  is therefore much much worse than people think and i i just think it's a it's a and by the way one of [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1118.8s)]
*  the reasons i say information is so key you can't we can't win the article three battle fast enough [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1126.56s)]
*  we can fight it and we can eventually win lots of them you can't win it fast enough [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1134.96s)]
*  to get the progress we need in terms of our so you've got to be doing the information for [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1139.04s)]
*  people watching what's the article three means like the federal courts we're in federal courts [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1143.6799999999998s)]
*  the president says you you can't let people come into the country and then the courts say [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1147.12s)]
*  nationwide injunction and you know you're not allowed to do that and you're you're constantly [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1151.2s)]

*  take a longer time than just getting the word out right getting the information out i just i feel [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1180.16s)]
*  like it's a different moment in history and that's that's how i was u.s attorney that's why you saw [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1185.68s)]
*  people saw so much out facing action because i wasn't just looking at courts i was looking at [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1190.48s)]
*  making an argument for the public so they could see the policies america has thousands of colleges [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1197.2s)]

*  has always been that way it's just better than the other one and and the question is right well it's [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1454.88s)]
*  better in some way i mean i've never you know i don't vote democrats because i'm pro-life so [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1459.1200000000001s)]

*  republican voters who feel that way right so the democratic party is off the table for me but i'm [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1466.24s)]
*  not sure the republican party is better because i think it's more deceptive democratic party's [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1470.64s)]
*  yeah we're the trainee illegal alien party okay that's who you are i find that repugnant but [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1476.6399999999999s)]
*  the republican party tells you they're one thing but they're actually another thing that's what [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1482.3999999999999s)]
*  bothers me well no i thought yeah well it's the same thing phil has talked about you know back [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1486.96s)]
*  in the day it was the establishment on the eastern establishment eastern elites who were trying to [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1491.04s)]
*  control the party and did a lot uh look right now it's trump's party it's just that some of the [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1494.48s)]
*  elites don't want to let go right exactly and so the question is will they be able to hold on and [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1498.3999999999999s)]
*  when you heard the president say he didn't say ed wouldn't get confirmed he said that's not worth [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1502.64s)]
*  the fight right now we got other things to do and you know we knew we knew we'd get somebody good in [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1507.44s)]
*  that spot to your point um and we knew there's a place for me to play a role so you know i i but [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  the republican party is trump's party it's just some people aren't ready for it so it's really [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1517.2s)]
*  it's not left versus right moderate versus conservative populist versus globalist it's [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1521.44s)]
*  really reform versus corrupt i mean i think there's massive corruption in the u.s government in our [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1526.5600000000002s)]
*  system yeah more broadly trump was elected on the promise of cleaning it up you were his instrument [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1531.76s)]
*  to do that so i think it's fair to say people who oppose that are against reform well i if i can i'd [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1536.96s)]
*  say two things about it one thing i think as we you've talked about before in lots of issues [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1543.76s)]
*  president trump represents a different view of america first is the way it's characterized but [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1548.4s)]
*  this notion of of believing in ourselves our citizens more than other things including wars [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1552.8s)]
*  and globalists and all that i think that i think that's a big pivot and and people feel that as [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1558.96s)]
*  voters obviously did but i will agree with you on this um the corruption is not one party i mean [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1562.96s)]
*  trust me i'm the prosecutor oh i know it's not one party you know that but i'm your viewers it's not [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1567.92s)]
*  one party um when you see uh 6.7 billion dollars transferred from the epa to an organization set up [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1572.56s)]
*  uh a year before set up by the same leftist left-leaning democrat supporting folks that ran the [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1580.0s)]
*  housing tax credit boondoggle from the 90s it's the same people 6.7 billion when you see that [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1586.72s)]
*  transfer of money it's this is this is not one party that both parties are at the trough and [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1592.48s)]
*  the question is who gives us the best chance to try to take uh to take this country back and to [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1598.48s)]
*  fight for it and it's it's clearly been trump uh but it's a everyday battle and uh and what are [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  the republican senators opposed to your nomination well it's funny as soon as uh tillis blocked it [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1607.76s)]
*  then a guy like senator cornyn said i'm for him you know we weren't sure until then uh and then [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1612.88s)]
*  i think collin said i'm looking at it i'm thinking about it so i will say that all like collin says [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1619.92s)]

*  other way they're allowing chaos in the in this state her brother is benefiting right yeah it's [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1676.08s)]
*  probably the most corrupt state outside of new jersey uh out of 50 um so but were there any other [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1681.6000000000001s)]

*  a hard no at the beginning but at that level in that process they're all playing a game right [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1698.0s)]
*  until they have to look senator holly i'm from missouri senator holly said if you get to the [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1703.04s)]
*  floor you'll you'll you'll definitely get the votes afraid to vote against you right and but [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1708.08s)]

*  was uh senator tillis was taking one for the team if he was you know killing me to help other people [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1717.36s)]
*  or what but um he was the obvious one that decided the extent you know what do you think the real [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1722.72s)]
*  issue was why wouldn't republican senators form uh you know a blue line in support of you like [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1728.24s)]
*  what what was it that made them you know i 9 11 you said i mean rather 9 11 uh january 6th i would [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1735.04s)]
*  say um that a number of times it was clear that i was not going to be sort of controllable that i [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1744.16s)]
*  was going to do exactly what i thought and what the president let me loose to do and i think that [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1753.52s)]
*  that's for the for the you know the sort of ruling class that's the wildest of wild cards and uh so [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1759.6000000000001s)]
*  a prosecutor who's willing to do the not controlled by corrupt interests yeah that's the scariest [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1767.3600000000001s)]
*  thing there is right so you know um yeah i but i don't really know i mean i you know i would have [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1772.96s)]
*  bet that i would have gotten through because president trump wanted me um so you know it's [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1778.0s)]
*  it's hard to know i thought some of the other guys that got confirmed had a lot more checkered [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1783.3600000000001s)]
*  past but i don't you know it's not about that yeah of course it's it's never the liars who get in [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1788.0s)]
*  trouble it's the truth tellers who are the threat of course maybe for sure okay for sure they don't [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1793.2s)]
*  care if you lie they lie they love lies um their father is the father of lies but uh you are staying [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1800.16s)]

*  like a da it's a great da office and then a huge u.s attorney's office with cases all over the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1825.28s)]
*  world and all sorts of complicated interesting stuff and a huge docket i can get to all usaid [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1829.92s)]
*  all the usaid falls within us so when you see the fraud that's going on in europe and and you know [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1835.68s)]
*  this is all stuff that the u.s attorney and trust me the u.s attorney is already looking at it and [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1840.72s)]
*  you can look at this stuff and say because of the jurisdiction so but it's a big office with a lot [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1845.2s)]
*  of bureaucracy and so what i basically my new job is focused on weaponization the docket is the whole [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=1849.6000000000001s)]

*  tell you about this is important because it's you're going to see it nationwide this summer [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2595.04s)]
*  and that's the problem of juveniles in all these cities where you have democrats and liberals in [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2598.48s)]
*  charge they're soft on juveniles so the juveniles get away with crimes and tougher and tougher [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2603.2799999999997s)]
*  harder and harder carjackings carjackings you know and worse and so if that's the system it's [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2608.64s)]
*  happened over and over now and the and of course the community that they are in has a lot of you [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2615.04s)]
*  know the schools are bad they're not a lot of role models right life is not in a good spot and you [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2619.6s)]
*  churn this you've got this situation i said to someone there was a incident down at the navy [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2624.08s)]
*  pier a navy yard where someone was a bunch of kids juveniles come in these gangs and they and they [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2628.56s)]
*  steal wallets and they get around people and i said to a friend of mine he said oh yeah the navy [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2633.92s)]
*  pier is like that and i said what are you talking about it's navy yard he said the same thing happens [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2638.0s)]
*  in chicago in other words every urban city has this problem of juveniles and the reason why is [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2641.12s)]
*  because we continue to send them back and to keep them in this system that's just so broken but you [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2645.6s)]
*  can't shoot them when they come up to you and do this no no of course that's right exactly no it's [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2650.4s)]
*  a disaster you can't defend yourself right it's a disaster but i think one of the things that that [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2654.0s)]
*  juvenile question is one that dc has to face because it's really and the older kids if if it [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2658.16s)]
*  were if they were girls they'd be calling it trafficking because the older boys are trafficking [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2662.96s)]
*  the younger boys because they know they won't get into trouble the same way because they're [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2667.84s)]
*  underage so that part of it is a disaster and that falls right on the dc city council and the mayor [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2671.76s)]
*  and and the current uh uh administration there that hasn't hasn't taken it seriously because [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2677.6000000000004s)]
*  you just need to lock them up you get and you need to get them out of dc put them in some place you [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2683.1200000000003s)]
*  could pay to put them in another you know reform school or whatever to get them out of town instead [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2687.04s)]
*  they let them they let them loose they they don't just could fix that in a day because they have [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2690.96s)]
*  constitutional authority over the district if they wanted to and newt for whatever you think [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2696.4s)]
*  in newt gingrich when he took over in 94 he took over dc and and made it a much better city and [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2700.56s)]
*  created this massive renaissance right that's right why do you why do you think they don't like i mean [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2704.64s)]

*  president i think is frustrated by uh the dynamic i think he wishes that there was more action in [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2713.92s)]
*  terms of taking it over but that's not been a priority yeah no i mean i think it's fair [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2718.64s)]

*  question i asked before because i think it's interesting why so people who are for gun control [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2812.16s)]
*  tell us that guns are dangerous and bad okay and i disagree i think guns are a tool they can be [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2817.68s)]
*  misused whatever like a chainsaw or a steak knife but there's those exact same people don't seem [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2822.32s)]
*  as concerned when guns are used in crimes they're only concerned when guns are like [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2829.76s)]
*  under your bed or in your gun safe they're concerned when law-abiding people have guns [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2836.0800000000004s)]
*  not when criminals have guns what is that well i mean part of me wants to engage in some [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2839.92s)]
*  philosophical argument with you about what they think but i mostly think it's what you said earlier [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2848.5600000000004s)]
*  they don't this is a trend that you noticed yeah they don't really care about these people i mean [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2853.6000000000004s)]
*  i'm the republican i'm the conservative i'm supposed to not care they say you don't care [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2857.44s)]
*  about these people when i get in this job i look at and say poor people mostly black and brown are [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2861.12s)]
*  living through hell because of the policies that you have which is to let bad guys go with guns you [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2866.56s)]
*  and i both would agree if you're a bad if you do something with a gun badly you know you're then [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2872.32s)]
*  you should be incarcerated definitely no problem because guns can kill you quickly it's going to [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2876.56s)]
*  so i wish i could say it was a philosophical thing it's that they really don't care about these [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2881.36s)]
*  people they don't mind letting the people suffer and letting their communities you know get get [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2886.08s)]
*  destroyed and the rest of it is just window dressing i there's no other trying to read [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2891.2799999999997s)]
*  people's minds it doesn't work dc is the only significant city that republicans could really [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2895.7599999999998s)]
*  run through the congress and correct the u.s attorney's job so i i feel like the only shot [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2900.48s)]
*  the city has at reform and in the last 50 years since it's had it on rule the only time it's [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2905.6s)]
*  gotten better is when republicans take control and so i just like you to fill out a little bit [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2909.52s)]
*  now you're leaving but what do you think should happen from the u.s attorney's office in dc [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2916.32s)]
*  in dc well we started on guns and then we're going to switch we're going to switch keeps [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2920.08s)]
*  moving towards other violent crime now the key pivot in this again is down the weeds a little [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2924.16s)]
*  bit is to take these gun crimes and then down to rape and assault and go down even to property [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2928.16s)]
*  crimes because you can't have cvs have everything behind lock and key right but the two things that [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2933.44s)]
*  we're doing is dragging these cases to federal court because the local court is so bad the juries [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2938.08s)]
*  are bad the judges are bad the system is bad so you get them to federal court you got a better [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2943.28s)]
*  chance to have real penalties and a bit more stability but the problem really is going to be [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2947.0400000000004s)]
*  whether you can have the will of the judges to hold these people to the laws right and to put [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2952.0s)]
*  them away but that you move along that continuum every single day on in terms of addressing crime [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2957.44s)]
*  the last thing i'd say is that a lot of talk about money you know the mayor wants to do a build a [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2962.6400000000003s)]
*  stadium and all these things well they need more cops and cops cost money but cops also require [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2967.2000000000003s)]
*  that you be on their side right you remember when we were kids being an fbi agent was a big deal [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2972.08s)]
*  being a cop was a big deal for sure and now young people don't feel drawn to those jobs right so [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2976.08s)]
*  it is hard to get cops mpd is down probably i think the ideal is 3800 cops there about 3300 [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2981.92s)]
*  you can say you're going to get all these crimes you still got to go get cops and you got to find [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2988.7999999999997s)]
*  a way to get people into the system that can be on the streets and doing it so if you give me my [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2992.16s)]
*  wish list for dc to make it better in the next two or three years it's continue to actually take [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=2997.44s)]
*  real crimes and put them in federal court and then bolster the number of cops and you could [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3003.52s)]
*  bolster the number of cops as u.s attorney just by having their back right there's something called [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3008.08s)]
*  the lewis list which is what happens if you go to court and you're a cop and somebody claims you lied [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3012.8s)]
*  they can put you on what's called a lewis list which is a requirement that the prosecutors [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3017.92s)]
*  tell a defendant that this guy testifying has had a problem in the past of credibility but it's abused [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3022.16s)]
*  by the the judges and the and the and the public defenders to hurt the cops well i i said we're [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3028.48s)]
*  going to stick up for the cops and we're going to try to change that so you got to stick up for the [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3034.24s)]
*  cops in lots of concrete ways that make the system work but but you've mostly just got to get after [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3037.92s)]
*  the crime every in systematically not hard you know rudy and these famous prosecutors they they [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3043.6s)]
*  did one thing well they consistently prosecuted crime they didn't come up with social plans they [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3049.6s)]
*  didn't come just get a crime put him in jail get a crime put in certain punishment you know metro [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3055.44s)]
*  just changed their rules in the city in the district the metro uh you know uh both the buses [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3061.44s)]
*  and the metro the trains that you can get banned from the trains because once you get banned from [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3066.16s)]
*  the trains or banned from metro i can then arrest you for a different charge could be a felony for [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3071.2799999999997s)]
*  coming back in on a ban between before between before that you could go every day you could do [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3075.92s)]
*  three felonies three misdemeanors a day you could expose yourself in the morning jump a fair thing [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3080.96s)]
*  in the afternoon and and you know whatever and so metro got serious and they're changing the [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3085.28s)]
*  dynamic that's just plain getting the crimes down and focused on it and but you got to want to do [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3089.84s)]
*  it you got to want to do it every day well you have to care care well that's the word the same [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3094.88s)]
*  yeah um so what what other cold cases are you looking at well the big one that i was interested [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3100.08s)]
*  in is the is the uh the number of times you can take dna uh that was left behind those are a lot [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3106.24s)]
*  of sexual assault rape and sex sexual assault so those are the most obvious ones there's some dna [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3112.08s)]
*  cases on guns if you have a if a weapon on a crime has some dna on it as the technology's got more [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3117.04s)]
*  sophisticated but you can instantly go and and and using the databases now and technology get a [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3122.56s)]
*  check on a dna from a lot of why has no one done that well they are it's just it's a process it [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3128.24s)]
*  takes a lot of uh it takes a lot of time i mean one of the things you're doing is not everybody's [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3132.8799999999997s)]
*  in the database so you're trying to track back through but we are doing it i mean that's a lot [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3136.4799999999996s)]
*  of people on the database a lot of people are in the database but not not everybody i mean and and [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3140.72s)]
*  so it one of the well and so the fbi has been good about i don't know why they were doing it [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3146.0s)]
*  weren't doing it before but the fbi has been great about letting us do it and so we're you know we're [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3150.0s)]
*  tracking that down can i ask you a question the members of congress and it wasn't just tom tillis [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3154.08s)]
*  i don't mean to keep beating up on poor tom tillis an idiot anyway but but like all members congress [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3158.3199999999997s)]
*  on both sides were they're very threatened by j6 that's one of the reasons you know is their [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3164.08s)]
*  building not the people's house that belonged to them right and they felt like their space was [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3168.4s)]
*  invaded they felt their security was jeopardized i get it but are they concerned that there are like [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3172.64s)]
*  murders taking place within walking distance of their office i mean do they care about crime in [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3178.88s)]
*  dc did anyone mention that well again you know tucker and look i think president trump is like [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3184.2400000000002s)]
*  this how he approaches everything and i mean that's how i wanted to serve and i do we did [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3189.92s)]
*  exactly what you're saying we said to everybody on the hill come to a briefing on on safety we [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3196.32s)]
*  want to keep you safe because the staffers care right the staffers are getting assaulted and all [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3200.88s)]
*  and so and people and people people came to that and people want to hear how we're going to do that [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3205.2s)]
*  how we can prosecute how because law enforcement again is partly prosecuting but it's a lot of [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3209.4399999999996s)]
*  showing up and showing force so people know you're safer uh and yeah i mean look i i think they care [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3214.96s)]
*  the question is whether it leads to policy you know and again my my job as a prosecutor in that [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  office uh is to get after the crimes as i've got them and if they're not going to adjust their [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3227.04s)]
*  policies that i can't worry about that on the days you know day to day of getting after crime [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3232.16s)]
*  but um i'll tell you what when i go to you know anacostia or i go to these neighborhoods they care [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3237.52s)]
*  and they know the u.s attorney is is paying attention to that and that's probably more [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3243.2s)]
*  important than the folks up on the hill i i think i think it is tell us what you did with wikipedia [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3247.6s)]
*  and why well you know the um one of the aspects of you know weaponization is what we're talking [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3254.48s)]
*  what i've been talking about with the new the new role i've been on this weaponization working group [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3262.32s)]
*  is when weaponization of the legal system yeah weaponization of the legal system but really the [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3266.48s)]
*  weaponization weaponization of the law the use of the law to to hide and and operate so wikipedia has [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3270.2400000000002s)]
*  this incredible 501 c3 right gets a tax benefit from we the people it's a public benefit corporation [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3277.36s)]
*  you know the 1950s they looked at this closely because the rockefeller foundation the carnegie [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3283.84s)]
*  foundation had been using their foundations and abusing it and that's when the law first changed [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3288.08s)]
*  to have 501 c3 become a tax code it was part of the shift right so the the cox reporter the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3292.6400000000003s)]
*  reese committee or whatever it was but so we have this problem where these these wikipedia has all [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3298.32s)]
*  this money that they use because they're a 501 c3 a non-profit that's supposed to be for the public [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3303.44s)]
*  benefit do they how much how much do they pay you're in taxes i don't even know i don't know [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3309.36s)]
*  the numbers this is no they pay no taxes i'm not sure if they pay zero but they probably say they [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3313.36s)]
*  pay payroll and other things they have an answer to that but they would be tax exempt under the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3317.52s)]
*  under the code but more importantly they're obviously biased they're obviously and they're [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3321.92s)]
*  anti-semitic is the big one but they're obviously biased in all sorts of other ways in fact as soon [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3327.36s)]
*  as i started taking them on my wikipedia page went even worse to hell you know then in terms of [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3331.28s)]
*  people coming on and editing it supposedly citizen editors so there's there's bias again [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3336.0s)]
*  information war right there's bias here that is against we the people in my opinion but certainly [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3341.52s)]
*  it's bias that's hidden from us because they're hiding behind the law in other words they're [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3347.84s)]
*  using the law in a way that is weaponized against certain groups and individuals and so that's what [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3351.92s)]
*  we basically said to to wikipedia is hey let's look closely at what you're doing and how it's [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3357.6s)]
*  operating and see who's benefiting or not benefiting and paying a price and by the way [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3362.56s)]
*  as soon as this happens they get panicked because they know we know there's another reason i wrote [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3366.88s)]
*  to a number of the medical journals and i said you guys are all 501 c3 you get big benefits from tax [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3371.36s)]
*  exempt status how are you balancing you know the partisan nature of the work you're doing how are [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3377.04s)]
*  you abiding by the laws that say that you're not supposed to be picking sides or paid for by one [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3383.2799999999997s)]
*  donor or the other and they lose their mind because no one's supposed to ask you know you're [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3388.72s)]
*  not supposed to ask like it's like usaid you we weren't supposed to ask until this last six months [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3392.9599999999996s)]
*  why are we spending 400 million dollars in wherever right why is this we're not allowed to ask so um [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3398.3999999999996s)]
*  that's a part of this weaponization thing that i think uh is underrated and with wikipedia got a [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3404.48s)]
*  huge reaction wikipedia is is history now i mean it's how people understand the past that's right [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3409.2799999999997s)]
*  it's in league with google so it's the it's the first result on everything every now and you [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3415.12s)]
*  punch in gets wikipedia first so people like don't understand anything that's happened in the world [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3420.16s)]
*  prior to last week except through wikipedia so if it's totally distorted then you change the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3425.2s)]
*  collective memory we're i know but we're back right again we started we're back to the information [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3429.68s)]
*  war right it's a war over information and if nobody you tell me who who well let me say it [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3434.4s)]
*  this way a prosecutor saying that about wikipedia is vastly different than tucker carlson saying it [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3441.52s)]
*  well i agree with that and so and that's the point i wish i was a prosecutor well right exactly and [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3446.96s)]
*  that and that's and that's why donald trump and in my estimation said to guys like me go and do [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3451.52s)]
*  this because that's the role is not just to find the right guy to prosecute we got to do that too [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3458.16s)]
*  if it if it rises to that it's to make clear how off kilter the information uh battle is [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3463.68s)]
*  because the public doesn't know that right they don't have that sense of what's wrong i mean [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3470.96s)]
*  wikipedia is a propaganda operation and one of its founders told me that the cia or the [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3475.84s)]
*  american intel community is heavily involved in shaping the message on wikipedia did you come [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3481.44s)]
*  across evidence of that not yet but that just started that that and that sort of uh opening [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3487.04s)]
*  salvo was about three weeks ago so judge janine will have that one on her plate but you know where [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3491.68s)]
*  i'm going the job i'm going to i don't have to leave any of that stuff behind so i can tell you [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3496.08s)]
*  i thought you were going to go a different direction and i'll i'll say on the weaponization [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3500.56s)]
*  working group as it's described by attorney general bondy and the president's direction [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3504.64s)]
*  intelligence community is one of the groups who was weaponized against the people obviously it's [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3509.6s)]
*  obvious the question is how are we going to get to the bottom of it right how are we going to get to [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3513.52s)]
*  the bottom of some of the weaponization of the government intelligence community against the [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3517.12s)]
*  citizens and that's what that's where i'm going now but we can't tell you it's classified well i [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3520.8s)]
*  think you tell me i'm now i'm now in the i'm now in the system well we'll see if i can get it you [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3525.36s)]
*  know but again the point of getting see if you can get what well the point of getting into these [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3529.52s)]
*  positions as a prosecutor is i'm now getting the the the clearances to be able to get to the to the [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3534.64s)]
*  to the level where you can look at so i know that still try not to tell you but that's the point of [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3540.88s)]
*  of uh this fight is you cannot win the information battle based on what they let you see it's what [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3545.36s)]
*  you have to find even in our government especially in our government and i and i have to say um [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3552.64s)]
*  the classification regimen does not seem primarily focused on protecting national security [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3559.36s)]
*  at all right exactly back to weaponization the 51 guys that signed the letter on the [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3567.2000000000003s)]
*  hunter biden laptop yeah it you'd have to be a fool to think that's an isolated incident [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3572.4s)]
*  in other words if they're willing to misuse and mischaracterize a letter based on their [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3579.44s)]
*  you know their status and the advantage that they have as insiders that's not the only time they [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3585.7599999999998s)]
*  did it no exactly right and so the question is how endemic is the weaponization right and we both [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3590.56s)]
*  know the answer this is back to your point it's much much worse than we think the question is how [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3596.96s)]
*  do we continually go about getting to the bottom of it i'll probably get myself in trouble you and [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3601.7599999999998s)]
*  tro who knows one of the ways i ran elections one of the places i think that is um uh really [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3607.52s)]
*  problematic that nobody has looked at is the certification of systems right the certification [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3613.28s)]
*  of election systems for the record not saying there's any fraud at what but how do you certify [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3618.32s)]
*  there's fraud well i know but the election what's at stake exactly well no no but even better look [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3623.6800000000003s)]
*  at how much money it is that's what i'm saying right well okay but even just the election [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3628.32s)]
*  assistance commission is the entity that certifies machines okay it has no real teeth but it controls [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3632.1600000000003s)]
*  who's certified or not which means it controls who has the good housekeeping stamp of approval [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3639.2s)]
*  worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars what are the chances that that has been done [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3644.3199999999997s)]
*  everything else we've seen in in government is broken corrupt messy incompetent or something [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3650.0s)]
*  right what are the chances that's the one place where it's totally competent and totally without [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3656.3999999999996s)]
*  any flaws i'm just saying let's go look right and and and that's what we've got to do to get to the [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3660.16s)]
*  bottom of this in the same way that the gun control people are fine with gang bangers having [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3664.64s)]
*  guns right the democracy is sacred people are very upset when you want to make sure that elections [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3671.2799999999997s)]
*  have integrity that's weird i love when you do this tucker move it's weird it's weird only if you [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3677.8399999999997s)]
*  impute good intentions to these people right i mean that's it is weird then no is he right it's [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3684.3199999999997s)]
*  it's totally predictable i mean of course and all around the world by the way they're watching this [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3690.7200000000003s)]
*  happen you know poland right now they're in the midst of they're trying to take poland out obama [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3694.56s)]
*  is in poland there's an election in a week of course obama's in poland i had a whistleblower [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3698.56s)]

*  of months samantha powers would arrive with usaid money to this this country i won't say which one [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3711.76s)]
*  and and i said you guys know samantha powers of course we do she was arriving with the money and [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3718.4s)]
*  she was and they knew it was a you know sort of the beginnings of a of a you know color revolution [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=3722.8s)]

*  rudimentary but they clearly were somebody knew what they were doing for the look i mean again [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LotMJAdWyOs&t=4337.2s)]
