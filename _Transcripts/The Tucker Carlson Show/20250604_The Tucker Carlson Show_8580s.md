# John Kiriakou: CIA's Secret Torture Programs, Mk-Ultra, 9-11, and Why Obama Threw Him in Jail
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU)
*  Do you think it is possible to get people to commit acts that they wouldn't otherwise commit? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=0.0s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6.72s)]
*  MKUltra caused people to jump out of windows and commit suicide. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=12.14s)]
*  You said there were a lot of shrinks at CIA. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=12.64s)]
*  I used those those shrinks on operations. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=14.74s)]
*  We even hypnotized one guy. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=17.82s)]
*  He was hypnotized with his arm in the air for two hours. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=19.82s)]
*  Would you describe the CIA as an intelligence gathering agency? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=22.54s)]
*  Not anymore. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=25.94s)]
*  It used to be until 9-11. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=26.66s)]
*  And then it became a paramilitary organization. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=29.3s)]
*  What they would rather do is fancy high-tech satellites and drones. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=31.94s)]
*  And they're not really in the business anymore of recruiting spies to steal secrets. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=36.9s)]
*  I got a call from a Japanese diplomat and he said, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=41.22s)]
*  Hey, let's have lunch. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=44.42s)]
*  I said, great. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=45.3s)]
*  He said to me, so what's next for you? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=45.94s)]
*  And I said, I think I'm going to resign soon. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=48.18s)]
*  And he says, no, if you give me information, I can give you money. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=51.22s)]
*  He was an FBI agent. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=57.14s)]
*  What? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  Trying to get me to commit actual espionage. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=59.86s)]
*  The FBI did that to you? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=63.06s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=64.9s)]
*  We got to burn the government down, actually. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=65.4s)]
*  I mean, your only crime was an ABC interview in which you say, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=67.38s)]
*  yes, the CIA does have a torture program. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=72.66s)]
*  I know because I worked there and the president authorized it and lied about it in public. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=74.5s)]
*  That's your sum total of your crimes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=78.5s)]
*  That was it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=80.34s)]
*  It's pretty unbelievable you went to jail. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=87.06s)]
*  I think when 9-11 happened, you were one of how many CIA officers at the counterterrorism [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=105.22s)]
*  center who spoke Arabic? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=111.54s)]
*  Oh, at the counterterrorism center? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=113.22s)]
*  Two? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=115.14s)]
*  Two. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=116.1s)]
*  So you have this distinguished CIA career. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=117.06s)]
*  No one outside the CIA has heard of you, but in the CIA, you're very well known, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=120.26s)]
*  helped capture an al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan risked your life as an operations officer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=125.46000000000001s)]
*  And then you leave CIA and you mention in an ABC news interview in 2007 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=135.46s)]
*  that the CIA is torturing people, which it was. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=145.38s)]
*  Illegally. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=146.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  And is a stain on the country, didn't make the country safer. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  You say that and you wind up in jail. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=151.16s)]
*  I sure did. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=154.92s)]
*  Did any of the people who were torturing other people wind up in jail? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  Not a single one. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=159.72s)]
*  The torturers? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=161.64s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm so crazy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=162.44s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=163.4s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=164.04s)]
*  The torturers didn't go to jail. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=164.76s)]
*  The people who conceived of the torture, the people who funded the torture, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=166.2s)]
*  appropriated taxpayer money for the torture, the people who implemented it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=170.2s)]
*  Nobody went to prison but me. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=175.16000000000003s)]
*  And I guess what's so funny is when you think of whistleblowers complaining about something [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=177.4s)]
*  like torture, you think of like, I don't know, some, you know, the Barragans or some, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  you know, professional peace activists. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=187.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  I was a true believer. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=190.84s)]
*  You were a CIA operations officer. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=192.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=193.8s)]
*  Doing the war on terror. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=194.52s)]
*  Specifically a counter-terrorism operations officer. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=196.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  And so you were hardly some like- [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=200.52s)]
*  No, I was no bleeding heart. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=203.4s)]
*  Now type, right. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=204.44000000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=205.4s)]
*  And you went to jail. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=206.76000000000002s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=207.88000000000002s)]
*  So can you just, just to come to the point of the story where you're out of the CIA, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=208.36s)]
*  you're working at Deloitte. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=215.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=216.44000000000003s)]
*  And you give this interview to Brian Ross at ABC. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=217.32000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=221.4s)]
*  One of the few, I think, pretty honest ABC reporters who of course left ABC. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  Agreed. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  Too much honesty for them. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=225.8s)]
*  And what happened then? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  This was, that was 2007 during the Bush. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=231.24s)]
*  Right. It was in December of 2007. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=232.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=234.6s)]
*  So I went on this interview with Brian Ross and I said three things. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=235.0s)]
*  I said that the CIA was torturing its prisoners. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=238.12s)]
*  I said that torture was official US government policy. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=240.52s)]
*  And I said that because President Bush had specifically said, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=243.32s)]
*  we do not torture. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=246.28s)]
*  I knew that wasn't true. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=248.52s)]
*  Where did he say that? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=250.52s)]
*  He said that in a press conference at the White House in December of 2007. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=251.24s)]
*  And I said that the, that the torture had been personally approved by the president, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=256.2s)]
*  which was also true. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=260.6s)]
*  And so within 24 hours, the CIA. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  How did you know that by the way? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=265.72s)]
*  Oh, because I was. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  Were you just guessing? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=268.36s)]
*  Oh, no, I was the executive assistant to the CIA's deputy director for operations. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  So I was intimately involved in the planning for all of this nonsense, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=275.08000000000004s)]
*  not just torture, but the Iraq war as well. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=280.36s)]
*  And I was watching the rule of law just be thrown to the dogs almost on a daily basis. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=284.12s)]
*  And I decided whatever Brian Ross was going to ask me, I was going to tell the truth. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=291.8s)]
*  That's what I did. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=296.2s)]
*  So that was in late 2007? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=298.04s)]
*  Late 2007, December of 2007. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=300.28000000000003s)]
*  So the president authorized this again, didn't make the country any safer. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=302.68s)]
*  No. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=308.84000000000003s)]
*  The whole thing really hurt the country, but, and then lied about it in public, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=309.08000000000004s)]
*  which you're not supposed to do. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=313.16s)]
*  I mean, let's be not supposed to do that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=314.04s)]
*  And no, you're just not supposed to. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=315.8s)]
*  You said those three things, which are factually true. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=317.56s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=320.12s)]
*  And then what happened? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=321.88s)]
*  Well, the FBI began investigating me the next day and they investigated me for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=323.16s)]
*  a full year from December of 07 to December of 08. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=327.24s)]
*  Did they tell you they're investigating you? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=330.36s)]
*  No, I read about it in CNN. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  So how were they investigating you? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=336.44s)]
*  You know, I don't know. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=339.72s)]
*  They never sought to interview me. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=341.16s)]
*  I ran out and I hired an attorney. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=343.16s)]
*  And we leaked that to the press that, oh, I'm represented by this legal giant [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  in Washington, DC. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=351.48s)]
*  It was, it was Plato Kacharis, who's no longer living. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=352.68s)]
*  But one of the most famous lawyers in the United States. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  One of the most famous lawyers, the greatest in Washington. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=357.8s)]
*  And they never contacted him. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=361.72s)]
*  I really don't know what constituted an FBI investigation, but a year later in 2008, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=364.20000000000005s)]
*  they dropped the case and they said that I had not committed a crime. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  But when they investigate you, what is that? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=373.72s)]
*  Do you have any sense of what that means? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=375.48s)]
*  Like are they? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=377.48s)]
*  In the subsequent investigation, which we can get to, it was very clear what it meant. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=378.44s)]
*  But in that year, I think what they did, and I'm speculating here, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=383.16s)]
*  is that they went over the ABC News interview and a subsequent interview I did with the New York Times. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=388.2s)]
*  They parsed it and they decided that I had not committed a crime. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=394.52s)]
*  Now, in the declination letter that they sent to my attorney declining to prosecute me, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=398.52s)]
*  they said that it was illegal to classify a program if the program is illegal. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=403.24s)]
*  Wait, can I ask you, is it a federal crime to say the president is lying? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=409.72s)]
*  No. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh, it's not. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=414.92s)]
*  Oh, so you're allowed, in the United States, you're allowed, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=415.8s)]
*  if you see a politician lying, you can say that person's lying? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  Call them on it. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=421.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=421.96000000000004s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=422.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=422.6s)]
*  Because it is America after all. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=423.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=424.68s)]
*  Just want to make sure. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=425.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=426.04s)]
*  So, so they, the FBI spends a year investigating you [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=426.76000000000005s)]
*  because you say the president is lying. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=431.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  Totally normal. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  And you don't know that they're investigating you because they never contacted you or your lawyer. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=436.59999999999997s)]
*  Never contacted you, the one of us. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=439.8s)]
*  So then 2008 rolls around, Bush leaves after two terms, Obama gets elected. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=441.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=445.96s)]
*  And he's very much the peace candidate, he's for transparency. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=446.52s)]
*  Well, I like to say that it was Saint Obama that came down from the heavens [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=449.24s)]
*  into the White House to save us. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=454.2s)]
*  Black Jesus returns. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=455.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=455.96s)]
*  But he's very much, I mean, I remember, in fact, being on television saying, you know, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=457.32s)]
*  he was this wild-eyed, peacenek, lefty guy. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Oh no, he wasn't. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=467.40000000000003s)]
*  Oh, he wasn't. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=468.76s)]
*  Here, this is something that I've puzzled over for a long time. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=470.28000000000003s)]
*  And I've come to the conclusion that the CIA, at the top levels of the CIA, they really love it [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=473.88s)]
*  when a new president is elected and he has no background in intelligence or foreign policy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=482.28s)]
*  Usually, Donald Trump is a very unique figure in this scenario, very unusual. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=488.52s)]
*  But Barack Obama, two years as a senator, two years as a senator, no experience in foreign policy, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  no experience in intelligence. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=502.44s)]
*  The day after an election, the director of the CIA authorizes a president-elect to begin receiving [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=504.76s)]
*  PDB, a president's daily brief. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=511.08s)]
*  And so the day after the election, they go with this 16-page document marked at six levels above [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=513.56s)]
*  top secret, and they say, Mr. President-elect, wait till you see the cool things we're doing [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=521.9599999999999s)]
*  all around the world. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=527.24s)]
*  And they've sucked him in. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=528.92s)]
*  They made him one of the guys. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=530.12s)]
*  And every day they're like, wait till you see the update on what we told you yesterday. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=531.88s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=535.72s)]
*  And then we get the feedback at the CIA. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=536.92s)]
*  Oh, the president loved this. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=540.04s)]
*  The president had a follow-up question on that. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=541.4s)]
*  Oh, the president said, oh my God, when he read this. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=543.4s)]
*  Well, that's almost like you're psychologically profiling the president. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=547.16s)]
*  Oh, I think that's exactly what they do. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=550.92s)]
*  And don't forget, they have an entire staff of psychiatrists and psychologists that do exactly that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  And so they use the tools that they have employed for decades to subvert foreign governments, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=560.28s)]
*  to subvert their own government? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=566.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=568.1999999999999s)]
*  But they smile while they're doing it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=569.34s)]
*  And they say, no, no, we're just trying to forge a good working relationship with the president. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=570.86s)]
*  In fact, for a while in the 90s, they didn't even call him the president. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=575.1800000000001s)]
*  They called him the first customer. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=579.26s)]
*  Swear to God. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=583.4200000000001s)]
*  I know we're getting far afield and we will get back to your story, but it doesn't sound like, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=585.4200000000001s)]
*  so if you look at the org chart, the president controls CIA. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=593.0200000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=595.74s)]
*  But you're describing a situation where CIA kind of controls the president. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=596.8s)]
*  This is another problem. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=600.8s)]
*  It's that presidents come and go every four years, every eight years. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=603.12s)]
*  But these CIA people, they're there for 25, 30, 35 years. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=607.92s)]
*  They don't go anywhere. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=613.12s)]
*  And so if they don't like a president or if a president orders them to do something that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=614.96s)]
*  they don't want to do, they just wait because they know they can wait him out. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=619.28s)]
*  And then he's not going to be president anymore. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=624.08s)]
*  And they can continue on with whatever plan the blob or the deep state wants to implement. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=625.92s)]
*  Donald Trump took a lot of guff in his first term when he [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=632.8s)]
*  used on a regular basis the term deep state. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=636.88s)]
*  And I argued from the very beginning, it is a deep state. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=640.16s)]
*  Maybe you don't like the terminology. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=644.0799999999999s)]
*  You don't have to call it the deep state. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=645.8399999999999s)]
*  You can call it the federal bureaucracy. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=647.76s)]
*  You can call it the state. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=649.76s)]
*  But the truth is that it exists. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=651.92s)]
*  I would say by definition, I mean, you just described it, the president and by the way, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=654.0s)]
*  the elected representatives who are the instrument of the population through which they control [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=659.6s)]
*  their government, you know, are perennial. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=663.6s)]
*  They come and go. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=666.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=667.2s)]
*  The people who carry out those orders remain. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=667.68s)]
*  So over time, they are the ones with the power, right? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=671.36s)]
*  And then when they get caught, they scramble. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=673.84s)]
*  I remember Jane Harmon. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=675.36s)]
*  She was a congressman, congresswoman from Venice, California. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=676.72s)]
*  She was the chairwoman of the House Intelligence Committee during the Iraq War. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=681.84s)]
*  And she was briefed on the torture program. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=686.24s)]
*  Well, when I went public on the torture program, reporters had questions. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=689.12s)]
*  Well, did Congress approve this? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=693.4399999999999s)]
*  Of course, Congress approved it and Congress appropriated money for it. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=695.36s)]
*  So she's the chairman. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=699.12s)]
*  And reporters went to her and said, hey, what about this torture program? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=700.88s)]
*  And she said, I didn't know anything about the torture program. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=705.12s)]
*  She's a liar. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=708.48s)]
*  She was lying. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=709.36s)]
*  And I remember saying it to the New York Times. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=711.12s)]
*  I said she was in the room when it was briefed. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  And when she was challenged, she said, oh, yeah, I remember that day. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=722.48s)]
*  I got up and I left early and I left one of my aides as a note taker and he never briefed me, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=723.12s)]
*  which is also a lie. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=729.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=730.72s)]
*  Well, she was just a pure tool of the intelligence and of foreign government. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=731.28s)]
*  And that's an ongoing problem on Capitol Hill is rather than being overseers, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=734.88s)]
*  they're cheerleaders for the intelligence. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=739.28s)]
*  So that is absolutely true. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=741.1999999999999s)]
*  And I've known them all. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=742.56s)]
*  And if you criticize any of the intel agencies, particularly CIA, which is the most powerful, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=743.8399999999999s)]
*  they're immediately defensive about it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=751.04s)]
*  Like it's their job to defend these agencies when in fact their job, as you said, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=753.8399999999999s)]
*  is to oversee these agencies and to keep them within the boundaries of the Constitution. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=758.72s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=763.04s)]
*  You know, I say all the time that we really did have real oversight for a while from the 70s [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=764.0s)]
*  into the 1980s, a decade, a decade and a half where people really did exert influence over [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=774.32s)]
*  intelligence policy by really examining some of these covert action programs. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=782.88s)]
*  But Pat Moynihan is dead and Barry Goldwater is dead and all these other senators and [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=788.0s)]
*  congressmen, Otis Pike, they're all gone. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=796.0s)]
*  They're all dead. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=798.72s)]
*  And now we've got people who just egg on the intelligence communities. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=800.4000000000001s)]
*  And I'll give you an example. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  When I got out of prison, I was invited to a dinner at the Greek ambassador's residence [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=807.44s)]
*  and I went and there was a senator there, a democratic senator there, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=812.48s)]
*  who's a member of the Intelligence Committee. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=818.16s)]
*  And so he came up to me and he said, hey, welcome home. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=820.64s)]
*  We were really worried about you. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=823.68s)]
*  And I said, oh, thank you. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  I said, Senator, I've got to tell you, I was disappointed that you didn't say anything. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=826.48s)]
*  You didn't express any support or anything related to my case. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=832.16s)]
*  And he got very angry and he said, listen, it took everything I had just to not lose [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=836.96s)]
*  my security clearance. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=841.6s)]
*  And I said, so you're afraid of them. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=843.6800000000001s)]
*  That's what this is. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=846.96s)]
*  And he walked away. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=848.4s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=849.36s)]
*  That's disgusting. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=852.16s)]
*  But I think you can go through, certainly in the Senate, you can go through the roster of [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=853.84s)]
*  the hundred members of the Senate and then compare it to the list of the permanent, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=860.4s)]
*  the Committee on Intelligence. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  And those are the worst, those are the most dishonest people. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=871.12s)]
*  The most rotten, the most morally compromised, the most dishonest by far. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=872.88s)]
*  I have to agree. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=878.0s)]
*  That was my experience. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=879.68s)]
*  How does that happen? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=880.32s)]
*  Like sitting on the Senate Intel Committee is like just a sign that, you know. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=883.28s)]
*  You're one of the in-crowd. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=890.32s)]
*  Worse than that. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=892.48s)]
*  Like you're not someone I would invite to dinner at my house. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=893.6s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=896.8s)]
*  How? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=897.6s)]
*  How do they identify the most morally compromised people? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=898.4s)]
*  I wonder if this began with 9-11. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that it didn't. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=908.32s)]
*  I think it began earlier than that, like during the Clinton administration. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=909.84s)]
*  Where everybody just, where the intelligence community was seen as a force for good, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  which was odd to me. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=925.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's how I grew up thinking that, for sure. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=926.88s)]
*  I mean, it was not even questioned. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=930.4000000000001s)]
*  When I first joined the agency, they were still sort of getting over the whole [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=932.24s)]
*  Church Committee era. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=938.72s)]
*  And then when Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=940.72s)]
*  we were told that there were going to be big changes at the agency. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=944.32s)]
*  And indeed, one of the things that Clinton did was he ordered what they called a cull. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=947.6s)]
*  So we had to go through the files of literally every recruited agent. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=952.08s)]
*  In the CIA, and if they had any human rights problem, they were fired. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=956.32s)]
*  We just cut off contact with them. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=961.6s)]
*  And I remember thinking, wow, they're actually serious about this. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=963.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm very pleasantly surprised. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  But then 9-11 happened. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  And not only did that go out the window, the pendulum swung so far to the other side [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=971.6s)]
*  that it has yet to go back to its point of equilibrium. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=978.5600000000001s)]
*  And then just naturally, inevitably, predictably, the tactics that and other agencies used [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=983.36s)]
*  against foreign governments were used against the US government, the elected government, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=989.6s)]
*  and the population of the country. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=993.84s)]
*  I know you and I agree on this. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=995.76s)]
*  We've talked about this in the past. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=996.96s)]
*  But the CIA is forbidden by law from spying on American citizens, as is NSA. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=998.4s)]
*  It's a part of NSA's charter that it may not collect the communications of American citizens [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1004.88s)]
*  or US persons. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1011.6s)]
*  NSA spied on me and leaked the information to the New York Times. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1013.12s)]
*  And leaked the information. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1016.08s)]
*  I remember it very well. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1017.52s)]
*  To control me. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1019.1999999999999s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1020.96s)]
*  Guess what happened? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1021.84s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1022.88s)]
*  And here again, Congress just says, well, what are we going to do? [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1023.76s)]
*  Yeah, we're afraid of them too. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1027.2s)]
*  So here's a company we're always excited to advertise because we actually use their [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1028.8s)]
*  products every day at Maryweather Farms. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1033.12s)]
*  Remember when everybody knew their neighborhood butcher? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1034.8s)]
*  You look back and you feel like, oh, there was something really important about that. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1037.12s)]
*  Knowing the person who cut your meat. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1041.28s)]
*  And at some point, your grandparents are the people who raised their meat. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1043.84s)]
*  So they could trust what they ate. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1047.76s)]
*  But that time is long gone. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1050.08s)]
*  It's been replaced by an era of grocery store mystery meat boxed by distant beef corporations. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1051.2s)]
*  None of which raised a single cow. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1058.08s)]
*  Unlike your childhood, they don't know you. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1059.76s)]
*  They're not interested in you. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1062.6399999999999s)]
*  The whole thing is creepy. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1063.92s)]
*  The only thing that matters to them is money and God knows what you're eating. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1065.52s)]
*  Maryweather Farms is the answer to that. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  They raise their cattle in the U.S. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1070.48s)]
*  In Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado, and they prepare their meat themselves in their facilities [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1072.24s)]
*  in this country. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1077.52s)]
*  No middlemen, no outsourcing, no foreign beef sneaking through a back door. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1078.88s)]
*  Nobody wants foreign meat. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1083.6s)]
*  Sorry, we have a great meat, the best meat here in the United States, and we buy ours [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1085.04s)]
*  at Maryweather Farms. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1088.96s)]
*  Their cuts are pasture raised, hormone free, antibiotic free, and absolutely delicious. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1090.32s)]
*  I gorged on one last night. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1095.52s)]
*  You got to try this for real. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1097.28s)]
*  Every day we eat it. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1099.04s)]

*  So we'll get back to all this, but I just want to return to the thread of what happened [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1110.4s)]
*  to you. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1114.96s)]
*  So Obama gets elected and you've got to think because your real crime was calling the [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1116.0s)]
*  president a liar, George W. Bush, you had to have thought that once he was gone, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1122.64s)]
*  you know, it was going to be forgotten. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1128.48s)]
*  When- [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1129.92s)]
*  Because what you said was true. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1130.56s)]
*  That's right. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1131.6s)]
*  And when my attorneys received this declination letter, my wife and I actually went out and [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1132.08s)]
*  celebrated that night. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1135.76s)]
*  We went out and had dinner. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1136.72s)]
*  I had no idea that three weeks later when Barack Obama became president that that's [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1139.12s)]
*  when my trouble was really going to start. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1143.84s)]
*  Obama initially named John Brennan as the CIA director. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1147.04s)]
*  Liberals were up in arms at the time. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1152.16s)]
*  And so that nomination was withdrawn. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1154.4s)]
*  You may recall and he named Brennan instead the deputy national security advisor for [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1157.2s)]
*  counterterrorism. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1162.4s)]
*  John Brennan and I always hated each other. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1163.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't know why he hated me. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1167.8400000000001s)]
*  I hated him for what were very clear- [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1169.2s)]
*  How weird he seems like such a marvelous guy. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1170.96s)]
*  Such a sweetheart. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1172.48s)]
*  I found him to be a very dark figure, very dangerous, willing to take risks that no one [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1174.96s)]
*  should take without appropriate congressional oversight. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1182.16s)]
*  And frankly, I said this on your show one time, and I don't mean to sound like that [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1185.2s)]
*  guy, but I thought he was in over his head intellectually in that position. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1192.4s)]
*  He was not- [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1198.0s)]
*  When did you meet him? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1198.88s)]
*  I met him in 1990, January of 1990. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1200.48s)]
*  Over 35 years ago. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1203.76s)]
*  Yes. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1204.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1205.28s)]
*  So it's fair to say you- [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1205.52s)]
*  Oh, I knew him very, very well. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1206.8s)]
*  In fact, when I was the executive assistant to the deputy director for operations, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1209.28s)]
*  John was the- [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1214.8s)]
*  First, he was the deputy executive director and then executive director of the CIA. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1216.0s)]
*  So he was the number three officer in the CIA while I was the assistant to the number [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1220.72s)]
*  four officer in the CIA. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1226.96s)]
*  So I briefed him every single morning, and we just did not like or respect one another. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1228.8s)]
*  Why didn't you like or respect him? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1235.28s)]
*  First of all, I thought he was unqualified, number one. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1237.76s)]
*  John made a life in analysis, but he struck up a very close friendship with George Tenet [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1240.64s)]
*  when George was at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1249.6s)]
*  George became the deputy CIA director and then CIA director. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1252.96s)]
*  And every time George got promoted, he promoted Brennan, but he promoted him into jobs that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1255.92s)]
*  he simply wasn't qualified for. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1260.16s)]
*  Like the station chief in Riyadh, this is a guy that had been an analyst for 20-something years, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1262.48s)]
*  and you're going to make him the station chief? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1269.92s)]
*  Not only has he never recruited an agent, he's never even met one. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1271.52s)]
*  And that's who you want in charge of operations. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1275.76s)]
*  In Riyadh? [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1279.1200000000001s)]
*  In Riyadh, one of the most important places in the Middle East. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1279.76s)]
*  Complicated place. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1282.8s)]
*  Very complicated. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1284.24s)]
*  And then when he went back, he named him the deputy executive director. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1285.92s)]
*  So he's running the day-to-day operations of the entire CIA, the whole thing. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1291.2s)]
*  It just didn't make sense to me. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1296.8s)]
*  So you thought that he was unqualified, but it sounds like you thought that he was [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1298.48s)]
*  morally unqualified also. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1303.2s)]
*  I always believed he was morally unqualified. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1304.72s)]
*  John had a reputation as being vindictive. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1307.1200000000001s)]
*  He had once worked for a woman who didn't like or respect him, and she let him go. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1311.92s)]
*  He got a job briefing George Tenet at the National Security Council, and then when George [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1320.16s)]
*  was promoted, he promoted John to the point where he called this woman in and he fired her. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1326.72s)]
*  Was that really necessary? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1333.52s)]
*  You could take the high road. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1335.44s)]
*  There's no reason to be that guy that you just go in and start trashing your enemies. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1336.96s)]
*  But that's what he did. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1342.48s)]
*  And there was a group of guys that came of age with him, and he all promoted all of them [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1343.8400000000001s)]
*  with himself, with his rising boat. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  They all went to the top. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1355.44s)]
*  And I'll tell you too, I was in operations at the time, working for people who had spent [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1357.44s)]
*  30 years in operations, and they disliked him with a special kind of passion. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1363.2s)]
*  And it was because they didn't respect him either. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1369.92s)]
*  It was clear. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1372.96s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1374.88s)]
*  You said he was dangerous? [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1377.28s)]
*  I always thought that he was dangerous. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1379.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1381.52s)]
*  That's a strong thing to say about somebody. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1382.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1384.72s)]
*  I'm going to get on my soapbox again, so forgive me. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1387.28s)]
*  But we're a nation of laws, right? [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1389.76s)]
*  We're a nation of laws, and whether you like the law or you don't like the law, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1392.88s)]
*  you have to respect it, or you work to change it. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1396.56s)]
*  You can't just pretend that the law doesn't exist. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1400.88s)]
*  Oh, we're the good guys. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1403.84s)]
*  So let's talk about the torture program for a second. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1405.3600000000001s)]
*  Here he is, the number three in the CIA, and the leadership wants to implement a torture program. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1409.12s)]
*  Okay, we've got this thing called the Federal Torture Act of 1946 that says you can't do that. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1416.8s)]
*  In 1946, we executed Japanese soldiers who had waterboarded American POWs. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1422.08s)]
*  We executed, that was a death penalty offense to waterboard somebody. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  In January of 1968, the Washington Post ran a front page [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1432.4799999999998s)]
*  photograph of an American soldier waterboarding a North Vietnamese prisoner. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1436.96s)]
*  The day that that picture was published, the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1442.0s)]
*  ordered an investigation. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1446.96s)]
*  That soldier was arrested, he was convicted of torture, and sentenced to 20 years at Leavenworth. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1448.32s)]
*  But then in 2002, like magic, it's all legal. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1455.8400000000001s)]
*  So waterboarding has been around a long time. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1460.64s)]
*  Oh, it's been around a long time. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1462.56s)]
*  The Chinese actually invented waterboarding. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1464.16s)]
*  Of course they did. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1466.0s)]
*  In like the 15th century. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1466.56s)]
*  Can you explain waterboarding for a moment? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1469.44s)]
*  Sure. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1471.44s)]
*  So a prisoner is strapped to a board with his feet elevated compared to his head. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1472.32s)]
*  There's something put in his mouth like material, a cloth, burlap, whatever, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1479.28s)]
*  and then water is poured on his face. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1485.28s)]
*  So it's supposed to give you the feeling that you're drowning. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1487.6s)]
*  In fact, in many cases you are drowning because a lot of water is getting past that cloth. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1493.6s)]
*  In the case of Abu Zubaydah, and we can talk about him later if you want, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1498.48s)]
*  we drowned him, his heart stopped beating, and he had to be revived so that he could be tortured [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1502.56s)]
*  more. That's what waterboarding is. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1508.56s)]
*  Why is it done? [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  The idea is, this is a term that the CIA came up with, the idea is to instill the feeling of [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1514.08s)]
*  learned helplessness in the prisoner so that the prisoner is so terrified of you, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1520.64s)]
*  so terrified of what you can do to him that he'll whimper as soon as you walk into the room and just [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1527.2800000000002s)]
*  confess everything that you want him to confess to. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1534.24s)]
*  But the problem is that torture just simply doesn't work. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1537.2800000000002s)]
*  This is a proven fact that decades of scientists and psychologists and psychiatrists have proven [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1541.2800000000002s)]
*  it doesn't work. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1548.88s)]
*  And so the prisoner will tell you what he thinks you want to know just to get you to stop [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  torturing him. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1555.68s)]
*  We know from prisoners held in North Vietnamese prisons, American prisoners, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1557.44s)]
*  that when asked, well, who was on your ship? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1562.16s)]
*  What were the names of the men on your ship? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1565.1200000000001s)]
*  They would recite like the Pittsburgh Steelers offensive line from 1968, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1566.64s)]
*  or just make up names or childhood friends just to get them to stop torturing. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1573.7600000000002s)]
*  So it just doesn't work. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1579.1200000000001s)]
*  So what was the process post 9-11 for waterboarding? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1581.5200000000002s)]
*  I mean, I noticed that in the later reports, some of these guys were waterboarded, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1586.4s)]
*  KSM, for example. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1591.2800000000002s)]
*  187 times. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1592.88s)]
*  187 times. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1594.24s)]
*  So was he coming up with the offensive line of the Pittsburgh Steelers every time? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1595.44s)]
*  Why would they keep doing that? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1603.1200000000001s)]
*  He even, well, they were convinced that he knew the location of Osama bin Laden, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1604.24s)]
*  and that he knew what the plans were for the next attack on the United States. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1610.0s)]
*  Well, there were no plans for the next attack. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1614.32s)]
*  Sometimes there would be 10 or 12 guys sitting around a campfire in Afghanistan saying, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1617.1200000000001s)]
*  you know what we should do? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1621.6s)]
*  We should attack the Chicago Stock Exchange. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1622.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah, that's what we should do. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1628.08s)]
*  That's not a plot. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1630.4s)]
*  That's just some guy at a campfire just throwing it out there. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1631.84s)]
*  So they were convinced that there was another plot planned and they wanted to get it. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1635.36s)]
*  But 187 times. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1642.6399999999999s)]
*  And KSM ended up confessing to the Daniel Pearl murder, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1644.4799999999998s)]
*  which we know for a fact he wasn't even in Pakistan when Daniel Pearl was murdered. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1647.76s)]
*  He confessed to it? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1653.36s)]
*  He confessed to it. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1654.1599999999999s)]
*  And then when they showed him the video showing that it wasn't his arm that was sawing off [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1656.3999999999999s)]
*  Daniel Pearl's head, he's like, no, look, look at the hair on that arm. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1660.32s)]
*  My arm's that hairy. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1663.36s)]
*  That's my arm. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1664.6399999999999s)]
*  No, you didn't kill Daniel Pearl. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1665.6s)]
*  Stop saying that you did. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1667.52s)]
*  A lot of hairy people in the region. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1668.08s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1669.36s)]
*  But 187 times? [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1672.3999999999999s)]
*  And Abu Zubaydah, 83 times. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1674.56s)]
*  They waterboarded him 83 times? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1676.96s)]
*  It was worse than that. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  There's this conventional wisdom that waterboarding was the worst. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1680.32s)]
*  It was sort of the top of the list of torture techniques. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1683.52s)]
*  There were worse techniques. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1688.24s)]
*  We killed people with other techniques. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1690.08s)]
*  For example, the cold cell. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1692.8s)]
*  So you're stripped naked, you're chained to an eye bolt in the ceiling, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1694.8s)]
*  so you can't sit or kneel or lay or get comfortable in any way. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1699.04s)]
*  Your cell is chilled to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1703.36s)]
*  And then every hour, a CIA officer goes into your cell and throws a bucket of ice water on you. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1705.92s)]
*  And people died of hypothermia. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1711.44s)]
*  The Justice Department didn't say we could murder people. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1713.92s)]
*  They said we could use these different techniques. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1717.2s)]
*  They didn't say we could use this cold cell. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1720.0s)]
*  That was just made up. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1721.6000000000001s)]
*  And people died? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1722.8000000000002s)]
*  There was another one. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1724.72s)]
*  Well, sleep deprivation. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1725.68s)]
*  The American Psychological Association, the APA, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1727.6000000000001s)]
*  has published studies saying that people begin to lose their minds at day seven with no sleep. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  They begin to die at day nine. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1737.8400000000001s)]
*  Their organs begin to shut down. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1741.2s)]
*  The CIA was authorized to keep people awake for 12 days. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1743.36s)]
*  And people just drop dead as they're being kept awake with that eye bolt in the ceiling again, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1747.76s)]
*  and strong lights and hard rock, death metal music 24 hours a day on a loop. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1754.8s)]
*  You go crazy and then your organs just don't work. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1760.8799999999999s)]
*  Do we have any idea how many people died under torture? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1763.52s)]
*  The CIA has never said. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1766.4799999999998s)]
*  They, it was in the Senate torture report, but it was redacted. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1768.0s)]
*  So we don't know the number. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1773.52s)]
*  What's your sense? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1775.2s)]
*  At least a half a dozen. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1776.8s)]
*  Or torture to death. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1778.8s)]
*  Yeah, to death. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1779.8400000000001s)]
*  Maintain energy, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1797.76s)]
*  They make blue light glasses, red light therapy, a lot of different products like this. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1799.68s)]
*  And they help you address the trials of modern life effortlessly and naturally. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1804.48s)]
*  Now, one of the things they make is a sauna. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1809.44s)]
*  We could go on and be boring about sauna, take one every single day. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1811.68s)]
*  But on charge makes a sleek infrared sauna blanket. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1814.96s)]
*  It's got a similar effect to a finished sauna, but without the intense heat. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1818.88s)]
*  It's an easy and comfortable 30 minute session. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1824.3200000000002s)]
*  You can enjoy relaxing with your family, talking to people, reading. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1826.72s)]
*  And it leaves you feeling refreshed and slightly euphoric, but in a good, healthy way. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1830.32s)]
*  It's a great addition to your wellness routine. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1835.3600000000001s)]
*  You may even drop a few pounds doing it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1837.28s)]
*  Bond Charge ships worldwide. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1839.3600000000001s)]
*  Bond Charge, whether it's B-O-N-C-H-A-R-G-E, offers free shipping and allows for easy returns [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1841.52s)]

*  Use the coupon code Tucker to save 15%. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1850.8s)]
*  Do you think, obviously you're very much part of the story. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1854.32s)]
*  You went to prison because of it. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  So it's kind of hard to, you know, you have an interest in this. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1860.08s)]
*  Sure. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1863.6s)]
*  But as objectively as you can, do you think there was a lot of useful information produced [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1864.16s)]
*  by all this torture? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1870.56s)]
*  No, not by the torture. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1872.08s)]
*  Listen, it's like a kick in my gut to have to compliment the FBI. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1874.0s)]
*  It really is. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1879.2s)]
*  When I've had 22 FBI agents raiding my house and taking all my stuff. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1880.8s)]
*  But if there's one thing that the FBI is really good at, it's interrogations. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1886.4s)]
*  And they proved it with Abu Zubaydah. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1892.16s)]
*  They proved that if you treat a prisoner with respect and engage in rapport building and [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1894.88s)]
*  take some time to build this relationship, the prisoner will tell you everything that [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1901.04s)]
*  you want to know. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1905.84s)]
*  And that's what happened with Abu Zubaydah. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1906.8s)]
*  But every time the CIA would step in and begin torturing him, he would clam up, like [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1908.88s)]
*  completely clam up. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1914.0800000000002s)]
*  And then the FBI would have to go back in, try to reverse the damage and start the whole [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1915.92s)]
*  thing over again. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1920.24s)]
*  So you gave that interview at the end of 2007 in which you said, really just, it was pretty [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1924.0s)]
*  spare interview. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1931.0400000000002s)]
*  It was. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1932.24s)]
*  You didn't go into any detail. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1932.48s)]
*  No. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1934.4s)]
*  So, investigation happens, it's dropped, Obama gets elected. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1934.9s)]
*  A month later, John Brennan, I interrupted you. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1940.66s)]
*  I had no idea that John Brennan asked Eric Holder to secretly reopen the case against [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  me. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1950.18s)]
*  Why do you think he did that? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1951.0600000000002s)]
*  Of all the problems that were going on in the world. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1953.6200000000001s)]
*  There are no other problems in the world, right? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1955.7800000000002s)]
*  I think for two reasons. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1957.8600000000001s)]
*  Number one, he genuinely disliked me. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1959.06s)]
*  And he has this history of going after people using lawfare, which now we all know what [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1962.66s)]
*  that means, using lawfare to take down his enemies. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1969.7s)]
*  Number one. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1974.02s)]
*  Lawfare understates it. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1974.82s)]
*  Violence. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1976.02s)]
*  I mean, they came to your house, they cuffed you, they threw you in a cell. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1976.9s)]
*  Those are acts of violence, physical force. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1981.46s)]
*  Very much so. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1984.98s)]
*  That's right. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1985.46s)]
*  So if you'll do that, if you'll take a man from his five children and lock him in a cell [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1985.94s)]
*  for years. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1990.9s)]
*  And they fired my wife just because she was married to me. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1992.42s)]
*  She was a senior CIA officer. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1995.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1999.54s)]
*  So you've answered the question, how is John Brennan a dangerous man? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=1999.8600000000001s)]
*  So he goes to the then Attorney General Eric Holder and says, we need to reopen. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2002.5800000000002s)]
*  Of all the problems that we've got, we need to make sure John Curiacu goes to jail. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2007.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2012.74s)]
*  We received 15,000 pages of classified discovery in my case, but we found in that discovery, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2013.6200000000001s)]
*  three memos. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2019.94s)]
*  There was a memo from John Brennan to Eric Holder saying, charge him with espionage. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2020.98s)]
*  Espionage? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2026.2600000000002s)]
*  Espionage, which can be a death penalty charge, I might add. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2026.98s)]
*  Who are you spying for? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2031.0600000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2032.18s)]
*  Who? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2033.8600000000001s)]
*  Well, did they allege you were spying for somebody? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2034.1000000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2036.18s)]
*  What they said is that I told the media that the CIA had a torture program. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2036.66s)]
*  Because the media published it, our enemies knew that we had this top secret program. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2042.8999999999999s)]
*  But how is that espionage? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2047.62s)]
*  I know. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2048.8199999999997s)]
*  It's not. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2049.46s)]
*  So Holder writes back and says, my people don't think he committed espionage. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2050.9s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2054.98s)]
*  And then Brennan wrote back and said, charge him anyway and make him defend himself. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2057.7s)]
*  Try not to use the effort. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2061.7799999999997s)]
*  This is my new thing, self-improvement journey I'm taking, but it's making me mad hearing this [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2062.8199999999997s)]
*  because I happened to be in Pakistan around the time you were a very dangerous country. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2069.38s)]
*  Oh boy, I was. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2075.2200000000003s)]
*  I wasn't doing anything dangerous. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2075.7000000000003s)]
*  Oh no, it was. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2076.82s)]
*  Super dangerous, the most dangerous place I've ever been. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2077.46s)]
*  On earth at the time. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2079.62s)]
*  It's not an overstatement to say you're risking your life, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2082.98s)]
*  father of all these kids, to fight the war on terror against the Islamic terrorists. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2085.1400000000003s)]
*  And now they're accusing you of aiding those terrorists? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2091.2200000000003s)]
*  Aiding the enemy. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2094.7400000000002s)]
*  It gets worse. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2095.62s)]
*  That's really over the top. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2096.5s)]
*  Oh yeah, I don't think I've ever told you this story, but when I was on the Senate Foreign [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2098.02s)]
*  Relations Committee, I was the senior investigator. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2101.94s)]
*  And so one of the great things about that job is you get to have lunch with diplomats [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2105.38s)]
*  from around the world and just talk about the issues of the day. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2110.5s)]
*  You were working for CIA at the time? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2113.14s)]
*  No, I was working for John Kerry when he was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2114.42s)]
*  When was this? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2119.46s)]
*  2009 to 2011. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2121.78s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2124.42s)]
*  So I got a call from a Japanese diplomat and he said, hey, let's have lunch. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2125.3799999999997s)]
*  I said, great. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2130.9799999999996s)]
*  So we meet at a restaurant on Capitol Hill. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2131.7s)]
*  His English was so bad that we had to do the lunches in Arabic. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2134.2599999999998s)]
*  He was an Arabist and I'm an Arabist, and so we would have our lunches in Arabic. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2139.4599999999996s)]
*  And I remember what we talked about in that first meeting. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2144.8199999999997s)]
*  I know it's absurd, isn't it? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2147.4599999999996s)]
*  You and the Japanese guy speaking Arabic? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2148.5s)]
*  Surprised somebody didn't call the cops. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2151.4599999999996s)]
*  Surprised. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2153.14s)]
*  So we talked about the Israeli election, the Turkish election. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2154.3399999999997s)]
*  We talked about the peace process. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2158.8199999999997s)]
*  I remember it very clearly. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2160.58s)]
*  And at the end of it, he said to me, so what's next for you? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2162.58s)]
*  And I said, I think I'm going to resign soon. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2166.3399999999997s)]
*  I promised Senator Kerry that I would give him two years. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2169.3799999999997s)]
*  It's been two and a half and I have five kids that I need to put through college. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2172.02s)]
*  And he says, no, don't do that. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2176.2599999999998s)]
*  If you give me information, I can give you money. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2179.62s)]
*  And I said, what in the world is wrong with you? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2184.58s)]
*  Do you have any idea how many times I've made that pitch? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2189.06s)]
*  Shame on you for cold pitching me. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2192.74s)]
*  And I indignantly got up and walked out and I went directly without stopping [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2195.14s)]
*  to the office of the Senate Security Officer. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2200.5s)]
*  And I said, I was just pitched by a foreign intelligence officer. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2203.06s)]
*  I need to report it. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2206.1s)]
*  He said, was it that damn Russian again? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2207.46s)]
*  And I said, no, it was Japanese. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2209.46s)]
*  He said, Japanese? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2211.62s)]
*  Well, occasionally they're poking around looking for trade secrets. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2213.06s)]
*  So he said, sit at the standalone computer, write it up and I'll send it to the FBI. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2217.38s)]
*  I said, fine. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2222.26s)]
*  I wrote the entire thing as a memo. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2222.9s)]
*  He sent it to the FBI. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2224.6600000000003s)]
*  The next day he calls me and says, two FBI agents are going to come up. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2225.86s)]
*  They want to interview you. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2228.9s)]
*  I said, great. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2229.78s)]
*  I go back down to the security vault and these two young FBI agents come. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2230.7400000000002s)]
*  I tell them the story again and they said, okay, here's what we want you to do. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2235.86s)]
*  We want you to call him back and invite him to lunch and try to get him to tell you exactly [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2239.46s)]
*  what information he's looking for and what he's willing to pay for it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2244.9s)]
*  And because I'm a patriot, I said, do you want me to wear a wire or something? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2248.98s)]
*  And they said, no, we'll just be at the next table. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2253.46s)]
*  We'll listen to everything. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2255.2999999999997s)]
*  You're such a boy scout. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2256.18s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2257.7s)]
*  Well, kind of. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2258.98s)]
*  I love my country. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2259.7s)]
*  Everyone who lives in DC has had something like what you described, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2260.34s)]
*  but I've never heard of anybody going to the authorities over it. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2264.26s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2267.0600000000004s)]
*  So the morning of the lunch, they called me and said, something came up. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2267.6200000000003s)]
*  We can't do it. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2272.82s)]
*  So do the lunch and write another memo. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2273.86s)]
*  So I did. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2276.6600000000003s)]
*  And I wrote up a comprehensive report. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2277.5400000000004s)]
*  I sent it back to the FBI. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2279.78s)]
*  Then they asked me to do it a third time, a fourth time, and a fifth time, which I did. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2281.1400000000003s)]
*  And in the final lunch, it was a place in Georgetown. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2286.42s)]
*  Which place? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2289.0600000000004s)]
*  It was on Lower Wisconsin, the famous Italian place. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2290.58s)]
*  Where they give you after dinner drinks at the end. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2297.2999999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2300.42s)]
*  And the ladies in the front window making the pasta. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2300.98s)]
*  Such a great restaurant. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2303.54s)]
*  Filomena. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2304.8199999999997s)]
*  Filomena, thank you. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2305.2999999999997s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2306.18s)]
*  Forever. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2306.66s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2306.9s)]
*  I love Filomena. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2309.54s)]
*  It's wonderful. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2310.42s)]
*  It really is wonderful. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2311.38s)]
*  So I do it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2314.74s)]
*  And in that final lunch, he says, I got promoted. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2316.1s)]
*  I got my dream job. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2319.62s)]
*  I'm going to be the number two at the Japanese embassy in Cairo. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2321.14s)]
*  I said, congratulations. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2324.66s)]
*  I shook his hand. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2325.78s)]
*  I never talked to him again. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2326.58s)]
*  A year later, I've been arrested and we get discovery. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2328.74s)]
*  And we see that there never was any Japanese diplomat. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2334.02s)]
*  He was an FBI agent. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2338.18s)]
*  What? [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2340.1s)]
*  Trying to get me to commit actual espionage. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2340.98s)]
*  But I kept reporting the meetings back to the FBI. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2345.62s)]
*  And then there was a memo to Peter Strzok who actually put the cuffs on me in 2012. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2349.94s)]
*  The Peter Strzok? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2360.58s)]
*  The Peter Strzok. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2361.46s)]
*  He actually, I'll get to that in a second. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2363.06s)]
*  But one of the FBI agents wrote to Peter Strzok and said, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2365.3799999999997s)]
*  we should end this operation. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2370.3399999999997s)]
*  He's clearly not going to take the bait. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2371.7s)]
*  No way. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2374.98s)]
*  And I said to my lawyer, why would they do this? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2376.18s)]
*  I'm a patriot. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2378.5s)]
*  The FBI did that to you? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  Because I hadn't committed espionage. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2383.7799999999997s)]
*  We've got to burn the government down actually. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2385.54s)]
*  I mean, that's... [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2387.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2388.18s)]
*  John Brennan specifically said, charge him with espionage. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2389.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, I hadn't committed espionage. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2392.66s)]
*  And so they're trying to get me to commit it so they can charge me. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2395.2999999999997s)]
*  I kept reporting it back to them. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2398.58s)]
*  Who was the guy? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2400.02s)]
*  The Japanese diplomat. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2401.54s)]
*  He was just an Asian FBI agent who didn't speak a word of Japanese, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2403.14s)]
*  but he did speak Arabic. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2407.2999999999997s)]
*  So he pretended... [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2409.22s)]
*  Oh no, you're blowing my mind. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2410.18s)]
*  He pretended to not speak English so that I wouldn't be alerted. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2411.7s)]
*  Are you sure this happened? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2415.46s)]
*  100%. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2416.58s)]
*  It was all in the discovery. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2418.66s)]
*  But Brennan said, charge him with espionage. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2421.06s)]
*  And they were like, okay, well, we got to charge him with espionage. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2424.2599999999998s)]
*  We have to create the crime in order to fit the charge. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2426.5s)]
*  And what happened? [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2429.2999999999997s)]
*  They charged me with three counts of espionage. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2430.2599999999998s)]
*  How can you believe that? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2432.82s)]
*  So like, I have friends who have a lot of interesting information on the Oklahoma City bombing. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2433.94s)]
*  And my brain doesn't want to go there. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2440.5s)]
*  Same with January 6th. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2443.06s)]
*  Same with a bunch of different operations the FBI has been involved in, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2444.5s)]
*  where it seems pretty obvious they're trying to get people to commit felonies. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2447.6200000000003s)]
*  Acts of violence, acts of terrorism. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2452.34s)]
*  And I'm like, I just, I can't bring myself to believe [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2454.7400000000002s)]
*  that that happens in the United States, but you're describing it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2458.42s)]
*  Oh, Tucker, I was in prison with this poor guy. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2461.14s)]
*  This guy was just a dope. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2463.7s)]
*  And he and a couple of buddies were in a bar one day in Cleveland. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2466.8199999999997s)]
*  And this other guy was there drinking with him and he said, [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2471.7799999999997s)]
*  hey, you know what would be fun? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2475.2999999999997s)]
*  We should blow up the Route 82 bridge. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2476.42s)]
*  And they were saying, they were drunk. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2478.3399999999997s)]
*  They said, yeah, that would be so much fun. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2479.8599999999997s)]
*  I'll get the explosives. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2481.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, he's an FBI informant. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2483.46s)]
*  The FBI gives inert explosives. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2485.14s)]
*  These idiots go out to the Route 82 bridge and try to blow it up. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2487.14s)]
*  It doesn't blow up. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2490.98s)]
*  And then the FBI comes out from behind the bushes. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2492.02s)]
*  They got 20, 25 and 30 years in prison. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2494.34s)]
*  Why would they do that to these guys? [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2498.26s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2499.86s)]
*  It wasn't their idea to blow up the stupid bridge. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2500.98s)]
*  But why were they targeted? [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2503.22s)]
*  Because this is how FBI agents get promoted. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2504.98s)]
*  They don't get promoted by not arresting you. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2508.42s)]
*  They get promoted by arresting you and heaping charges on you [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2511.06s)]
*  so that eventually you go bankrupt and you give up. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2514.82s)]
*  And then they say, okay, here's the deal. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2517.62s)]
*  We'll drop all the charges but one. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2519.62s)]
*  You take a guilty plea to a felony and then you do two years or whatever. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2521.7799999999997s)]
*  But these guys went to trial because they said, no, it wasn't our idea. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2528.3399999999997s)]
*  It wasn't our explosives. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2533.06s)]
*  It was the FBI's explosives. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2534.18s)]
*  And it was the FBI's guy that talked us into doing it. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2535.62s)]
*  We were just having drinks that night. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2539.2999999999997s)]
*  We weren't going to blow up a bridge. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2540.8199999999997s)]
*  But that's how they get ahead in Washington. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2543.54s)]
*  That is, but they're, I mean, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2546.66s)]
*  they're targeting American citizens for destruction. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2549.62s)]
*  Sure. Sure. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2553.8599999999997s)]
*  That's what they do. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2556.74s)]
*  You need to shut down the FBI right away. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2559.22s)]
*  I would not object to that at all. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2561.62s)]
*  And in my case, they charged me with three counts of espionage. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2566.02s)]
*  What is the fucking point of all of this? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2568.98s)]
*  Pay your taxes. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2571.3799999999997s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2572.4199999999996s)]
*  Waste the flag on your front lawn. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2573.14s)]
*  I do those things. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2574.58s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2575.54s)]
*  And then they try to destroy you? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2578.34s)]
*  Because your crime is, you didn't like John Brennan [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2581.46s)]
*  when you both were junior guys at CIA. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2585.14s)]
*  And I aired the TV laundry. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2588.02s)]
*  Because you correctly said the president, George W. Bush, [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2588.74s)]
*  Was lying. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2594.02s)]
*  Was lying because he is a liar, unfortunately. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2594.42s)]
*  And so like, let's spend millions of dollars. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2599.7799999999997s)]
*  Six million dollars of the taxpayers' money [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2603.54s)]
*  is what they spent on my case. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2606.82s)]
*  To destroy you. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2607.86s)]
*  Six million dollars. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2609.7s)]
*  And you need a pardon right away from Trump. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2610.5s)]
*  But okay, sorry, sorry. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2613.3s)]
*  You're making me emotional. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2614.42s)]
*  This is just too ridiculous. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2616.02s)]
*  I've known you a while. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2617.54s)]
*  I didn't know the details. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2618.5s)]
*  Yeah, it was ugly. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2620.58s)]
*  Okay, so can we just go back? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2622.02s)]
*  So Brennan orders this investigation. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2623.54s)]
*  The second Obama takes office goes to Eric Holder. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2626.74s)]
*  Holder says we, actually our staff attorneys [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2630.58s)]
*  don't think that he committed espionage. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2634.66s)]
*  Then what happens? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2638.1s)]
*  Do you know that they're investigating you again? [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2639.3s)]
*  No idea. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2641.3s)]
*  No idea that I'm being investigated. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2642.74s)]
*  So I'm going on my merry way. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2644.66s)]
*  I'm trying to build a business and consulting. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2646.34s)]
*  I have some big name clients. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2648.82s)]
*  Things are starting to look up. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2650.82s)]
*  In fact, I was going to New York so often [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2652.18s)]
*  that my wife said, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2655.3s)]
*  you know, maybe we should buy a little pied-a-terre there. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2656.5s)]
*  So instead of staying in a hotel, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2659.22s)]
*  because things are going really well right now, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2660.58s)]
*  you should talk to a real estate agent. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2662.5s)]
*  It was so exciting, right? [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2664.74s)]
*  And then 22 FBI agents raid my house. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2666.98s)]
*  When? [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2669.7s)]
*  January 12, 2012. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2671.62s)]
*  2012? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2675.9399999999996s)]
*  2012. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2676.98s)]
*  They investigated me for three years. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2677.8599999999997s)]
*  Did you know they were investigating you? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2681.8599999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2683.4599999999996s)]
*  And then when we got the discovery… [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2683.7799999999997s)]
*  Wait, they investigated you for three years. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2685.06s)]
*  This is now quite a few years after. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2686.74s)]
*  The only thing you've done wrong is you gave an interview [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2690.42s)]
*  to ABC News saying three things. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2692.74s)]
*  The president lied. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2694.58s)]
*  We had a torture program. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2695.38s)]
*  And what was the third one? [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2696.34s)]
*  The torture was signed by the president. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2698.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2701.14s)]
*  All true. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2702.18s)]
*  All true. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2702.8199999999997s)]
*  And so for five, six years, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2704.02s)]
*  they investigate you without telling you. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2706.34s)]
*  What were they doing to investigate you? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2709.7s)]
*  They had my phones tapped. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2711.54s)]
*  Actually? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2713.94s)]
*  Actually tapped. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2714.5s)]
*  Yep. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2715.54s)]
*  They intercepted all of my emails. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2716.34s)]
*  And I'll tell you something funny about that. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2719.06s)]
*  For real? [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2721.3s)]
*  There's a service that you can pay like $36 a year [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2722.6600000000003s)]
*  called readnotify.com. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2726.26s)]
*  So if I want to write you an email, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2728.34s)]
*  I put tuckercarlson at aol.com.readnotify.com. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2731.38s)]
*  And when you access it, it'll show me. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2737.2200000000003s)]
*  Tucker Carlson read your email. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2739.78s)]
*  He read it for two minutes and 37 seconds. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2741.54s)]
*  He forwarded it. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2744.1000000000004s)]
*  He deleted it. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2745.3s)]
*  He filed it, whatever. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2746.34s)]
*  And this is where he was located. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2747.94s)]
*  And it has a town and it'll have sometimes geo coordinates. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2750.02s)]
*  Damn. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2755.3s)]
*  I wanted to write a Freedom of Information Act request [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2757.38s)]
*  because I was thinking of writing a book [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2760.6600000000003s)]
*  about an author, a novelist from the 50s. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2762.5800000000004s)]
*  And I wanted to know whether he had worked at the CIA. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2765.6200000000003s)]
*  So I sent this Freedom of Information Act request. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2768.26s)]
*  Actually, I called a journalist that I knew [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2771.06s)]
*  who writes these things every day. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2776.42s)]
*  And I said, I don't want it to get rejected. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2778.18s)]
*  So can you walk me through the process? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2780.1s)]
*  He said, yeah, just send me what you have [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2782.1s)]
*  and I'll correct it for you. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2784.1s)]
*  So I sent it to him and I got a readnotify notification. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2786.42s)]
*  And I looked at it and it said, accessed in Washington, DC. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2790.1s)]
*  And I said to him, I called him and I said, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2794.34s)]
*  you're not in Washington today, right? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2797.2999999999997s)]
*  And he said, no, I'm in LA. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2799.06s)]
*  Why? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2801.22s)]
*  I said, because somebody just accessed the email [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2801.86s)]
*  and it's in Washington. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2803.86s)]
*  I said, hold on, because it has geo coordinates attached to it. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2805.06s)]
*  So I took the geo coordinates. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2808.34s)]
*  I put it into Google Earth. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2809.86s)]
*  You know, Google Earth, it shows you the whole planet [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2811.38s)]
*  and then it kind of zeros in on the FBI's Washington field office. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2813.06s)]
*  No way. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2816.98s)]
*  And he said, are they looking at you or are they looking at me? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2818.18s)]
*  I said, I haven't done anything. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2821.94s)]
*  They're probably looking at you. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2823.94s)]
*  Because you didn't even know you're under investigation. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2825.2999999999997s)]
*  No idea. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2828.18s)]
*  But they were looking at me and they were accessing all of my emails. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2829.46s)]
*  They even followed my family and me into church, into Target to go shopping. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2833.3799999999997s)]
*  And they would write these stupid reports. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2839.7799999999997s)]
*  Subject and his family went to church, sat in the first pew. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2842.1s)]
*  Hour and 15 minutes later, subject and family went home. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2845.62s)]
*  All because you called the president a liar? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2849.22s)]
*  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2852.3399999999997s)]
*  You may have noticed that the companies whose products you buy [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2853.46s)]
*  tend to kind of hate you. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2855.54s)]
*  They're controlled by massive multinational corporations [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2856.82s)]
*  and they have all kinds of weird agendas [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2860.6600000000003s)]
*  that you're supporting when you buy their products. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2862.6600000000003s)]
*  We didn't realize that nicotine pouches, which we've used for years, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2864.42s)]
*  were in this category. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2868.1800000000003s)]
*  We just want a nicotine pouch. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2869.38s)]
*  And then they lecture you and take the money you give them [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2870.6600000000003s)]
*  to support things that you hate. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2873.38s)]
*  So we decide we're going to make our own and we did. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2875.06s)]
*  And it is, we can say, not bragging here, just stating fact, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2877.46s)]
*  the single best nicotine pouch in the world. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2881.06s)]
*  It's called Al. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2883.86s)]
*  And it comes in all kinds of excellent flavors. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2884.9s)]
*  Wintergreen, tropical fruit, chilled mint, refreshing chill, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2887.78s)]
*  sweet nectar, and a bunch of others that we're rolling out. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2892.1800000000003s)]
*  By the way, they're 20 per tin, not 15 like some of our competitors [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2894.42s)]
*  will not be named. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2898.5800000000004s)]
*  Zen. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2899.38s)]
*  And they're in three, six, and nine milligrams. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2900.02s)]
*  It is the single best nicotine pouch ever made. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2902.82s)]
*  Will not regret it. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2905.6200000000003s)]
*  Am I missing part of this? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2909.06s)]
*  Brendan complained that I had aired the CIA's dirty laundry. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2911.3s)]
*  But that was, I think, more of just an excuse to cover up his own narcissism. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2914.98s)]
*  But I mean, right. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2921.38s)]
*  But airing dirty laundry, calling liars liars. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2923.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2926.9s)]
*  These are not crimes. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2927.38s)]
*  No, they're not crimes. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2928.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2929.38s)]
*  But am I missing something? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2930.82s)]
*  Did you kill anybody? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2932.1000000000004s)]
*  Were you dealing heroin at all? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2933.2200000000003s)]
*  Nope. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2935.06s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2936.34s)]
*  And then- [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2937.54s)]
*  You didn't start some kind of fake cryptocurrency company? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2937.94s)]
*  I wish I had thought of it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2940.26s)]
*  I'd be rich today. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2941.54s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2943.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2945.2200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2946.82s)]
*  I hope at some point we can talk about all the actual criminals who are now richers living [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2947.06s)]
*  in my neighborhood richer than ever. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2950.82s)]
*  Okay, so, but you don't know any of this is going on. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2952.9s)]
*  When do you get confirmation that you're the target of an investigation? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2955.46s)]
*  The FBI called me. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2959.2200000000003s)]
*  I was sitting at my computer one morning writing an op-ed, and the FBI called me. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2960.6600000000003s)]
*  And I looked at my phone and it said, Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2964.5800000000004s)]
*  And I thought, what in the world is that? [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2967.06s)]
*  So I answered it. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2969.46s)]
*  I said, hi, this is John. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2970.42s)]
*  May I help you? [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2971.86s)]
*  And he says, hi, this is Special Agent. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2972.9s)]
*  I forget what. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2974.98s)]
*  Do you remember that case that you helped us out with when you were on Capitol Hill? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2976.5s)]
*  Because remember, I didn't know that this Japanese guy was an FBI agent yet. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2980.26s)]
*  I said, sure. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2984.98s)]
*  This is so freaking bonkers. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2986.1s)]
*  And he said, well, we have another case and we need your help. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2988.5s)]
*  And I said, because I'm an idiot and a patriot, I said, anything for the FBI. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2991.86s)]
*  What do you want from me? [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2997.94s)]
*  That's what I told him. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=2999.54s)]
*  He said, can you come down here tomorrow at 10? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3000.58s)]
*  I said, absolutely. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3002.82s)]
*  So I went at 10 o'clock and I said, what do you want me to do? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3004.6600000000003s)]
*  I said, this is to the FBI building downtown. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3008.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3011.2200000000003s)]
*  I said, is it with the Russians? [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3011.78s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3014.42s)]
*  Well, you know, before we get to that, he says, I wanted to ask you, you know, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3016.1000000000004s)]
*  I just read your book, which was a lie. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3020.42s)]
*  I had a book that had come out two years earlier. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3022.1800000000003s)]
*  I just read your book and I just want to ask you a couple of questions. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3024.34s)]
*  And it was all about the torture program. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3027.06s)]
*  And I'm getting more and more nervous. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3029.2999999999997s)]
*  And finally, what were the questions? [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3032.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, when you were in Pakistan and you were describing this piece of technology, [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3035.2999999999997s)]
*  did you get that cleared by the CIA? [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3041.94s)]
*  I said, of course I got it cleared. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3044.42s)]
*  I said, it took me nine months to write that book and 22 months to get it cleared [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3045.94s)]
*  at the CIA's publications review board. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3050.02s)]
*  Well, you know, what about this guy? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3053.7s)]
*  You mentioned this guy. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3055.46s)]
*  You just say John Doe. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3057.46s)]
*  Do you remember his name? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3058.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I remember his name. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3060.02s)]
*  And then I said, what are we talking about here? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3062.42s)]
*  And then one of them said, well, we probably should tell you that as we're speaking right now, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3066.5s)]
*  we're raiding your house. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3071.78s)]
*  We're confiscating all of your electronics. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3073.6200000000003s)]
*  And you're going to be charged with a lot of crimes. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3076.42s)]
*  What? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3079.86s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3080.5s)]
*  And thank God. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3081.94s)]
*  As you were talking, they're raiding your house? [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3083.78s)]
*  My wife later told me that as soon as I got on the metro to go to the FBI, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3087.06s)]
*  they just broke down the door. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3092.9s)]
*  Was she home? [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3094.5800000000004s)]
*  With our two month old son. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3095.54s)]
*  Yep. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3102.82s)]
*  And then one of the female FBI agents. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3103.38s)]
*  I don't think drain the swamp is not strong enough. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3105.46s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3108.6600000000003s)]
*  Burn it down. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3109.7000000000003s)]
*  Burn it down. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3111.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3112.5800000000004s)]
*  You know, this is neither here nor there because my opinion is not important. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3113.3s)]
*  But when Cash Patel was named the director of the FBI, I wrote an op-ed in a leftist [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3116.8999999999996s)]
*  for a leftist news outlet celebrating this appointment, saying this is exactly what we [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3122.9799999999996s)]
*  need to do. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3129.14s)]
*  We need to tear the place down to its studs. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3129.7799999999997s)]
*  If there's going to be a federal law enforcement organization, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3133.4599999999996s)]
*  this one needs to be scrapped and rebuilt and nobody else has the guts to do it. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3137.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3142.9799999999996s)]
*  Let's build them in your headquarters though. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3143.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3145.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3146.02s)]
*  In Kansas, maybe. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3147.62s)]
*  Yeah, Leavenworth. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3150.34s)]
*  Oh, excuse me. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3152.1s)]
*  One final sentence. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3153.94s)]
*  I thank God that I had the presence of mind to say, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3155.78s)]
*  I want to speak to my attorney and I'm not saying anything else. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3159.14s)]
*  And that was the only reason they didn't put the cuffs on me right there. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3161.7s)]
*  So I said, I want to leave. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3165.86s)]
*  And I got up and they said, just a minute, just a minute. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3167.46s)]
*  I said, no, if I'm not under arrest, that means I'm free to leave. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3169.46s)]
*  And as I walked out, Peter Strzok was standing there and he said, did he implicate himself? [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3172.9s)]
*  And the guy says, not really, but I'll tell you about it in a second. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3179.86s)]
*  And he turned to me and he said, you're free to go. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3183.2200000000003s)]
*  Did you have any idea what this was about? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3187.7000000000003s)]
*  No, no idea. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3189.78s)]
*  No idea. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3192.7400000000002s)]
*  They charged me with this. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3194.34s)]
*  This is like a bad dream. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3195.7000000000003s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3197.38s)]
*  It was a nightmare. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3198.82s)]
*  I went outside. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3199.7799999999997s)]
*  I called my lawyer. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3201.46s)]
*  He told me, come to the office immediately. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3202.98s)]
*  I went, told him everything that happened. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3205.14s)]
*  He told me, try to take it easy. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3207.46s)]
*  I said, this is a death penalty case. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3209.3s)]
*  He said, just take it easy. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3211.7799999999997s)]
*  They're not going to see what was happening. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3213.22s)]
*  Did you call home and ask your wife? [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3214.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3216.02s)]
*  And she was just wonderful. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3216.74s)]
*  She was as calm as I wished I could be. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3219.86s)]
*  And she said, the FBI is here. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3225.54s)]
*  I said, I know. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3227.62s)]
*  I said, are they treating you with respect? [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3229.1400000000003s)]
*  And she said, well, one of the female agents said, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3231.5400000000004s)]
*  why don't you sit with that beautiful baby and don't get up? [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3234.9s)]
*  You want to go fuck yourself. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3240.1800000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3241.5400000000004s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3242.26s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3242.98s)]
*  Talking that way to your wife with a newborn baby. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3245.6200000000003s)]
*  And then within hours, of course, they leak it to the media immediately. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3249.5400000000004s)]
*  So within hours, all four of my clients, and these were like [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3253.94s)]
*  household name clients that I had for this consulting business I was trying to get [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3257.54s)]
*  up and running, all four of them dropped me. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3263.06s)]
*  That day? [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3266.02s)]
*  That day. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3266.66s)]
*  And then immediately- [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3267.7s)]
*  The Profiles in Courage Award. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3268.82s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell you. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3270.34s)]
*  The phone, we counted actually. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3272.18s)]
*  We got something like 65 or 67 calls from the media that night. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3276.18s)]
*  I just shut my phone off. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3282.18s)]
*  We unplugged the, we had landlines back then. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3283.62s)]
*  One of the local networks put a truck in front of our house with a spotlight on the house. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3286.42s)]
*  No way. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3291.38s)]
*  Oh, it was humiliating, just utterly humiliating. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3292.02s)]
*  And I just want to say for the fifth time, because at this point, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3296.42s)]
*  I mean, you're being treated like El Chapo. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3299.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3301.86s)]
*  Your only crime was an ABC interview with Brian Ross in 2007, in which you say, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3303.2200000000003s)]
*  yes, the CIA does have a torture program. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3311.1400000000003s)]
*  I know because I worked there and the president authored it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3312.98s)]
*  Authorized it and lied about it in public. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3316.02s)]
*  That's, that's your, some total of your crimes. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3317.7799999999997s)]
*  That was it. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3319.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm going to cut to the chase here. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3322.58s)]
*  This is so unbelievable. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3323.94s)]
*  So you go to your lawyer's office, you find out you're being charged with espionage. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3325.14s)]
*  I called my wife. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3329.14s)]
*  She came and picked me up and I told her, I'm going to kill myself. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3329.94s)]
*  This is a death penalty case. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3334.5s)]
*  I haven't done anything wrong. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3337.2999999999997s)]
*  And she's like, you're not going to kill yourself. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3339.54s)]
*  Let's just take this one step at a time. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3341.7s)]
*  What did the lawyers say? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3344.2599999999998s)]
*  And then we started taking it from there. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3346.1s)]
*  When did you get arrested? [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3350.3399999999997s)]
*  January, January, no, four days later. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3352.3399999999997s)]
*  That was on a, ah, so this is another trick that they use. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3355.38s)]
*  And they did this with the J six people. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3358.58s)]
*  The FBI loves, loves, loves to make their arrests on Fridays. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3361.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3367.7799999999997s)]
*  Or Thursdays after five, because there are no federal arraignments on Fridays. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3368.58s)]
*  So you get arrested on a Thursday evening and you have to spend Thursday night, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3374.58s)]
*  Friday night, Saturday night, and Sunday night in jail. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3379.06s)]
*  And then you get to go to a rain with that Monday. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3382.7400000000002s)]
*  No, only because I asked to see my attorney. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3385.86s)]
*  And so they told me I had to turn myself in at the FBI Monday morning at 10. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3389.38s)]
*  Tucker, when I tell you I had these guys on me from Thursday to Monday, like white on rice, [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3396.1s)]
*  I mean six feet off my bunk, my bumper everywhere we went. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3402.18s)]
*  Even one of my neighbors called to say he had gotten up in the middle of the night [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3405.54s)]
*  to go to the bathroom and he looked out the window and he said, buddy, there are like [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3409.14s)]
*  carloads of people out there at three o'clock in the morning, just staring at your house. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3413.8599999999997s)]
*  And I said, I know, I know it's the FBI. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3419.22s)]
*  There's nothing I can do. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3421.54s)]
*  And so they followed us like there were FBI cars on either side of us and behind us [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3423.54s)]
*  as we drove to the FBI that Monday morning. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3429.7s)]
*  And then when I got out of the car and walked into the FBI headquarters, they broke off. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3432.5s)]
*  And then they chained me to a metal bench. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3437.8599999999997s)]
*  Actually? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3443.3799999999997s)]
*  With a handcuff. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3443.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3445.8599999999997s)]
*  And Struck was there. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3447.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, he was there. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3448.58s)]
*  And you know, but I didn't know he was Peter Struck until I got a call in 2019 [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3449.7s)]
*  from a reporter at the Washington Post, 20, no, no, 2017, reporter for the Washington Post. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3458.18s)]
*  And he said, hey, I wanted to get your thoughts on Peter Struck being fired from the FBI. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3464.3399999999997s)]
*  I said, I don't know anything about Peter Struck other than what I've read in the [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3470.8199999999997s)]
*  Washington Post. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3474.58s)]
*  He said, no, Peter Struck arrested you in January of 2012. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3475.7s)]
*  I said, that was Peter Struck? [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3480.1s)]
*  He said, yeah, it was Peter Struck. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3482.4199999999996s)]
*  He was the head of the counter intelligence division. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3484.02s)]
*  It was Peter Struck that wrote the reports on your arrest. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3488.02s)]
*  He's the one that physically put the cuffs on you. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3490.98s)]
*  And I said, oh my God, I said, yes, I'll give you a statement. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3493.78s)]
*  He said, what's the statement? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3496.66s)]
*  And I said, the statement is that, the statement is that karma is a bitch and now it's his turn. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3498.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3507.38s)]
*  So all they printed was now it's his turn. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3508.02s)]
*  I think he wound up getting like a million dollar settlement. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3510.58s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3513.06s)]
*  And there was a GoFundMe. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3514.34s)]
*  He got richer. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3515.86s)]
*  He got richer. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3516.74s)]
*  And there was a GoFundMe that raised another half a million dollars. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3517.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3521.2999999999997s)]
*  This is so... [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3523.2999999999997s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3524.02s)]
*  So, okay, you're charged just to... [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3525.46s)]
*  Yeah, three counts of espionage. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3529.46s)]
*  Three counts of espionage, but not specifying who you spied for. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3531.22s)]
*  Nope. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3535.14s)]
*  There was never even an accusation that I had spied for anybody. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3535.94s)]
*  One count of making a false statement. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3539.46s)]
*  We were never exactly sure what the false statement was supposed to have been. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3541.62s)]
*  It had something to do with the clearance process for my book. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3546.34s)]
*  And one count of violating the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3550.1000000000004s)]
*  Did you reveal the identities of anyone? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3557.46s)]
*  Here's that story. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3559.7000000000003s)]
*  In the summer of 2008, six months after I blew the whistle, I got an email from a journalist who [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3561.38s)]
*  was writing a book on the CIA's rendition program. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3569.46s)]
*  I told him, I don't know anything about renditions. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3573.1400000000003s)]
*  Kidnapping was not my thing at the agency. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3575.54s)]
*  I can't help you. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3577.7799999999997s)]
*  So he sends me a list of a dozen names. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3579.3s)]
*  He said, can you introduce me to any of these people so that I can interview them? [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3581.06s)]
*  I said, I don't know any of these people. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3584.74s)]
*  Then he sent me a second list of a dozen names. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3586.5s)]
*  And I said, look, you clearly know this better than I do. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3589.62s)]
*  I don't know any of these people. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3593.7s)]
*  And then he said, there's a guy that you mentioned on like page 165 of your book. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3596.42s)]
*  You called him John. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3604.8999999999996s)]
*  Can I mention, can I interview him? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3607.14s)]
*  And I said, oh, you're talking about John Doe. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3610.02s)]
*  I don't know whatever happened to him. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3613.8599999999997s)]
*  He's probably retired and living in Virginia somewhere. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3615.06s)]
*  They got me. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3618.5s)]
*  I confirmed the surname of a former colleague. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3619.8599999999997s)]
*  That was it. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3625.2999999999997s)]
*  That's the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3626.58s)]
*  And they knew that because they were listening to the call. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3630.02s)]
*  Well, it got worse. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3636.2599999999998s)]
*  They didn't recognize that as a violation until the journalist, who wasn't really writing a book, [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3637.86s)]
*  gave the name to Human Rights Watch. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3648.2599999999998s)]
*  Human Rights Watch gave the name to the Guantanamo defense attorneys. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3652.98s)]
*  The Guantanamo defense attorneys wrote a classified motion telling the judge at Guantanamo, [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3656.66s)]
*  we'd like to interview this John Doe. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3662.18s)]
*  The judge said, hey, this name is probably classified. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3664.98s)]
*  He gave it to the FBI. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3668.5s)]
*  They gave it to the CIA. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3670.2599999999998s)]
*  The CIA gave it to John Brennan. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3672.3399999999997s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3674.2599999999998s)]
*  What do you mean the journalist wasn't really writing a book? [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3675.14s)]
*  He was pretending to write a book on the Abu Omar rendition from Milan. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3677.94s)]
*  There really was no book. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3682.66s)]
*  He was really working for the Guantanamo defense attorneys [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3684.26s)]
*  as kind of a private eye without telling anybody. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3687.94s)]
*  What? [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3691.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3691.94s)]
*  Man, the level of treachery. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3693.86s)]
*  Yeah, welcome to Washington. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3695.7000000000003s)]
*  It's that bad. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3697.86s)]
*  Oh, I'm very aware of that. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3699.5400000000004s)]
*  It is. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3701.46s)]
*  I'm so glad I'm not there anymore. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3702.7400000000002s)]
*  Oh my God, I can't wait until the day I can leave. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3704.34s)]
*  It's like nothing is as it seems. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3708.5800000000004s)]
*  Everyone's lying. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3710.82s)]
*  Everyone's pretending to be something he's not. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3711.86s)]
*  Underneath it all is the willingness to hurt people, to kill them. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3715.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3719.2200000000003s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3720.42s)]
*  It's not just like we're competing and I'm elbowing you out of the way. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3721.78s)]
*  I'm going to get that promotion before you do. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3725.7000000000003s)]
*  If I need to make sure you die in prison, that's okay. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3728.34s)]
*  That's really sad. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3731.6200000000003s)]
*  Speaking of which, I took a plea to make the... [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3732.7400000000002s)]
*  First of all, they waited until I went bankrupt [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3737.86s)]
*  and then they dropped all three of the espionage charges. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3740.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so what were you facing initially? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3745.22s)]
*  You get charged, you get... [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3747.2999999999997s)]
*  Forty-five years. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3748.66s)]
*  Forty-five years in prison? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3750.98s)]
*  And one of the attorneys in the Obama Holder Justice Department said to me [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3752.8999999999996s)]
*  at the first proffer meeting, they offered me 45 years, and this woman says, [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3761.06s)]
*  take the deal, Mr. Kiriakou, and you may live to meet your grandchildren. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3765.22s)]
*  Do you remember her name? [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3769.62s)]
*  I don't. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3770.58s)]
*  I remember she had a Vietnamese name like Nguyen or Tran or something like that, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3771.06s)]
*  but she ended up getting promoted in the Biden Justice Department. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3775.62s)]
*  Really? [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3780.18s)]
*  Very important, yeah. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3780.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3784.5s)]
*  I hope that she becomes famous for that. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3785.14s)]
*  I hope so too. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3788.02s)]
*  That level of cruelty to another human being, there's no justification for that. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3788.82s)]
*  They wanted me to die in prison. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3792.9s)]
*  That was the plan. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3795.38s)]
*  And so my attorney said, you haven't done anything wrong, we're going to go to trial. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3797.2200000000003s)]
*  We're going to go to trial. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3801.86s)]
*  And I said, okay, let's do it. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3802.9s)]
*  Can I ask you, did anyone allege that you lied ever? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3803.94s)]
*  Ever. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3806.42s)]
*  Never. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3806.9s)]
*  Never! [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3808.1800000000003s)]
*  And that's a really important point. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3809.0600000000004s)]
*  And we talked about that. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3811.6200000000003s)]
*  We talked about me testifying in my trial because literally everything I said was the truth. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3812.82s)]
*  In fact, fast forward to December of 2014, I'm going to be released from prison in six weeks [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3818.42s)]
*  and I called my wife and I was allowed to call her for 15 minutes every other day. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3825.38s)]
*  And I said, how was your day? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3829.94s)]
*  And she said, it was great. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3831.54s)]
*  And I said, great? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3833.1400000000003s)]
*  Why was it so great? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3834.26s)]
*  And she said, because the Senate torture report came out today [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3835.78s)]
*  and it proved that everything you said was true. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3838.58s)]
*  So I said, you know what? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3843.2200000000003s)]
*  That made it worth it. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3844.82s)]
*  So you went to prison, you were facing life and actually you're facing the death penalty [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3845.86s)]
*  initially because you told the truth about other people's lies. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3849.06s)]
*  Correct. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3855.38s)]
*  So the truth teller, and I'm just, I want to put a very fine point on this because I think [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3856.42s)]
*  it is a trend and I think it's a sign of evil. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3860.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, the definition of evil is lies, lying. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3864.02s)]
*  And the truth teller faces death, the liars thrive. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3867.62s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3873.06s)]
*  So that's a system that can't continue. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3873.62s)]
*  That's not a virtuous system. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3875.46s)]
*  That's an evil system. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3876.6600000000003s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3877.46s)]
*  And may I add a statistic? [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3878.34s)]
*  The Espionage Act was written in 1917. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3881.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3884.82s)]
*  To combat German saboteurs during the First World War. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3885.14s)]
*  1917 being one of the darkest periods in American history. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3888.66s)]
*  When it comes to civil liberties, one of the darkest periods. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3891.7s)]
*  The most anti, almost un-American moment. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3894.3399999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3896.8199999999997s)]
*  Really with probably one of the worst presidents we ever had, Woodrow Wilson. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3897.7s)]
*  Double without any question. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3901.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3902.58s)]
*  Destroy Christian Europe for no reason at all. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3902.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3905.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3905.7799999999997s)]
*  The espionage has never been meaningfully updated. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3907.3799999999997s)]
*  In fact, it doesn't even mention the words classified information [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3910.8199999999997s)]
*  because the classification system wasn't invented until the 1950s. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3913.86s)]
*  Most Americans didn't have electricity in 1917. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3916.42s)]
*  Exactly right. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3918.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3919.38s)]
*  Between 1917 and the election of Barack Obama, three Americans were charged with espionage [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3921.7000000000003s)]
*  for speaking to the press. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3928.7400000000002s)]
*  Under Barack Obama, eight people, almost three times all previous presidents combined, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3930.58s)]
*  were charged with espionage for speaking to the press. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3938.26s)]
*  Three times. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3941.3799999999997s)]
*  And none of them was charged with lying. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3942.58s)]
*  Not a single one of them. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3945.14s)]
*  Because lying is not a crime. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3946.58s)]
*  That's right. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3948.1s)]
*  Telling the truth is a crime. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3948.8999999999996s)]
*  That's it right there. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3950.3399999999997s)]
*  That's all you need to know. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3950.9799999999996s)]
*  You can't support a system in which telling the truth is a crime and lying is rewarded. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3952.02s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3957.22s)]
*  I mentioned to you last night privately that one of my attorneys really put this whole [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3958.3399999999997s)]
*  thing into a couple of sentences and it was so powerful, so profound. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3965.8599999999997s)]
*  What he said that it has stuck with me. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3969.78s)]
*  I decided to turn down the Justice Department's best and final offer of two and a half years [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3971.78s)]
*  in prison. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3978.02s)]
*  I said, I haven't done anything wrong. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3978.82s)]
*  And I had this stupid idea that as soon as I get in front of a jury, they're going to [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3981.3s)]
*  see how ridiculous this is and I'm going to be acquitted. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3985.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, that's nuts. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3988.42s)]
*  So he said to me, you know what your problem is? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3990.42s)]
*  Your problem is you think this is about justice and it's not about justice. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3994.9s)]
*  It's about mitigating damage. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=3998.9s)]
*  Take the deal. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4000.9s)]
*  And so I took the deal. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4002.9s)]
*  What was I going to do? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4004.9s)]
*  I have five kids at home. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4006.9s)]
*  Should I take two and a half years? [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4008.9s)]
*  I'm going to do 23 months or should I roll the dice? [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4010.9s)]
*  And I said to him, I said, if I turn the deal down, what am I realistically looking at here? [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4012.9s)]
*  And he said, 12 to 18 years. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4018.9s)]
*  Take the deal. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4020.9s)]
*  Years. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4022.9s)]
*  So I took it. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4024.9s)]
*  For telling the truth in an ABC interview. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4026.9s)]
*  How long was that ABC interview? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4028.9s)]
*  30 minutes, 40 minutes. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4032.9s)]
*  If you had to replay your life, live it again, would you have done that? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4034.9s)]
*  Yes, actually. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4038.9s)]
*  Wow. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4040.9s)]
*  I would have. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4042.9s)]
*  The only thing I would have done differently is I would have had my attorney sitting with me. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4044.9s)]
*  I had to be reactive by hiring an attorney after blowing the whistle. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4046.9s)]
*  So we had to respond to the situation. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4050.9s)]
*  I would have hired the attorney first. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4052.9s)]
*  But yes, somebody had to say something. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4054.9s)]
*  Somebody. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4056.9s)]
*  It's these Bush people and the Obama people who covered up the Bush administration's crimes that were the criminals. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4058.9s)]
*  The amazing thing is Barack Obama, I was there. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4060.9s)]
*  I knew Obama. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4062.9s)]
*  He ran against all that stuff. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4064.9s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4066.9s)]
*  Iraq was the back door. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4068.9s)]
*  Iraq was the back door. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4070.9s)]
*  Iraq was the back door. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4072.9s)]
*  Iraq was the back door. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4074.9s)]
*  Iraq was the back door. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4076.9s)]
*  Iraq was the back door. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4078.9s)]
*  He did. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4080.9s)]
*  Iraq was the bad war. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4082.9s)]
*  Afghanistan was the good war. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4084.9s)]
*  And he ran a campaign against that. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4086.9s)]
*  But he ended up throwing into prison the guy who told the truth about it. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4088.9s)]
*  You know... [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4090.9s)]
*  You know... [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4092.9s)]
*  But he ended up throwing into prison the guy who told the truth about it. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4094.9s)]
*  Mark Halpern and John Heilman wrote a book about the 2008 election and the 2012 election. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4096.9s)]
*  And in the second book, they quote Obama twice, saying things that put it all into perspective. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4102.9s)]
*  Number one, he said, I never said I was a liberal. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4108.9s)]
*  Like why are the liberals so mad? [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4114.04s)]
*  That he's a warmongering, you know, neocon. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4116.04s)]
*  I never said I was a liberal, he said. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4119.5s)]
*  And the other thing he said that really struck me, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4121.2s)]
*  he was talking about the drone program. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4123.54s)]
*  He killed 10 times more people with drones [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4125.12s)]
*  than George W. Bush did. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4128.12s)]
*  And he said, you know, I never realized [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4129.54s)]
*  I would be so good at killing people. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4131.46s)]
*  He's a cold human being. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4134.42s)]
*  What is that? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4135.759999999999s)]
*  That's sociopathy. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4136.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well for sure. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4138.08s)]
*  You have to be a sociopath to even think that way. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4139.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4142.400000000001s)]
*  But he surrounded himself with other sociopaths, [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4143.64s)]
*  like John Brennan, who for sport [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4145.9400000000005s)]
*  would ruin people's lives to the point [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4148.4800000000005s)]
*  where they're actively considering suicide [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4150.04s)]
*  or making plans to die in prison. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4153.52s)]
*  These are Americans he's doing this to. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4156.16s)]
*  Americans. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4158.08s)]
*  Clearly a man capable of great violence. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4161.52s)]
*  And you wonder if he's involved in plotting [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4164.24s)]
*  physical violence against Americans now. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4169.4s)]
*  Would not surprise me at all? [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4171.36s)]
*  I would not be surprised by anything anymore. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4172.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, when President Trump, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4175.2s)]
*  I had to laugh, when President Trump stripped him [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4177.96s)]
*  of his security clearance, I went on one of the networks. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4180.84s)]
*  Well, I went on Fox, but I think I also went on MSNBC [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4183.639999999999s)]
*  that week to say, why does John Brennan [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4186.599999999999s)]
*  deserve a security clearance? [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4190.76s)]
*  Exactly, why don't I have one? [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4191.599999999999s)]
*  He's a private citizen. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4192.44s)]
*  Do you have one? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4193.48s)]
*  I don't. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4194.32s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4195.139999999999s)]
*  See, so why does John Brennan get one? [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4195.98s)]
*  I agree. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4197.5599999999995s)]
*  So I said, of course the president should strip John Brennan [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4198.4s)]
*  of the security clearance. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4200.08s)]
*  And then when he disallowed Brennan [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4200.959999999999s)]
*  from entering into a government building, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4205.24s)]
*  I went on Fox and they said, is this legit? [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4207.799999999999s)]
*  I said, of course it is. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4210.16s)]
*  This guy is so dangerous that he shouldn't be [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4211.839999999999s)]
*  anywhere near a federal building. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4215.48s)]
*  With what we know, he's plotted in the past. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4218.599999999999s)]
*  God knows what he's cooking up today. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4222.36s)]
*  No, I wouldn't trust him in a federal building. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4224.4s)]
*  I wouldn't trust him in a position of trust. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4226.5599999999995s)]
*  And I wouldn't trust him with a security clearance. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4228.96s)]
*  He's dangerous. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4231.92s)]
*  Well, all these people have security clearances, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4234.5599999999995s)]
*  which really are the currency in Washington. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4236.5s)]
*  Very much so. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4238.48s)]
*  They conduct business with that one in DC [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4239.32s)]
*  because everything is classified. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4240.92s)]
*  That's right. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4242.2s)]
*  Not to protect American national security, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4243.04s)]
*  but for the obvious power advantage, [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4245.679999999999s)]
*  it gives the holders of those clearances. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4247.4s)]
*  That's right. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4249.04s)]
*  So, I think there should be a real attempt [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4249.88s)]
*  to do that to a lot of people, like a lot of people. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4253.52s)]
*  I agree. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4255.36s)]
*  But there won't be. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4256.64s)]
*  No, there won't be. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4257.92s)]
*  So anyway, you plead, you get, how much time? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4259.72s)]
*  I got 30 months. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4264.4400000000005s)]
*  And at sentencing, my attorneys asked [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4267.4400000000005s)]
*  that I be sent to a minimum security work camp. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4270.96s)]
*  There are no bars on the windows. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4274.04s)]
*  There are no locks on the doors. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4275.900000000001s)]
*  You're free to come and go. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4277.32s)]
*  Most of those guys worked in town [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4278.36s)]
*  at the local university, sweeping the floors or whatever. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4280.28s)]
*  And there was a possibility that I could get out [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4283.48s)]
*  in 17 months with good behavior and halfway house, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4286.2s)]
*  not halfway house, but home confinement. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4291.82s)]
*  So I said, okay, this will be easy. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4294.799999999999s)]
*  So I get to the prison. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4298.92s)]
*  It's very strange when you go to prison. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4302.28s)]
*  If you're not remanded at sentencing, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4304.2s)]
*  you have to physically drive to the prison [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4306.4s)]
*  and knock on the door and say, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4309.32s)]
*  I'm here to turn myself in for prison. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4312.12s)]
*  The opposite of a jailbreak. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4313.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's nuts. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4315.08s)]
*  It's nuts. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4316.839999999999s)]
*  And of course I've got two cars with me. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4317.679999999999s)]
*  There's a documentary film crew and my lawyers [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4320.28s)]
*  and my cousin and we have this caravan [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4323.799999999999s)]
*  that go to the prison with us. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4327.08s)]
*  So you've already said goodbye to your children. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4330.2s)]
*  Already said goodbye to my children. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4331.5599999999995s)]
*  What was that like? [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4332.88s)]
*  They were very young. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4333.719999999999s)]
*  And so I said, you remember I had that fight with the FBI [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4334.7s)]
*  and they said yes. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4339.34s)]
*  And I said, well, I lost. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4340.74s)]
*  And so I have to go to Pennsylvania for a while [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4342.78s)]
*  and I'm gonna teach bad guys how to read and write [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4346.9s)]
*  because I figured I'd probably teach a GED class [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4351.26s)]
*  or something. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4354.06s)]
*  And I said, but you're gonna come and visit me all the time. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4356.34s)]
*  And then I'm gonna come back home [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4359.06s)]
*  and everything's gonna be great. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4360.48s)]
*  How old were they? [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4361.32s)]
*  They were eight, six and one. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4362.5s)]
*  Your little kids. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4366.74s)]
*  And so. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4369.06s)]
*  Eight, six and one. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4369.9s)]
*  In the visiting room, there was a sign on one of the doors [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4371.62s)]
*  that said inmates only. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4375.02s)]
*  And my eight year old said, dad, what's an inmate? [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4377.42s)]
*  And without thinking, I said, it's a prisoner. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4381.9s)]
*  And he said, wait a minute, are you a prisoner here [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4384.02s)]
*  or are you a teacher here? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4388.34s)]
*  And I said, buddy, I'm a prisoner here. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4391.06s)]
*  But we're gonna get past this. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4396.42s)]
*  It's gonna go quickly and I'm gonna be home [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4398.1s)]
*  and everything's gonna be good again. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4400.9800000000005s)]
*  It took everything I had not to. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4405.660000000001s)]
*  It makes me emotional. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4407.22s)]
*  Yeah, oh, that's bad. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4408.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4410.38s)]
*  I'm out of adjectives actually for that. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4412.14s)]
*  So you didn't wind up in the work camp. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4414.9400000000005s)]
*  No, the CIA under John Brennan, who is. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4417.02s)]
*  He was director by this point. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4422.860000000001s)]
*  No, but he was soon to be director. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4423.9400000000005s)]
*  Actually 2012, yeah, he was director at that point. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4426.38s)]
*  Yes, yes, thanks for correcting me. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4430.1s)]
*  The CIA objected. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4432.900000000001s)]
*  They objected to my placement in a minimum security camp. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4434.14s)]
*  Well, they're vindictive, aren't they? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4436.900000000001s)]
*  I guess ask Julian Assange how vindictive they are. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4438.900000000001s)]
*  And why I got there. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4441.38s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4442.46s)]
*  Ask Julian Assange. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4444.38s)]
*  They almost killed him. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4445.9s)]
*  So. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4448.259999999999s)]
*  Under, Mike Pompeo plotted his murder. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4449.62s)]
*  Literally. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4452.58s)]
*  Who's still free by the way, is Mike Pompeo in jail? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4453.42s)]
*  I haven't seen any announcement that he's been. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4455.5s)]
*  Are you allowed as an appointee to a government, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4457.339999999999s)]
*  not elected, just an appointee, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4460.259999999999s)]
*  are you allowed to plot the murder of people [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4462.259999999999s)]
*  who embarrass the agency you were not? [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4464.42s)]
*  Oh, you're not allowed, okay. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4466.38s)]
*  You are not. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4467.82s)]
*  So you can't use federal funds [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4468.66s)]
*  to murder people who embarrass you. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4470.38s)]
*  Only if you're Barack Obama, but anybody else, no. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4473.099999999999s)]
*  So if you do that, have you committed a crime? [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4476.18s)]
*  Yeah, a serious crime. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4479.7s)]
*  A serious crime would be attempted murder, [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4481.38s)]
*  I think plotting a murder. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4482.86s)]
*  There's a former CIA officer, Bob Bear, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4484.54s)]
*  who was given a choice to either be charged [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4487.14s)]
*  with attempted murder or resign from the agency [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4491.58s)]
*  for talking to a Kurdish group about killing Saddam Hussein. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4494.62s)]
*  So why wasn't Mike Pompeo arrested for talking about, [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4500.9s)]
*  planning, he did more than talking, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4504.0199999999995s)]
*  they planned to murder Julian Assange. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4505.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4509.0599999999995s)]
*  That's a whole different conversation. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4509.9s)]
*  Pompeo keeps threatening to sue me for saying that. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4510.74s)]
*  Well, the facts are a defense. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4512.219999999999s)]
*  I hope he will. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4513.78s)]
*  I hope he will. There you go. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4514.62s)]
*  Discovery would be fun. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4515.82s)]
*  Anyway, sorry. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4517.7s)]
*  So I was in prison. It's also frustrating. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4518.54s)]
*  So you say goodbye to your children. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4519.94s)]
*  I do, I say goodbye to my children. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4521.259999999999s)]
*  The CIA makes certain you don't go to the work camp, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4522.099999999999s)]
*  you go to a prison. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4524.82s)]
*  Yeah, it was five days before I got access [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4525.86s)]
*  to a phone at the prison, and I called my lawyer. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4528.179999999999s)]
*  What was that like, the first five days? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4530.98s)]
*  You know, looking back, I think I was in shock. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4533.66s)]
*  Did you think about fleeing? [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4539.5s)]
*  Everybody does. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4541.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know that I would submit to that. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4543.42s)]
*  I mean, you never know until you're there. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4545.34s)]
*  You find yourself constantly looking at the fences, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4547.179999999999s)]
*  constantly calculating how bad you'll get cut up [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4549.98s)]
*  with the concertina wire. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4553.94s)]
*  No, no, I mean, before you report to prison, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4554.78s)]
*  did you think like, I served this country, [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4556.7s)]
*  I grew up here, you're from a middle-class family, [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4558.42s)]
*  pro-America, you never thought about fleeing the country? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4563.66s)]
*  No, no, because I was right and they were wrong. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4566.46s)]
*  And you know, the truth, Tucker always has a way [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4569.74s)]
*  of coming out, always. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4572.78s)]
*  Sometimes it takes a while, but the truth always comes out. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4575.86s)]
*  And in fact, the deputy director for operations at the CIA [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4579.099999999999s)]
*  under Brennan, Jose Rodriguez, another notorious murderer, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4583.78s)]
*  tweeted at me the night before I left for prison. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4589.74s)]
*  And he said, don't drop the soap. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4592.62s)]
*  He actually tweeted that at you? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4595.86s)]
*  And I tweeted back at him and I said, Jose, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4597.74s)]
*  I am on the right side of history and you are not. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4600.46s)]
*  These people are morally diseased. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4603.46s)]
*  When Michael Avenatti, who I mocked for years [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4606.62s)]
*  as the creepy porn lawyer, went to prison, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4609.5s)]
*  I felt sad for him. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4612.42s)]
*  Sure, because you're a human being. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4613.34s)]
*  I despised him, but he's in prison. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4614.58s)]
*  Ever been to a prison? [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4617.62s)]
*  I've been to many prisons. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4618.58s)]
*  You don't want to be in prison. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4619.58s)]
*  You served in prison. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4620.42s)]
*  You don't want to be in prison. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4621.26s)]
*  To cheer when a man goes to prison [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4622.54s)]
*  and your only crime was embarrassing them [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4624.86s)]
*  by telling the truth. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4626.62s)]
*  Whatever happened to the Jose character? [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4628.06s)]
*  He took MSNBC contributor? [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4631.62s)]
*  He took his $6 million book advance and moved to Florida. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4633.14s)]
*  Actually? [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4636.02s)]
*  Doesn't this, I mean, why are you not insane? [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4639.74s)]
*  I know, right? [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4642.22s)]
*  There's a lightness to you that- [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4643.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4643.9s)]
*  Maybe I'm an idiot, but I really believe [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4645.62s)]
*  that I'm on the right side of this [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4649.94s)]
*  and I'm hopeful that President Trump will pardon me. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4651.62s)]
*  I have an amazing amount of support. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4656.0599999999995s)]
*  I hope that you get a pardon this afternoon. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4660.9s)]
*  I really do. Thank you. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4663.139999999999s)]
*  This is horrifying. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4663.98s)]
*  His enemies are the people who did this to you. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4665.42s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4668.38s)]
*  He ran against this kind of behavior. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4669.219999999999s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4671.179999999999s)]
*  And he write it with the J6 people, with Rod Blagojevich. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4672.46s)]
*  I wrote Rod Blagojevich a letter when he went to prison. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4677.54s)]
*  This is before I was ever in trouble. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4680.74s)]
*  I wrote him a letter and I said, [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4683.1s)]
*  you don't know me, I don't live in Illinois, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4684.34s)]
*  but this is a travesty. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4687.22s)]
*  It was, I remember. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4689.06s)]
*  There's no crime that was actually committed. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4689.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4692.14s)]
*  And then 14 years? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4693.62s)]
*  Have people lost their minds? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4695.62s)]
*  I know. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4697.5s)]
*  But the president, you and I were talking about this [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4698.42s)]
*  privately, the president has been unlike [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4701.5s)]
*  almost every other president in that he's not waiting [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4706.66s)]
*  for the political safe period to issue pardons [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4710.42s)]
*  after an election, right? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4713.78s)]
*  He just issues them as they come to him. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4715.82s)]
*  To pardon Mark Rich because he's sleeping with his wife. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4717.78s)]
*  Precisely. For example. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4720.22s)]
*  Precisely. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4721.7s)]
*  You know who else did that? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4724.26s)]
*  Historians have told us, historians have documented [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4726.02s)]
*  that Abraham Lincoln used to sit up late into the night [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4729.62s)]
*  pardoning people by candlelight because he said, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4733.94s)]
*  for example, that army deserters [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4737.14s)]
*  shouldn't be executed for cowardice. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4740.66s)]
*  I agree. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4743.58s)]
*  He didn't wait until after a congressional election. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4744.78s)]
*  And neither does this president. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4748.82s)]
*  The British army disgraced itself by, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4750.14s)]
*  they murdered a lot of their own men. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4753.42s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4755.14s)]
*  Who snapped. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4755.98s)]
*  Cowardice is contemptible, of course, [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4757.0599999999995s)]
*  but you shouldn't kill a boy because he runs away. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4758.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4761.46s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4762.3s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4763.14s)]
*  It's like, regain your senses for a second. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4763.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4766.34s)]
*  So anyway, the first five days you were in shock. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4767.58s)]
*  I was in shock. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4771.62s)]
*  I was in prison for 40 minutes and the only thing [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4773.0199999999995s)]
*  that the cop who processed me said to me [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4776.3s)]
*  was if somebody comes into your cell uninvited, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4779.0199999999995s)]
*  that's an act of aggression. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4782.78s)]
*  And I said, great, thank you. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4784.26s)]
*  And then he walked away. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4786.18s)]
*  And sure enough, these two guys walk in. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4787.66s)]
*  One of them had a swastika that took up his entire neck, [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4790.9s)]
*  came up onto his face. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4795.0599999999995s)]
*  The other one had, fuck you, tattooed on his eyelids. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4796.82s)]
*  It's like kind of a movie. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4800.7s)]
*  It was nuts. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4801.98s)]
*  And I jumped up and I said, what do you want? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4802.86s)]
*  Because I thought, it's two of them, it's one of me, [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4805.7s)]
*  but I'm gonna do my best. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4807.74s)]
*  You got to, yeah. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4809.099999999999s)]
*  And the one with the swastika said, are you the CIA guy? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4810.82s)]
*  And I said, yeah, so. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4814.18s)]
*  And he said, are you a fag? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4816.26s)]
*  And I said, no, I'm not a fag. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4818.22s)]
*  I haven't even said that word in so many years, but. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4821.820000000001s)]
*  We're not in Georgetown anymore. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4824.06s)]
*  And he says, are you a rat? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4827.06s)]
*  I said, no, I'm not a rat. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4829.38s)]
*  I didn't have anybody else in my case. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4830.820000000001s)]
*  And he said, are you a chomo? [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4832.860000000001s)]
*  I said, I don't know what that word means. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4834.58s)]
*  And he goes, chomo, like I'm stupid, chomo, child molester. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4836.900000000001s)]
*  I said, no, I'm not a child molester. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4841.34s)]
*  And he says, okay, you can sit with the Aryans [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4843.900000000001s)]
*  in the cafeteria. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4845.74s)]
*  And I said, oh, okay then. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4846.74s)]
*  And you know, funny thing, a year later, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4850.58s)]
*  I lived right across the hall from a senior captain, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4852.78s)]
*  the number three in one of New York's five families, right? [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4858.66s)]
*  And he said to me, good, great guy, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4862.38s)]
*  not even good guy, a great guy. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4865.26s)]
*  I would give him the- [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4867.9s)]
*  A good fellow, really. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4868.74s)]
*  He was a good fellow. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4869.58s)]
*  I'd give him the New York Times every day. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4870.4s)]
*  He would give me the New York Post. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4872.219999999999s)]
*  So we traded papers every day. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4873.74s)]
*  Perfect. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4875.26s)]
*  So, you know, he got a Christmas card one year [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4877.14s)]
*  from Derek Jeter that really impressed me. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4880.9800000000005s)]
*  I've met Derek Jeter, nice man. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4884.38s)]
*  Sweet guy. Yeah, absolutely. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4885.5s)]
*  So anyway, he said to me, let me ask you something. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4886.860000000001s)]
*  Why do you sit with those Nazi retards in the cafeteria? [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4890.14s)]
*  I said, I don't know. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4895.46s)]
*  My first day here, they told me to sit with them. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4896.54s)]
*  And he says, very dramatically, [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4898.54s)]
*  from today, you're with the Italians. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4900.3s)]
*  And so from that day, I was with the Italians. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4905.42s)]
*  And you're still friends with some of them. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4908.66s)]
*  I am. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4910.02s)]
*  We were talking about it at dinner last night. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4910.860000000001s)]
*  We talk frequently. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4913.06s)]
*  Good guys. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4914.14s)]
*  Yeah, that was a misapplication of federal power. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4915.3s)]
*  It's like, obviously you don't want organized crime. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4918.02s)]
*  On the other hand, like if that's your number one, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4921.9400000000005s)]
*  well, look at what has happened to America post-mafia. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4924.46s)]
*  Has it gotten a lot better? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4926.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, no, it hasn't. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4928.06s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4928.900000000001s)]
*  No, it hasn't. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4930.18s)]
*  Bensonhurst is not improved. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4931.02s)]
*  No, it hasn't. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4932.38s)]
*  No, I'm aware. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4933.66s)]
*  I'm aware. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4935.46s)]
*  They did a better job of Staten Island [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4936.58s)]
*  than the current rulers have. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4938.34s)]
*  So at this point, your case is well known. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4940.9s)]
*  Not well, it's known. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4948.1s)]
*  Okay, I'm in the media, so I'm sort of following it, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4949.46s)]
*  but I don't really know. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4952.94s)]
*  It's a leak investigation. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4954.82s)]
*  You've somehow betrayed your country. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4956.14s)]
*  That's all we know. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4957.94s)]
*  Right. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4959.06s)]
*  But there are some people who are paying attention [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4961.46s)]
*  and they're making a lot of noise, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4963.660000000001s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4965.18s)]
*  No. It doesn't matter. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4966.42s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4968.34s)]
*  My support came from people on the hard left [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4970.26s)]
*  and people on the libertarian right. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4975.740000000001s)]
*  It led me to the conclusion [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4978.660000000001s)]
*  that the ideological spectrum is not a straight line. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4980.34s)]
*  It's a circle, and it meets at a certain point [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4982.9400000000005s)]
*  where civil liberties are concerned. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4985.46s)]
*  I agree. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4987.14s)]
*  And so I started following other people's cases [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4988.3s)]
*  that would never have interested me in the past. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4991.26s)]
*  It was always cases dealing with government overreach, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4994.3s)]
*  like reassessing Ruby Ridge, right? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=4997.34s)]
*  Or Waco. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5002.06s)]
*  I mean- [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5004.06s)]
*  Ruby Ridge was really just absolutely murdered the guys. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5004.900000000001s)]
*  In cold blood. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5007.54s)]
*  Child and his wife shot his dog. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5008.62s)]
*  Randy Weaver because his shotgun was two inches too short [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5012.62s)]
*  or something. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5015.900000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5016.74s)]
*  Lon Hiruchi, I think was the name of the FBI sniper. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5017.62s)]
*  I want to say it again, Lon Hiruchi. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5020.58s)]
*  Murdered them in cold blood. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5022.26s)]
*  Shot a woman, really? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5024.5s)]
*  Yeah, a woman. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5025.54s)]
*  Who's just standing in the door- [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5026.38s)]
*  Holding a baby. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5027.22s)]
*  Holding a baby. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5028.0599999999995s)]
*  That's right. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5030.38s)]
*  Yeah, and that was, and by the way, [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5031.22s)]
*  that was not only never punished, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5033.54s)]
*  Lon Hiruchi was never punished for that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5035.82s)]
*  He should have gone right to prison for murder [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5037.98s)]
*  and his superior should have gone right to prison [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5040.0199999999995s)]
*  for authorizing that murder. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5041.86s)]
*  But it was like, at the time it was like, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5043.5s)]
*  oh, what are you, a Ruby Ridge person? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5046.14s)]
*  Like you care? [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5047.9400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5049.02s)]
*  Like you're a Waco or something? [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5049.860000000001s)]
*  So you're some kind of right-wing extremist. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5050.700000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5052.5s)]
*  If you say- [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5053.34s)]
*  I was a right-wing extremist, so I knew about it [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5054.18s)]
*  and I was really bothered by it. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5056.38s)]
*  Right-wing in the sense that I believed in the Bill of Rights. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5057.700000000001s)]
*  I don't think you should be able to murder women [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5060.5s)]
*  for no reason. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5063.34s)]
*  People began sending me books by John Whitehead [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5065.14s)]
*  and I remember just blowing through these books saying, [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5068.58s)]
*  why have I never heard of this guy before? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5072.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5074.62s)]
*  I mean, he's talking sense here about government overreach. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5076.26s)]
*  He had case after case after case. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5079.179999999999s)]
*  All documented. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5080.82s)]
*  I have that book on my shelf in my office. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5081.86s)]
*  The Government of Wolves. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5083.5s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5084.86s)]
*  But the media, not to blame everything on the media, [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5086.179999999999s)]
*  but it is kind of the mouthpiece of the blob. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5089.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5093.26s)]
*  Yeah, the Praetorian Guard really, the protectors, [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5094.179999999999s)]
*  the bodyguards of the murderers and the liars. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5096.58s)]
*  They just, man, they swarmed anybody who expressed concern [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5099.9s)]
*  about these cases. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5104.46s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5105.74s)]
*  They try to paint you as a radical. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5106.58s)]
*  A conspiracy theorist. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5108.54s)]
*  Conspiracy theorist. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5109.74s)]
*  A term that was created by the CIA, by the way. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5111.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5113.62s)]
*  Shut the man's wife. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5114.66s)]
*  So this, so you, your views, and I should have done a, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5116.46s)]
*  people can Google you and I hope that they will, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5121.26s)]
*  but it's hard to overstate the departure [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5123.66s)]
*  that this turn is from the rest of your life. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5126.34s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5128.54s)]
*  You weren't a CIA paramilitary. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5129.62s)]
*  You were an actual, just like officer. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5131.42s)]
*  Case officer, yeah. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5133.66s)]
*  Case officer. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5134.54s)]
*  Recruiting spies to steal secrets. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5135.38s)]
*  Multilingual, you speak Greek, you speak Arabic, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5137.3s)]
*  which is like considered basically impossible [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5140.26s)]
*  for native English speakers. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5142.26s)]
*  You're a scholar, literally, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5143.22s)]
*  and kind of an academic in some ways, right? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5145.62s)]
*  I'm a professor of intelligence studies now [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5150.0199999999995s)]
*  at the University of Salamanca in Spain, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5152.46s)]
*  and I taught for four years at Liberty University [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5154.82s)]
*  in Lynchburg, Virginia. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5158.5s)]
*  Right. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5159.5s)]
*  And it's funny, when they called me to hire me, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5160.34s)]
*  I said, wow, I'm flattered, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5163.26s)]
*  but you and I probably disagree on 99% of the issues. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5164.42s)]
*  Why would you want me to teach [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5168.62s)]
*  in the Jesse Helms School of Government? [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5170.3s)]
*  And the dean said, because torture's not Christian. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5172.9800000000005s)]
*  It certainly isn't. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5176.14s)]
*  And I said, you know what? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5176.9800000000005s)]
*  I'll take the job. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5177.8s)]
*  Certainly isn't. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5178.64s)]
*  I love those guys. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5179.46s)]
*  And I'm still in touch with them. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5180.3s)]
*  And killing unarmed, defenseless people is immoral. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5181.14s)]
*  It is. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5184.66s)]
*  And it's also just dishonorable in the most secular terms. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5185.5s)]
*  That's right. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5188.06s)]
*  If a man is handcuffed, you don't punch him in the face [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5188.9s)]
*  because it's bad for him, but it also degrades you. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5190.9s)]
*  That's right. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5193.339999999999s)]
*  It does. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5194.179999999999s)]
*  It degrades you. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5195.0s)]
*  It's not how honorable men behave. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5195.839999999999s)]
*  PTSD and moral injury are real. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5196.679999999999s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5199.54s)]
*  We damage ourselves. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5200.5s)]
*  It's so disgusting. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5201.82s)]
*  Like, what is this anyway? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5202.66s)]
*  I mean, I sort of believe that the country was good [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5204.259999999999s)]
*  because it was virtuous, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5207.42s)]
*  and like certain things we don't do, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5208.78s)]

*  We don't torture people who are chained [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5215.099999999999s)]
*  because they can't fight back. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5217.86s)]
*  That's right. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5219.299999999999s)]
*  What is this anyway? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5220.86s)]
*  What is this? [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5221.7s)]
*  And then what happens when you go in and you say, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5222.78s)]
*  oh, I accidentally killed him. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5224.9400000000005s)]
*  Oh, well, just bury him out back. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5226.74s)]
*  That's literally what they did. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5229.54s)]
*  Actually? [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5231.14s)]
*  Just bury him out back, yeah. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5231.9800000000005s)]
*  It's just hard to make a moral case [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5235.22s)]
*  for the things that you're doing when you behave that way. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5237.26s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5240.78s)]
*  And to see once again, [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5241.62s)]
*  the only man who tells the truth face the penalty [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5245.06s)]

*  It is. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5252.94s)]
*  I'm confident things are gonna turn around. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5253.86s)]
*  I think so too. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5255.46s)]
*  I hope so, I pray that. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5256.38s)]
*  So how long were you in prison in the end? [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5257.98s)]
*  23 months. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5260.259999999999s)]
*  I didn't get a single day of halfway house time. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5261.38s)]
*  They made sure that I did every day of that sentence. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5265.96s)]
*  They had to take seven months off for good behavior. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5269.7s)]
*  They had to, because it's legally mandated. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5273.0199999999995s)]
*  But I was in that prison for every last day [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5277.02s)]
*  that they could get out of me. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5279.860000000001s)]
*  Were any elected officials sympathetic at all? [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5281.46s)]
*  Yeah, well, yes, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5289.5s)]
*  but none were really willing to go out on a limb. [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5292.900000000001s)]
*  Gus Belarekis, who's a congressman from Florida, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5297.68s)]
*  he was very supportive and friendly. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5300.42s)]
*  I should add, it wasn't just Gus. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5302.22s)]
*  Gus is a sweetheart of a guy. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5303.9800000000005s)]
*  It was the whole Greek American community. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5306.06s)]
*  What does this say? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5308.06s)]
*  Man, they're cohesive. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5308.900000000001s)]
*  They are, we stick together. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5310.56s)]
*  I'm aware of, yes. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5311.820000000001s)]
*  So they really went to the mat for me. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5313.14s)]
*  I got fantastic press coverage in Greece. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5314.76s)]
*  The Greek government hired me [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5317.46s)]
*  to help them write a new whistleblower protection law [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5319.1s)]
*  when I got out of prison. [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5321.38s)]
*  It was my first trip. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5322.54s)]
*  I had to get permission from the judge to travel [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5323.38s)]
*  because I had just gotten out of prison. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5325.38s)]
*  So that was fun. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5329.02s)]
*  But really, and Jim Moran, [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5330.740000000001s)]
*  who was a Democratic congressman from, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5333.78s)]
*  Jim was very helpful, very, very helpful. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5336.34s)]
*  But that was it, besides the two of them. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5340.219999999999s)]
*  Moran was, I don't even know if he's still alive. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5342.54s)]
*  I knew Moran pretty well. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5344.66s)]
*  Drank too much. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5347.38s)]
*  Florid and wild private life, crazy town. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5349.219999999999s)]
*  And I disagreed with him on all domestic policy issues, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5353.62s)]
*  passionately, because he was very liberal. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5356.34s)]
*  But his foreign policy views were out of the mainstream. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5358.94s)]
*  He was not a neocon. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5363.099999999999s)]
*  And boy, watching the job they did on Jim Moran. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5364.86s)]
*  How many times did they primarily him? [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5369.62s)]
*  Jeremy Bash ran against him, ghouls like that, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5371.46s)]
*  who just like on the merits. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5373.62s)]
*  So Jim Moran seemed like possibly hadn't honored [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5375.46s)]
*  his marriage vows and drank too much. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5378.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, okay. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5380.54s)]
*  And he was like a loud mouth [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5381.7s)]
*  and he was always ready to beat people up. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5382.82s)]
*  He was like this big Irish guy. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5384.46s)]
*  Okay, got it. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5386.54s)]
*  Those are his sins as I understand them. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5387.379999999999s)]
*  The people who were against him had like committed jettison. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5389.5s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5392.06s)]
*  And they were like, it was crazy. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5394.1s)]
*  It was crazy. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5396.46s)]
*  And they systematically destroyed Jim Moran's life [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5397.42s)]
*  for asking like pretty obvious questions [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5402.660000000001s)]
*  like why did 9-11 happen? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5404.580000000001s)]
*  Right, they don't wanna talk about that. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5406.46s)]
*  Shouldn't we know? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5408.3s)]
*  I mean like- You'd think. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5409.14s)]
*  Assuming that it was exactly what they told us it was, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5409.9800000000005s)]
*  which was this group of 19 Arabs, mostly Saudis, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5413.06s)]
*  decided to attack the United States, whatever. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5416.660000000001s)]
*  Let's just say that's true. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5419.14s)]
*  I'm assuming it is true. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5421.26s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5423.54s)]
*  Why were they willing to die for that? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5424.54s)]
*  Like what were they mad about? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5425.900000000001s)]
*  But that's the question. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5426.74s)]
*  What were they mad about? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5427.58s)]
*  That's what Jim Moran asked. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5428.42s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, by the way, Jim Moran. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5429.780000000001s)]
*  And then they like plastered, they Glenn Greenwalled him. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5431.900000000001s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5435.66s)]
*  And they kind of drove him out. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5437.62s)]
*  And I think he lost his seat in the end. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5439.06s)]
*  He retired. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5441.74s)]
*  Oh, he did, okay. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5442.860000000001s)]
*  And he's at a political consulting firm [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5443.7s)]
*  in McLean, Virginia. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5446.9400000000005s)]
*  I ran into him at a conference about a year ago. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5448.02s)]
*  No way. Yeah. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5450.18s)]
*  He's a lovely man. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5452.02s)]
*  He really is. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5452.9800000000005s)]
*  I always secretly liked him. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5453.820000000001s)]
*  I had him on, I interviewed him a lot. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5455.14s)]
*  And he would get, per his ethnic stereotype, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5457.42s)]
*  he'd get like red in the face. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5460.900000000001s)]
*  Spit would come out. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5464.14s)]
*  But I kind of liked him. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5465.26s)]
*  I liked him. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5467.14s)]
*  Sorry, not to. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5469.34s)]
*  And Gus Villaraquis is one of those guys [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5470.26s)]
*  who's just a genuinely nice guy. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5472.860000000001s)]
*  And he's actually, he's quite an accomplished legislator, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5475.58s)]
*  which he doesn't get a lot of credit for, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5478.86s)]
*  but he's a good guy. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5481.58s)]
*  And so, a fellow Greek American needed some help [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5484.7s)]
*  and he was there to help. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5487.62s)]
*  Wow. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5489.7s)]
*  Have you ever had any contact with CIA [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5490.54s)]
*  since you got out of prison? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5492.299999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5494.7s)]
*  Well, not other than sending articles [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5495.58s)]
*  and books in for clearance. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5499.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5501.339999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5502.179999999999s)]
*  When I got out of prison, I finished house arrest. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5503.0199999999995s)]
*  I had 90 days of house arrest. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5506.219999999999s)]
*  And people started calling me, hey, let's meet for lunch [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5508.82s)]
*  or let's have a pizza or whatever. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5511.379999999999s)]
*  And every time I would go to meet them, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5513.9s)]
*  I'd be under surveillance. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5516.0199999999995s)]
*  And the first few times. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5517.62s)]
*  Still? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5518.62s)]
*  Yeah, but from whom? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5519.46s)]
*  It had to be the FBI. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5521.219999999999s)]
*  It could have been the CIA. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5522.86s)]
*  On what basis could they justify surveilling you? [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5524.099999999999s)]
*  They sent you to prison for an ABC interview. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5526.0599999999995s)]
*  And it's done, it's all done. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5528.099999999999s)]
*  I'm just gonna go have a pizza. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5529.62s)]
*  And moreover, by this point, [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5530.86s)]
*  a congressional investigation has confirmed [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5532.46s)]
*  that you were telling the truth. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5535.379999999999s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5536.299999999999s)]
*  And this is just, this is now on Wikipedia. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5537.3s)]
*  But Barack Obama was still in the White House. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5541.1s)]
*  And so the policy hadn't changed. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5544.74s)]
*  I don't think he knew who I was one way or the other. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5546.900000000001s)]
*  I think that Brendan went to him and said, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5549.7s)]
*  there's this very dangerous guy, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5552.06s)]
*  insider threat from the CIA. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5553.7s)]
*  He leaked to the press and Obama just said, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5555.74s)]
*  Vaya con Dios. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5558.9400000000005s)]
*  He's a cold man. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5561.58s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5562.780000000001s)]
*  No, he doesn't care. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5563.66s)]
*  So part of the reason that this has to be precedent, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5564.5s)]
*  they cannot allow a CIA officer to break ranks. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5568.34s)]
*  This is what's very dangerous. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5570.78s)]
*  There actually was a legal precedent [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5572.62s)]
*  that was set in my case. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5574.98s)]
*  And it was one of the things used against President Trump [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5576.22s)]
*  in the documents case. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5582.14s)]
*  I was charged in the Eastern District of Virginia, [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5585.58s)]
*  which is called the espionage court for a couple of reasons. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5588.06s)]
*  No, I'm aware. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5590.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5591.66s)]
*  National security defendant has ever won a case there, ever. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5592.78s)]
*  And it's the home of the Pentagon, the CIA, [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5596.42s)]
*  all the defense contractors. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5599.22s)]
*  So we made a hundred motions to use a hundred classified [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5600.74s)]
*  documents that we received in discovery in my defense. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5609.9s)]
*  And we asked the judge to block off three days [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5613.54s)]
*  to hear our motions. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5616.18s)]
*  And we walked into the courtroom and she says, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5618.1s)]
*  I'm gonna make everybody's day much easier. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5621.7s)]
*  And I'm gonna just deny all 100 of these motions. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5624.74s)]
*  You can't use any of these documents in the case. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5627.86s)]
*  And my lawyer said, your honor, it's our whole defense. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5631.5s)]
*  You're saying that we can't mount a defense. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5635.46s)]
*  And she said, classified is classified. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5638.0199999999995s)]
*  So you can't use the classified documents to defend him. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5640.54s)]
*  So as we were walking out, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5644.82s)]
*  I said to my lawyer, what just happened? [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5647.5s)]
*  And he said, we just lost the case. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5650.1s)]
*  That's what happened. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5651.700000000001s)]
*  And I said, well, now what do we do? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5652.700000000001s)]
*  He said, now we talk about a plea. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5654.26s)]
*  So the government charges you with a death penalty offense [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5655.900000000001s)]
*  and then gets to decide what you can talk about in court? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5659.18s)]
*  In fact, they made a list of words [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5663.3s)]
*  that I wasn't allowed to use in court. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5664.9400000000005s)]
*  Like I could not use the word whistleblower. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5666.9400000000005s)]
*  I had to use the words swimming pool. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5669.660000000001s)]
*  There's a whole list. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5672.46s)]
*  So- [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5673.700000000001s)]
*  Swimming pool? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5674.620000000001s)]
*  Because the word whistleblower in and of itself, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5676.1s)]
*  they deem to be classified. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5679.1s)]
*  And so I couldn't say I'm a whistleblower. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5681.3s)]
*  On what grounds? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5683.740000000001s)]
*  How is it class? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5684.9400000000005s)]
*  They say so. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5685.780000000001s)]
*  The secret word? [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5686.9800000000005s)]
*  So they invoked something called the CIPA, [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5688.54s)]
*  the Classified Information Protection Act. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5691.900000000001s)]
*  So they would clear the courtroom every time I had a hearing. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5694.54s)]
*  They would put plastic tarp over the windows and tape it up [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5697.860000000001s)]
*  so nobody could shoot a laser beam at the window [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5701.860000000001s)]
*  and listen to the vibrations and hear classified information. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5704.22s)]
*  There was the list of banned words like whistleblower. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5707.34s)]
*  Yeah, whistleblower, absurd. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5712.22s)]
*  So the physical security of the United States [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5716.860000000001s)]
*  depended upon you not using the word whistleblower. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5719.5s)]
*  Yeah, that was it. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5721.78s)]
*  And so my lawyer said to the judge, [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5723.62s)]
*  well, the judge said his reason [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5729.18s)]
*  for blowing the whistle is irrelevant. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5733.54s)]
*  The question is, does the intelligence community say [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5736.42s)]
*  that he violated the Espionage Act? [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5739.18s)]
*  The answer is yes. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5740.9800000000005s)]
*  And my lawyer said, Your Honor, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5742.14s)]
*  are you saying that a person can accidentally commit espionage? [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5744.86s)]
*  And she said, that's exactly what I'm saying. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5750.58s)]
*  Who is this judge? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5753.26s)]
*  Her name was Leonie Brinkama. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5754.18s)]
*  She was a Clinton appointee. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5755.78s)]
*  Was she not bright or was she just so committed [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5758.7s)]
*  to the status quo, to the intel community? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5763.5s)]
*  She's committed. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5765.62s)]
*  She reserves every national security case for herself. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5766.46s)]
*  They're supposed to go into a wheel, right? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5768.86s)]
*  And be chosen randomly. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5770.78s)]
*  She had Julian Assange. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5772.46s)]
*  She had the Ed Snowden case, which never came. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5773.98s)]
*  She had my case. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5776.42s)]
*  She had Jeffrey Sterling, another CIA whistleblower. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5777.34s)]
*  Every national security, she had Zacharias Musawi, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5780.22s)]
*  the 20th hijacker. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5783.0599999999995s)]
*  So she reserves these cases for herself [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5785.0599999999995s)]
*  and everybody gets the maximum. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5786.9s)]
*  So she said in response to my attorney, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5789.26s)]
*  that- [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5794.18s)]
*  She sounds like a scary person. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5795.02s)]
*  Oh, she was terrifying. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5795.860000000001s)]
*  That the definition of whistle, [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5797.9400000000005s)]
*  first she said, I'm not respecting a precedent set [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5800.34s)]
*  in the federal district of Maryland. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5802.58s)]
*  She's not respecting it in the Tom Drake case, [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5805.3s)]
*  where the judge ruled that there had to be some harm [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5808.02s)]
*  to the national security. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5811.3s)]
*  There was no harm in my case. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5812.54s)]
*  Nobody was harmed, literally. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5814.42s)]
*  The name that I confirmed was never made public, never. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5816.38s)]
*  So nobody was harmed. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5821.22s)]
*  So she says the definition- [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5823.34s)]
*  And actually you were speaking out against harm. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5826.7s)]
*  Yeah, I was speaking out against harm. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5828.820000000001s)]
*  She says the definition of espionage [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5830.46s)]
*  is providing national defense information [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5833.9400000000005s)]
*  to any person not entitled to receive it, period. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5836.62s)]
*  So- [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5842.18s)]
*  That's espionage? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5843.02s)]
*  In her view- [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5844.74s)]
*  I mean, it may be illegal, but it's not. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5845.9800000000005s)]
*  Espionage is spying- [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5848.26s)]
*  For a foreign country. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5850.820000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5852.22s)]
*  Daniel Ellsberg called me. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5853.58s)]
*  He and I became very close friends over this whole thing. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5854.860000000001s)]
*  And he said, I'm gonna ask you to do something [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5858.38s)]
*  that's completely selfless. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5861.26s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you to go to trial [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5863.62s)]
*  because we can only challenge the constitutionality [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5866.22s)]
*  of the Espionage Act if somebody goes to trial [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5869.46s)]
*  and is convicted. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5872.14s)]
*  I said, Dan, I have five kids. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5873.02s)]
*  I can't go to trial. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5875.54s)]
*  So he asked Jeffrey Sterling to do it. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5878.14s)]
*  Jeffrey did go to trial, was convicted. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5880.1s)]
*  The judge saw that this conviction was kind of trumped up. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5882.9400000000005s)]
*  And so he was convicted of nine felonies, [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5886.740000000001s)]
*  including seven counts of espionage. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5889.34s)]
*  And to use her words, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5891.42s)]
*  I'm giving you Kiriakou plus 12 months. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5892.780000000001s)]
*  That's what she said at sentencing. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5896.740000000001s)]
*  I'm giving you Kiriakou plus 12 months. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5898.42s)]
*  Who is he alleged to have spied for? [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5900.46s)]
*  No one. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5903.5s)]
*  He gave an interview to the New York Times [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5904.34s)]
*  about the racial discrimination suit [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5908.3s)]
*  that he had filed against the CIA. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5912.860000000001s)]
*  They passed him over for a promotion [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5915.620000000001s)]
*  just because he was black. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5917.5s)]
*  And then they had the temerity to tell him, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5919.26s)]
*  we're not promoting you because you're black. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5922.18s)]
*  And he said, when did you realize I was black? [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5925.42s)]
*  The irony is that there's a lot of espionage in Washington. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5930.38s)]
*  Apparently, yeah. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5933.540000000001s)]
*  Well, there is. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5934.9800000000005s)]
*  Every intelligence service in the world [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5936.299999999999s)]
*  has its officers in Washington. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5938.9s)]
*  There are also people who work for the US government [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5940.54s)]
*  who, without any kind of authorization, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5942.66s)]
*  give highly relevant classified information [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5945.82s)]
*  to foreign governments. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5949.0199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5950.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5950.9s)]
*  Every day. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5951.74s)]
*  I know that for a fact, and I know people who've done it. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5952.58s)]
*  And none of them is in jail. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5955.74s)]
*  No. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5957.34s)]

*  None of them is in jail. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5960.179999999999s)]
*  And it's also fair to say the US government [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5961.139999999999s)]
*  is penetrated by foreign actors. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5963.18s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5966.3s)]
*  Yes. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5967.14s)]
*  And it has been for a long time. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5967.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, I'm aware. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5969.34s)]
*  And I don't think anyone goes to jail for that. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5971.820000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5974.06s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5974.900000000001s)]
*  You know, I tried a couple of times [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5975.740000000001s)]
*  to get a pardon under Presidents Obama [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5978.06s)]
*  and Biden, thinking that most of my contacts [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5983.06s)]
*  in the Greek American community [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5987.26s)]
*  had access to those presidents. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5989.26s)]
*  I was laughed out of the room under Obama, [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5990.9s)]
*  and I knew I would be. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5993.98s)]
*  Under Biden, there's a Greek Orthodox priest [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=5996.58s)]
*  who very generously offered his access to the White House. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6000.86s)]
*  Can I just note parenthetically, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6005.98s)]
*  I don't think there are a lot of Greek liberals left. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6008.78s)]
*  No, there aren't. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6010.82s)]
*  There used to be. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6011.66s)]
*  There used to be. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6012.5s)]
*  They used to be almost all liberals. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6013.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6014.62s)]
*  And they've all moved. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6015.46s)]
*  I've noticed. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6016.299999999999s)]
*  I don't think I've met a Greek liberal in a long time. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6017.58s)]
*  No, they're just not out there anymore. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6020.14s)]
*  So he said, look, I've known Biden since the early 70s. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6022.780000000001s)]
*  I can help you. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6025.9800000000005s)]
*  And then nothing. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6027.820000000001s)]
*  And I called him and I said, father, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6029.62s)]
*  forgive me for being so blunt, [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6031.700000000001s)]
*  but maybe if I had been a crackhead relative [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6033.34s)]
*  of the president or a Chinese spy [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6037.02s)]
*  or a judge that sold children into bondage in Pennsylvania, [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6040.5s)]
*  maybe then I would have had a chance. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6045.900000000001s)]
*  But Joe Biden doesn't want to hear about a case like mine. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6048.92s)]
*  And the truth is, and I mentioned this to you yesterday, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6052.72s)]
*  my support comes exclusively from the Republican Party, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6056.56s)]
*  the Libertarian Movement, and the Conservative Movement. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6062.52s)]
*  And I embrace it. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6066.36s)]
*  People like- [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6068.04s)]
*  That's just wild though. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6068.88s)]
*  Because they're the ones thinking [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6069.72s)]
*  about civil liberties now. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6071.52s)]
*  They're the ones thinking about individual freedoms. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6073.6s)]
*  You know, what's his name? [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6077.42s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries the other day said, [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6079.78s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is an avowed enemy of the United States. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6083.94s)]
*  No, he's not. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6088.38s)]
*  That's a neocon position. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6089.58s)]
*  When did he take a vow? [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6091.5s)]
*  He said he was an avowed enemy. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6093.7s)]
*  When did he take a vow that he was gonna be an enemy [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6095.94s)]
*  of the United States? [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6098.26s)]
*  No. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6099.26s)]
*  Stop trying to lie us into a war or trick us into a war. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6100.18s)]
*  But that's today's Democratic Party. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6104.4800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6106.14s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, the kind of casual cruelty [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6111.860000000001s)]
*  and violence in the CIA that you describe, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6116.26s)]
*  I haven't seen any meaningful attempt to stop it. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6120.02s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no, no, I agree. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6122.58s)]
*  Very strongly. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6125.38s)]
*  Do you believe that the CIA [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6126.58s)]
*  has hurt other American citizens? [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6129.22s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6131.740000000001s)]
*  I'm sure of it. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6132.900000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6134.780000000001s)]
*  Physically. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6135.62s)]
*  Well, there are two very well-documented cases [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6137.46s)]
*  where Barack Obama used a drone to murder Anwar Al-Aqai. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6139.9s)]
*  Yep. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6145.14s)]
*  And whether you like the man's politics or not, [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6145.98s)]
*  he was an American citizen [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6148.0199999999995s)]
*  who had never been charged with a crime. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6150.18s)]
*  And then a week later, Obama drone his 16-year-old son [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6153.18s)]
*  and 14-year-old nephew who were sitting in a coffee shop [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6157.58s)]
*  having a cup of tea. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6161.66s)]
*  Also, American citizens who had never been charged [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6163.86s)]
*  with a crime and they were children. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6166.66s)]
*  So yeah, the CIA does all kinds of things like that. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6169.58s)]
*  What about domestically? [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6171.78s)]
*  Well, you know, I keep thinking back [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6173.46s)]
*  to Eric Holder's testimony [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6177.339999999999s)]
*  before the Senate Armed Services Committee [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6179.66s)]
*  when Rand Paul asked him, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6182.259999999999s)]
*  does the president have the legal authority [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6184.139999999999s)]
*  to murder an American on US soil? [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6187.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, Senator, you know, just answer the question. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6190.82s)]
*  Say yes or no question. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6194.58s)]
*  Yes, he has the authority. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6196.5s)]
*  Now, has he done that? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6199.22s)]
*  We didn't know. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6201.0199999999995s)]
*  But the attorney general of the United States [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6202.22s)]
*  said that the president can murder an American citizen [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6204.34s)]
*  in the United States if the president believes [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6209.22s)]
*  that he presents a clear and present danger [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6212.66s)]
*  to the national security. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6214.74s)]
*  That's sick. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6216.78s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6218.22s)]
*  It's anti-constitutional. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6219.1s)]
*  Not just unconstitutional, it's anti-constitutional. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6221.820000000001s)]
*  Do people who work at the CIA have a sense [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6225.06s)]
*  that maybe they're not serving good? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6227.26s)]
*  Generally, no. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6230.740000000001s)]
*  Generally, these are, I mean, at the working level, [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6233.1s)]
*  these are hardworking, really smart, patriotic people. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6237.54s)]
*  Some of them are really smart, I can confirm that. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6241.34s)]
*  Really smart. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6243.22s)]
*  At the upper levels, you know, they believe [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6245.06s)]
*  they're the smartest people in the room, [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6249.22s)]
*  they're smarter than whoever happens to be president [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6251.5s)]
*  at any given time, and if they don't like this president, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6253.740000000001s)]
*  eh, they just wait him out. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6256.780000000001s)]
*  He'll be gone in four years, they'll still be there [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6258.26s)]
*  in their still senior positions, [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6260.740000000001s)]
*  and they're gonna do exactly what they wanna do. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6262.5s)]
*  You know, this is why they panicked when Ronald Reagan [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6264.620000000001s)]
*  named an outsider as the deputy director for operations. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6268.9400000000005s)]
*  Remember? [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6273.26s)]
*  Do I remember? [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6274.14s)]
*  They lost it. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6274.9800000000005s)]
*  Because they were like, oh my God, okay, [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6276.5s)]
*  you appoint your campaign manager, the director, [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6278.14s)]
*  that's one thing, but now operations, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6281.46s)]
*  you're gonna bring a friend from Wall Street [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6283.66s)]
*  or wherever he was, he was an attorney? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6285.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I would. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6287.74s)]
*  I think that's when they called in Bob Woodward [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6289.78s)]
*  to blow them up, right? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6291.5s)]
*  The former naval intel officer Bob Woodward. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6293.14s)]
*  Oh, I'll tell ya. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6295.54s)]
*  Not the only time Bob Woodward has been called in [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6296.7s)]
*  by the national security state to destroy Americans. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6298.74s)]
*  When I was the executive assistant [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6302.46s)]
*  to the deputy director for operations, [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6305.299999999999s)]
*  I had just finished writing a cable. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6307.38s)]
*  I had this lovely private office, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6309.139999999999s)]
*  and it looked out past the secretary into the hallway. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6311.0599999999995s)]
*  So I finished writing, and I leaned back like this [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6314.42s)]
*  in my chair, and I happened to be looking at the hall, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6317.139999999999s)]
*  and Bob Woodward walked by. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6320.099999999999s)]
*  And I said to the secretary, [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6322.66s)]
*  was that Bob Woodward that just walked by the office? [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6325.0599999999995s)]
*  And she said, yeah. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6327.7s)]
*  And I said, without a security escort, [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6329.179999999999s)]
*  like he owns the place. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6331.26s)]
*  And she said, you didn't see the memo? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6333.06s)]
*  I said, what memo? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6335.3s)]
*  She said, George, George Tennant. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6336.820000000001s)]
*  She said, George sent a memo saying that [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6338.66s)]
*  Woodward's writing a book, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6340.820000000001s)]
*  and we're all ordered to cooperate with him. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6341.820000000001s)]
*  I said, I'm not talking to Bob Woodward. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6344.1s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6348.46s)]
*  He's just a great reporter. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6349.3s)]
*  Come on, John. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6350.9400000000005s)]
*  He's free to walk around. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6351.860000000001s)]
*  That's called shoe leather. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6352.7s)]
*  You're talking about people that have been undercover [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6354.26s)]
*  or deep cover for decades, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6356.14s)]
*  and he's just walking the halls. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6358.26s)]
*  He's not an instrument of the government. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6359.62s)]
*  He's a counterbalance. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6361.82s)]
*  He's a check against their overreach. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6363.5s)]
*  He's a journalist. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6366.099999999999s)]
*  They're gonna run with that. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6367.3s)]
*  It's so absurd. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6368.38s)]
*  I was shocked. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6371.0199999999995s)]
*  What did you think of Bill Burns? [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6373.7s)]
*  I wrote an op-ed when Bill Burns was appointed. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6376.54s)]
*  Former ambassador to Russia. [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6379.82s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6381.9s)]
*  And then up until January, the CIA director. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6382.98s)]
*  I said that I disagreed with his position on Russia, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6386.5s)]
*  as I think every free-thinking American should, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6390.5s)]
*  but we needed an outsider in that job. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6395.3s)]
*  Having insiders is a mistake. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6400.46s)]
*  Obama proved that. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6404.5s)]
*  Having insiders, Clinton proved that. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6405.86s)]
*  It's just a mistake. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6408.26s)]
*  It's incestuous, and they feed on each other. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6409.82s)]
*  So you needed an outsider. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6413.38s)]
*  Bill Burns was one of the most highly respected ambassadors [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6415.42s)]
*  that we had in the State Department. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6418.1s)]
*  Yes, that is true. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6419.3s)]
*  And I called him the adult in the room, [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6420.14s)]
*  and I thought, if we have to have a Washington insider [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6423.14s)]
*  in that position, he was a good choice. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6429.38s)]
*  Yep. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6432.1s)]
*  That sounds right from everything I know about him. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6432.9400000000005s)]
*  When you worked there, did anyone ever talk about [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6436.54s)]
*  the murder of the president in 1963? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6440.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6444.38s)]
*  Oliver Stone and I got into quite a spirited argument [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6447.26s)]
*  about this one time, because I made the mistake of saying [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6449.900000000001s)]
*  that I didn't think we had given enough thought [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6455.34s)]
*  to the possible involvement of Santo Tropicante and the mob. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6457.62s)]
*  And he said, oh, you're so full of shit, he says, [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6467.22s)]
*  and he started yelling at me. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6469.78s)]
*  I came to my own conclusion. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6471.22s)]
*  I talked to Bobby Kennedy about this too. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6475.780000000001s)]
*  Actually, he's the one that pushed me over the edge [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6477.780000000001s)]
*  and led me to this conclusion. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6480.34s)]
*  I believe that elements of the CIA were responsible [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6484.34s)]
*  for the assassination of the president. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6488.62s)]
*  I don't agree when people say it was a CIA operation, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6491.3s)]
*  because John McCone was the head of the CIA, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6494.9800000000005s)]
*  and he was Bobby Kennedy's best friend. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6497.06s)]
*  A name forgotten to history. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6499.94s)]
*  That's right, and a good and decent man. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6501.219999999999s)]
*  But there were a lot of people, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6504.5s)]
*  unfortunately one was a Greek American, who- [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6507.46s)]
*  Very famously. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6510.9s)]
*  Very famous Greek American, his name does not bear repeating, [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6512.259999999999s)]
*  who hated John Kennedy for not providing air cover [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6517.339999999999s)]
*  for the Bay of Pigs and wanted revenge against Kennedy. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6522.099999999999s)]
*  And these guys were still in constant touch [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6525.9s)]
*  with the Dulles brothers, [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6529.9400000000005s)]
*  who were also just dark stains on American history. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6530.78s)]
*  And so I came to the conclusion that, yeah, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6534.26s)]
*  there were CIA officers who were responsible [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6537.78s)]
*  for carrying this thing out. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6540.62s)]
*  Did you think that when you worked there? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6541.46s)]
*  No, I didn't. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6543.02s)]
*  In fact, I thought it was so absurd, [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6544.54s)]
*  I couldn't believe people were even talking about it. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6546.14s)]
*  Really? [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6548.38s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6549.22s)]
*  It's like, we're the good guys. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6550.22s)]
*  Why would we kill the president? [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6552.06s)]
*  I thought the same. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6553.38s)]
*  Why haven't all the files been released? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6555.82s)]
*  I genuinely don't know. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6560.42s)]
*  For JFK, I think they have been. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6562.5s)]
*  No, they have not. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6565.3s)]
*  They have not. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6566.14s)]
*  No. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6566.9800000000005s)]
*  That frightens me. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6567.82s)]
*  There were a couple of explosive revelations [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6569.58s)]
*  in the last tranche. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6572.9400000000005s)]
*  The fact that James Angleton, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6575.34s)]
*  the Deputy Director for Counterintelligence, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6577.26s)]
*  wanted to recruit, to formally recruit Lee Harvey Oswald, [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6579.7s)]
*  is exactly the opposite of what the CIA has been telling us [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6584.7s)]
*  for so many years, for 60 years. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6589.02s)]
*  Why? [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6592.620000000001s)]
*  If the Russians came to the conclusion [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6594.780000000001s)]
*  that he was just a nut when he was living in Minsk [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6597.860000000001s)]
*  and didn't want him to come back, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6601.1s)]
*  why was the CIA involved, or interested rather, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6603.38s)]
*  in recruiting him? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6606.34s)]
*  What was he doing in Mexico City in October of 1963? [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6609.9800000000005s)]
*  He said, or not he said, but the CIA has said over the years [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6615.5s)]
*  that he was there to go to the Cuban and Soviet embassies [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6619.3s)]
*  to try to get visas. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6621.74s)]
*  Why was he meeting with Americans? [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6623.62s)]
*  And were those American CIA officers? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6625.42s)]
*  Of course they were. [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6627.86s)]
*  Why else would he have gone to Mexico City? [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6629.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6631.34s)]
*  I'm actually more interested in the RFK and the MLK documents. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6632.74s)]
*  There is so much that we don't know about those two, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6638.3s)]
*  especially RFK. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6641.94s)]
*  They recovered one more bullet [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6644.22s)]
*  than Sirhan Sirhan's gun held. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6647.26s)]
*  And Thomas Noguchi. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6651.38s)]
*  And this is confirmed. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6652.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6654.02s)]
*  And Thomas Noguchi. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6654.860000000001s)]
*  Well, then that's kind of case closed. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6655.9800000000005s)]
*  There it is. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6658.42s)]
*  Right, I mean, we don't know what happened. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6659.42s)]
*  We know the official explanation is untrue. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6661.38s)]
*  It's untrue. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6663.26s)]
*  So it's- [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6664.42s)]
*  Because it was a revolver, it was a 22 caliber revolver. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6665.26s)]
*  Correct. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6667.54s)]
*  It's like a nine shot. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6668.38s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6669.22s)]
*  22s fit a lot in the cylinder. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6670.06s)]
*  Is that, I did not know that. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6673.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6675.3s)]
*  And Thomas Noguchi, the coroner said that the death shot [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6676.14s)]
*  came from behind at an angle from down on the ground. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6680.54s)]
*  But Sirhan was in front of him. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6686.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6687.900000000001s)]
*  There was a security guard there [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6689.42s)]
*  who was not associated with the Kennedy campaign [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6692.14s)]
*  or with the- [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6694.74s)]
*  Ambassador Hotel. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6696.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, the Ambassador Hotel named Caesar. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6697.820000000001s)]
*  He was a well-known racist and white supremacist. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6701.7s)]
*  On video, you see him lifting a gun out of his belt [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6707.54s)]
*  and then you hear bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6711.66s)]
*  And he puts it back in the belt. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6714.0199999999995s)]
*  He never got it fully out. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6715.5s)]
*  In the 90s, the National Geographic Channel [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6717.38s)]
*  tracked him down to Mississippi or Alabama or something. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6720.259999999999s)]
*  And they interviewed him. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6724.74s)]
*  And they said, did you shoot Robert Kennedy? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6726.0199999999995s)]
*  And he said, no, I was going to, [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6728.42s)]
*  but that Arab fella got him first. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6731.06s)]
*  Well, we know that there had to be somebody else [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6734.18s)]
*  in the kitchen at the Ambassador. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6736.82s)]
*  And we know that the shot came from behind. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6739.900000000001s)]
*  We know that there was a second gun [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6742.66s)]
*  because there were too many bullets. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6744.3s)]
*  So why hasn't this been released? [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6747.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, and it raises the really obvious question, [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6750.3s)]
*  which was, I mean, we know Sirhan had a gun. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6753.74s)]
*  Fired the gun. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6757.98s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6758.82s)]
*  Fired the film. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6759.66s)]
*  Correct. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6760.5s)]
*  Lots of people there, including lots of famous people, [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6761.34s)]
*  Rosie Greer. [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6763.3s)]
*  Rosie Greer, yeah. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6764.14s)]
*  Right, so Kennedy had just won the California primary. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6765.26s)]
*  Johnson had announced a few months before [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6768.62s)]
*  that he's not running. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6770.34s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy clearly is going to be the Democratic nominee. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6771.7s)]
*  He's murdered that night after his victory speech, [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6775.3s)]
*  walking through the kitchen of this [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6778.26s)]
*  now demolished hotel in Los Angeles. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6779.62s)]
*  Sirhan Sirhan, a Christian Palestinian [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6782.78s)]
*  from a very poor family, was arrested for it. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6786.02s)]
*  His apartment is searched, [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6789.660000000001s)]
*  and there are all kinds of papers where he writes, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6790.900000000001s)]
*  RFK must die, RFK must die over and over again. [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6793.5s)]
*  What would, he has said, he's still alive, by the way. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6797.38s)]
*  Oh yeah, and still in prison. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6800.34s)]
*  Yes, he is. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6801.740000000001s)]
*  And I mean, that was before I was born and I'm 56. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6802.700000000001s)]
*  So it was quite some time ago. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6805.46s)]
*  What was that? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6808.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, that's the $64,000 question. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6810.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6814.46s)]
*  Because now there are rumors that when he was at, [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6815.58s)]
*  whatever it's called, Los Angeles Community College, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6823.26s)]
*  or whatever the community college there was, [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6825.78s)]
*  that he may have participated in experiments [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6828.5s)]
*  that fell under a CIA operation then known as MKUltra. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6832.74s)]
*  Yes. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6836.74s)]
*  So what's the truth? [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6838.26s)]
*  Now, Director Helms, during the Nixon administration, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6839.9s)]
*  or during, I guess it was the Ford administration, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6845.5s)]
*  ordered that the MKUltra documents be destroyed. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6847.74s)]
*  Which they were. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6850.339999999999s)]
*  Which they were. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6851.179999999999s)]
*  After being specifically told it's a crime [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6852.9s)]
*  to destroy federal documents. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6856.0599999999995s)]
*  And they don't belong to you. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6857.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6858.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6859.5s)]
*  Do you think it's, and this is a debate about, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6860.7s)]
*  a lot of different people in Lewis Jolin West [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6864.46s)]
*  and the CIA affiliated psychiatrist. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6867.219999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6870.259999999999s)]
*  Do you think it is possible to get people to commit acts [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6871.42s)]
*  that they wouldn't otherwise commit? [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6877.18s)]
*  I do. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6879.9800000000005s)]
*  You do? [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6880.82s)]
*  I do. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6881.66s)]
*  You said there were a lot of shrinks at CIA. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6882.5s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6884.42s)]
*  There are offices where everybody is either a psychiatrist [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6885.7s)]
*  or a psychologist. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6889.9800000000005s)]
*  And they're operational psychiatrists and psychologists. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6890.9400000000005s)]
*  So you take them with you on an operation [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6894.14s)]
*  to consult with them on how do you get this guy to crack? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6896.46s)]
*  You want him to just lose his mind. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6898.900000000001s)]
*  What do I need to do to push this guy over the edge? [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6900.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6902.78s)]
*  Or what do I need to do to convince this guy [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6903.62s)]
*  to do something that he definitely doesn't want to do? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6905.02s)]
*  I used those shrinks on operations. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6908.18s)]
*  We even hypnotized one guy. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6911.26s)]
*  He was hypnotized with his arm in the air for two hours. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6913.34s)]
*  Never saw anything like it in my life. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6916.02s)]
*  And then when he took him out of the hypnosis, [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6917.46s)]
*  his arm fell down. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6919.900000000001s)]
*  He looked around. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6921.06s)]
*  He said, what happened? [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6921.900000000001s)]
*  And then he vomited. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6922.9400000000005s)]
*  I've never seen anything like it in my life. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6924.5s)]
*  So people- [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6926.9800000000005s)]
*  Did it work? [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6928.02s)]
*  It did work. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6929.1s)]
*  We asked him, I'm getting a little off the subject, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6930.9800000000005s)]
*  but we asked him about a- [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6934.66s)]
*  No, this is definitely the subject. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6935.9400000000005s)]
*  A political assassination that had taken place [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6937.14s)]
*  that he had claimed to see. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6939.74s)]
*  So the guy didn't speak any English. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6942.9400000000005s)]
*  So the shrink is asking questions [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6947.34s)]
*  and I'm translating the questions as softly [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6949.9400000000005s)]
*  and as gently as I can. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6952.74s)]
*  Into Arabic. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6954.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6955.54s)]
*  And I'm asking him, what did you see? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6956.82s)]
*  Well, the guy had stopped at a mosque, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6959.94s)]
*  at this little small roadside mosque to relieve himself. [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6963.94s)]
*  So he's behind a tree and a car pulls up [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6968.58s)]
*  and it's these people who had been identified [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6974.179999999999s)]
*  as the shooters in an assassination [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6976.86s)]
*  that had just taken place. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6979.54s)]
*  And I said, so describe the guys. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6981.42s)]
*  And he's describing what they're wearing. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6983.7s)]
*  And I said, what kind of car are they driving? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6985.78s)]
*  They're driving a van. [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6987.86s)]
*  I said, does the van have a license plate? [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6989.58s)]
*  He said, yes. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6992.5s)]
*  I said, can you see the license plate? [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6993.58s)]
*  And he goes, his eyes are closed and he goes like this. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6995.9s)]
*  And then he reads off the numbers and letters to me. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=6999.34s)]
*  So I hand it to another officer that was in the room, [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7002.7s)]
*  runs into the next room, [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7007.14s)]
*  does a cable to the country, intelligence service. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7010.42s)]
*  It comes back, stolen plates. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7015.78s)]
*  I said, my God, he actually did see the plates. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7019.98s)]
*  The plates were stolen specifically for use [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7023.0599999999995s)]
*  in that assassination. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7025.78s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7027.94s)]
*  So you can convince people to do things [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7028.78s)]
*  that they otherwise would never dream of. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7032.1s)]
*  So mind control is not a sci-fi fantasy. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7034.0199999999995s)]
*  No, no. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7037.62s)]
*  MKUltra did far, far more damage, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7039.42s)]
*  caused just grief and misery to hundreds of people, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7043.38s)]
*  maybe more. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7049.14s)]
*  And there are subsets like MKChickwit [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7050.34s)]
*  and there are like five or six other sub operations [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7053.5s)]
*  that were part of MKUltra that just caused people [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7057.34s)]
*  to jump out of windows and commit suicide, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7061.34s)]
*  jump off bridges. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7064.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, the defense secretary did. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7066.26s)]
*  Yeah, he did. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7067.66s)]
*  James Forrestal. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7068.54s)]
*  Yep, committed suicide. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7069.46s)]
*  But sure he did. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7072.5s)]
*  That's quite an amazing story. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7075.3s)]
*  I don't think that's on Wikipedia. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7077.54s)]
*  No. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7078.98s)]
*  So, but I would encourage people to look into that [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7079.82s)]
*  because that is definitely worth knowing about. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7083.46s)]
*  Is it possible to infect people with cancer? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7086.46s)]
*  Not while I was there. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7090.7s)]
*  People talked about it a lot, but- [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7092.06s)]
*  They talked about it a lot. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7093.98s)]
*  Yeah, like, do you think it's possible? [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7094.9s)]
*  Can we do it? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7096.7s)]
*  I mean, if we could do it, what would we do with it? [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7097.58s)]
*  This is something that the Venezuelan government [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7101.34s)]
*  and the Cuban government have both accused us of doing. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7104.18s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7106.66s)]
*  And many governments around the world [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7108.42s)]
*  believe that that is real. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7109.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7111.78s)]
*  Now, remember, I left 20 years ago. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7112.62s)]
*  So who knows? [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7115.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7117.38s)]
*  Would you describe the CIA [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7121.1s)]
*  as an intelligence gathering agency? [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7122.1s)]
*  Not anymore, no. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7124.54s)]
*  It used to be. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7126.3s)]
*  The deputy director for whom I worked [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7127.82s)]
*  was very fond of saying, and he used to say this all the time, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7130.1s)]
*  the job of the CIA is to recruit spies, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7132.74s)]
*  to steal secrets, and to analyze those secrets [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7135.62s)]
*  so that our policymakers can make the best informed policy. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7138.62s)]
*  Okay, so I thought that was the whole idea [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7141.9s)]
*  behind creating the agency, right there. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7145.22s)]
*  Yes, that was it, until 9-11. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7147.3s)]
*  And then it became a paramilitary organization. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7150.5s)]
*  You know, the director gave a speech the other day [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7154.0599999999995s)]
*  in which he said that we need to focus [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7156.62s)]
*  on human-source intelligence. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7158.099999999999s)]
*  True. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7159.82s)]
*  Every director says that when he becomes the director. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7161.26s)]
*  But the truth is, what they would rather do [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7163.86s)]
*  is fancy high-tech science stuff. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7167.299999999999s)]
*  Satellites and drones and computer intrusions [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7171.58s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7176.259999999999s)]
*  They're not really in the business anymore [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7177.42s)]
*  of recruiting spies to steal secrets. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7179.82s)]
*  They should be, but they're not. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7181.86s)]
*  It's not directly related, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7184.5s)]
*  but we know, because it's public information, [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7185.62s)]
*  that somebody bet big against United Airlines [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7188.179999999999s)]
*  and American Airlines right before 9-11. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7192.26s)]
*  So people knew it was coming. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7195.34s)]
*  Other people who planned it knew it was coming. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7196.34s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7198.06s)]
*  Do you think that those bets, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7199.54s)]
*  those stock bets shorting those airlines, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7204.780000000001s)]
*  that Al-Qaeda did that? [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7209.1s)]
*  No, I don't think Al-Qaeda did it. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7211.22s)]
*  I think that- [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7213.46s)]
*  In other words, who else knew it was coming? [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7215.42s)]
*  I think there were intelligence services out there, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7217.34s)]
*  foreign intelligence services, that knew it was coming. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7219.3s)]
*  But it was in their interests for the US to be at war. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7222.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that's where this came from. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7227.9400000000005s)]
*  Did you think that when you worked there? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7230.14s)]
*  No. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7234.14s)]
*  And I'll tell you why. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7235.5s)]
*  On July 6th, 2001, totally normal day, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7237.06s)]
*  I was entertaining a group [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7244.06s)]
*  of Middle Eastern intelligence officers, [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7245.3s)]
*  which we did every day. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7247.9400000000005s)]
*  They come in, we do a day of briefings, [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7249.26s)]
*  they get a photo op with the director, [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7252.54s)]
*  and then we take them out to a- [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7253.54s)]
*  This is Ad Langley. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7254.38s)]
*  Yes, Ad Langley. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7255.46s)]
*  So I had this group of Arabs that day, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7256.82s)]
*  and I had gone to this very young junior analyst [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7259.46s)]
*  on Al-Qaeda at the Counterterrorism Center. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7264.5s)]
*  And I said, hey, I've got this delegation, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7268.78s)]
*  can you come in and give us 30 minutes on Al-Qaeda? [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7270.299999999999s)]
*  He said, sure. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7272.66s)]
*  So it comes time for the briefing, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7274.139999999999s)]
*  and instead of this junior analyst showing up, [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7276.219999999999s)]
*  Kofor Black shows up with the chief of operations- [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7278.5s)]
*  And who's Kofor Black? [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7281.94s)]
*  Kofor Black was the director [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7282.78s)]
*  of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7283.9800000000005s)]
*  later ambassador of Kofor Black. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7285.86s)]
*  He was the special coordinator for Counterterrorism [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7287.66s)]
*  at the State Department. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7290.42s)]
*  Then he went on to Blackwater and Great Wealth. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7291.54s)]
*  So I jumped up and I said, oh, I said, gentlemen, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7295.3s)]
*  this is Kofor Black, [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7299.82s)]
*  he's the director of the Counterterrorism Center, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7301.22s)]
*  and this is the chief of operations [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7303.46s)]
*  for the Osama bin Laden group called Alec Station. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7305.02s)]
*  And I mean, I had no idea why somebody as important [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7309.1s)]
*  and as busy as Kofor would come in. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7313.46s)]
*  He sits down and he says, he starts off by saying, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7315.9s)]
*  something terrible is going to happen. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7319.54s)]
*  We don't know exactly when or where, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7322.42s)]
*  but we're hearing communications from Al-Qaeda [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7325.54s)]
*  that tell us that something big [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7328.74s)]
*  that we've never seen before is going to happen. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7332.22s)]
*  We're hearing code words for a huge attack. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7335.1s)]
*  The honey salesman is coming with vast quantities of honey. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7339.22s)]
*  There's going to be an enormous wedding. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7341.9800000000005s)]
*  There's going to be a great football match. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7344.3s)]
*  We're hearing Al-Qaeda camp commanders on the phone [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7346.7s)]
*  with their students and they're crying [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7350.02s)]
*  and saying, I'll see you in paradise. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7352.22s)]
*  He said, we have no idea when and where [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7355.22s)]
*  this attack is going to come. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7357.78s)]
*  He said, I'm begging you, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7359.5s)]
*  if you have any sources inside Al-Qaeda, please help us. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7361.74s)]
*  And they just kind of sat there and looked at each other [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7367.54s)]
*  and he got up and he shook their hands and walked out. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7369.82s)]
*  So at the end of the day, I'm thinking about this all day. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7373.46s)]
*  At the end of the day, I send them back to their hotel. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7376.42s)]
*  I said, I'll pick you up at the hotel. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7379.58s)]
*  I'll take you to dinner. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7381.26s)]
*  But I went back to Kofor's office and I said, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7382.62s)]
*  I said, Kofor, I wanted to thank you [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7384.66s)]
*  for coming and talking to those guys, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7385.78s)]
*  but I have to ask, were you serious [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7387.26s)]
*  or was that for their benefit? [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7390.3s)]
*  And he said, oh, I'm dead serious. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7392.38s)]
*  Something terrible is going to happen. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7394.5s)]
*  And then it happened. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7397.42s)]
*  On the morning of September 11th, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7399.26s)]
*  Kofor and I had a meeting scheduled with Condoleezza Rice [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7401.66s)]
*  for the stupidest idea, now in retrospect. [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7405.78s)]
*  The government printing office was going to print [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7409.179999999999s)]
*  a volume of declassified cables called [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7413.58s)]
*  Foreign Policy of the United States, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7417.0199999999995s)]
*  1949 to 1967, Greece, Turkey, Cyprus. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7419.98s)]
*  Nobody's ever going to read this thing, right? [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7424.98s)]
*  Not one person. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7427.46s)]
*  Even the Cypriots will ignore it. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7428.7s)]
*  Not interested. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7430.46s)]
*  But it mentioned three people who were still alive [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7432.179999999999s)]
*  who had been informants for the CIA. [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7437.259999999999s)]
*  And the law says that if they are outed, [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7440.0599999999995s)]
*  we have to offer them resettlement. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7443.74s)]
*  So rather than go through that whole rigmarole, [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7446.219999999999s)]
*  we made an appointment with Condi to ask her to just- [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7449.219999999999s)]
*  National Security Advisor. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7452.0199999999995s)]
*  National Security Advisor, thank you, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7452.86s)]
*  to just remove those three cables. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7454.38s)]
*  Nobody's going to miss them [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7456.42s)]
*  because nobody's ever going to read this book. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7457.38s)]
*  But just in case. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7459.54s)]
*  So I walked over to Kofor's office [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7461.860000000001s)]
*  to tell him that our car was ready. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7463.5s)]
*  And his secretary- [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7465.46s)]
*  So you were at Langley that morning early. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7466.3s)]
*  I was, I was there early. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7468.46s)]
*  And his secretary had a small TV on her desk. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7470.14s)]
*  You couldn't watch TV on your computer in those days. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7474.18s)]
*  And I said, what happened to the World Trade Center? [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7477.14s)]
*  And she said, a plane flew into it. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7479.7s)]
*  And because I'm an idiot sometimes, [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7482.62s)]
*  I said, you know what? [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7484.14s)]
*  That happened once before. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7485.5s)]
*  In the 1930s, a plane flew into the Empire State Building, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7486.9800000000005s)]
*  but it was really foggy and raining that day. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7491.14s)]
*  It's so crystal clear today. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7494.34s)]
*  How can you not see that you're flying [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7495.62s)]
*  into the World Trade Center? [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7497.34s)]
*  And then the second plane hit. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7498.820000000001s)]
*  And she turned to me and she said, [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7500.860000000001s)]
*  did you see that or did I imagine it? [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7503.14s)]
*  And I ran back to my office. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7506.62s)]
*  I said, guys, we're under attack. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7508.02s)]
*  Two planes just hit both towers of the World Trade Center. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7510.42s)]
*  We all ran up to the front where Kofor's office was. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7513.62s)]
*  And you have to imagine this big bullpen [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7517.14s)]
*  where there are maybe 150 or 200 people [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7520.0599999999995s)]
*  in partitioned cubbies. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7522.78s)]
*  And then there are private offices all around the perimeter. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7526.74s)]
*  And then there are TVs hanging from the ceiling [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7529.42s)]
*  above Kofor's office on BBC, CNN, Fox, Canal Plus, RT, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7531.62s)]
*  from all over the world. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7539.18s)]
*  And they're all showing the same thing. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7540.42s)]
*  And there's silence. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7542.9s)]
*  And then somebody behind me shouts, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7544.74s)]
*  will somebody please lead? [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7546.86s)]
*  And Kofor said, oh, yes, you. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7549.46s)]
*  Go to the director's office and tell him this. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7552.219999999999s)]
*  You, go to security. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7554.219999999999s)]
*  You, go to operations. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7555.5s)]
*  And the rest of us like, what do you want us to do? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7557.62s)]
*  Evacuate. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7561.66s)]
*  Nobody's evacuating. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7563.139999999999s)]
*  Literally not a single person evacuated. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7564.58s)]
*  Finally, the CIA cops came in and said, [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7566.7s)]
*  if you don't evacuate, you'll be arrested. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7568.98s)]
*  So we evacuated. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7572.26s)]
*  I got about halfway home, had to abandon my car. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7573.86s)]
*  So I started walking. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7577.3s)]
*  Why? [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7578.58s)]
*  It was gridlock like World War Z, [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7579.86s)]
*  like the end of the world. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7583.22s)]
*  I mean, on the George Washington Parkway, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7584.82s)]
*  which is four lanes, it's like 12 cars wide. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7587.74s)]
*  And everybody's just parked. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7593.18s)]
*  That parkway passes right by the Pentagon. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7594.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's right, right by the Pentagon. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7597.54s)]
*  When I got to the Teddy Roosevelt Bridge, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7600.66s)]
*  I lived just up from the Teddy Roosevelt Bridge. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7603.42s)]
*  I saw the deputy national security advisor [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7606.38s)]
*  with no shoes evacuating. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7609.26s)]
*  And I said to this guy next to me, how could this happen? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7613.0599999999995s)]
*  That's the deputy national security advisor. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7618.0599999999995s)]
*  He ran out of the White House without shoes to save himself. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7621.34s)]
*  I ended up, my ex-wife and I, [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7627.06s)]
*  we climbed to the roof of my building. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7631.02s)]
*  We were engaged at the time [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7633.46s)]
*  and we watched the Pentagon burn for a little while. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7634.9800000000005s)]
*  And finally I said, this is ridiculous. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7636.9400000000005s)]
*  We have to get back to work. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7639.02s)]
*  And so I walked back to my car, drove across the median, [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7640.9800000000005s)]
*  went back to CIA and stayed there for the next four days. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7644.9400000000005s)]
*  I just slept under the desk, hour, two hours at a time. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7647.9400000000005s)]
*  And your fiance also worked at CIA? [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7650.78s)]
*  She did the same thing. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7652.62s)]
*  She did the same thing. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7654.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, and then the world changed in your life, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7657.139999999999s)]
*  in particular changed. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7659.5s)]
*  I could never, ever have predicted the changes [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7661.0199999999995s)]
*  either for me personally or for the CIA in the country. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7664.54s)]
*  So you didn't think as one of the only Arabic speakers [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7668.299999999999s)]
*  at the Counterterrorism Center at CIA in Langley. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7671.9s)]
*  Of course you knew you would play a significant role [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7675.0599999999995s)]
*  in what came next. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7677.299999999999s)]
*  I expected that I would. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7678.139999999999s)]
*  And you did, but you never expected you'd go to prison. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7678.98s)]
*  Never, not in a thousand years what I've said. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7682.46s)]
*  I'll do the prison experience for a little while, [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7687.22s)]
*  see how that works out. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7689.06s)]
*  So I just wanna ask you one last question. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7690.860000000001s)]
*  Of all the things you've said, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7692.54s)]
*  which I've known you for a while, [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7693.860000000001s)]
*  but I'm, and we just had dinner last night, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7696.18s)]
*  but I'm shocked by some of the things [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7697.42s)]
*  that you have said actually. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7699.58s)]
*  And I grew up around this stuff and I'm still shocked. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7701.62s)]
*  So the story that you told about the fake Japanese diplomat [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7703.74s)]
*  trying to set you up is remarkable. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7709.0199999999995s)]
*  That's a remarkable story. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7714.26s)]
*  Sick. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7715.54s)]
*  What is sick? [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7716.5s)]
*  It's unbelievable if they would do that [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7717.46s)]
*  to an American citizen, particularly one [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7718.9s)]
*  with a demonstrated record of serving the country [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7721.0599999999995s)]
*  at personal risk. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7723.139999999999s)]
*  So, but outrage aside, it does sort of reframe [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7725.42s)]
*  your understanding of how things actually work [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7728.0599999999995s)]
*  that happened to you. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7730.58s)]
*  That's a real thing. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7731.42s)]
*  Yes. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7732.34s)]
*  Provable. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7733.179999999999s)]
*  And you said that it had in fact changed your view [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7734.139999999999s)]
*  of how things actually worked. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7736.34s)]
*  And you'd reassessed your understanding [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7737.54s)]
*  of things that had happened in American history [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7741.5s)]
*  and then maybe they're not exactly what they seem to be. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7743.42s)]
*  That's right. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7745.7s)]
*  Can you go into a little more depth [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7746.54s)]
*  about what you're thinking now? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7747.94s)]
*  The short version is I have come to believe very strongly [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7749.78s)]
*  that Ronald Reagan was right when he said [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7755.18s)]
*  that government is the problem. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7757.86s)]
*  It's not the solution to the problem. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7760.14s)]
*  He was right. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7762.46s)]
*  He recognized it and the rest of us failed to see it. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7763.86s)]
*  So now when I hear about standoffs, let's say, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7768.66s)]
*  between American citizens and the Bureau of Land Management, [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7773.179999999999s)]
*  for example, or ATF or DEA, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7777.66s)]
*  I no longer believe what is reported in the media. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7783.98s)]
*  I no longer believe the strategic leaks [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7789.179999999999s)]
*  that come from whatever Bureau or agency to spin the story. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7792.54s)]
*  I've gotten to the point where I'm obsessed [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7799.5s)]
*  with doing my own investigations. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7802.54s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7804.9s)]
*  And I read all source material [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7805.74s)]
*  because the truth has to be out there somewhere. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7808.3s)]
*  I just feel like I have to put it together for myself. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7811.26s)]
*  So now when we talk about the Kennedy assassinations [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7814.9s)]
*  or MLK or as we said earlier, Ruby Ridge or Waco, [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7818.82s)]
*  whatever it is, I default to doubting [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7827.74s)]
*  the government account. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7833.62s)]
*  So you worked for the government during Waco. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7835.5s)]
*  That was my first day working at a newspaper. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7838.62s)]
*  So I remember the chaos in the newsroom when that happened. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7843.0199999999995s)]
*  So that was 93. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7845.58s)]
*  93. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7846.82s)]
*  That must have been the spring of 93. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7847.9s)]
*  Is that right? [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7850.46s)]
*  Yes. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7851.299999999999s)]
*  So boy, over 30 years ago, [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7852.139999999999s)]
*  but you worked for the government then. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7854.179999999999s)]
*  I was at the CIA at the time and it was on every TV in the CIA. [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7855.339999999999s)]
*  And I remember looking at it, not really having an opinion. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7858.98s)]
*  And my boss saying, well, it's about time [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7863.42s)]
*  they finally moved on that operation. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7865.78s)]
*  So what was that? [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7868.54s)]
*  Boy, that's really a forgotten moment in American history. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7870.179999999999s)]
*  So there was a religious sect known as the Branch Davidians. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7872.98s)]
*  So that's what we called them. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7876.7s)]
*  A guy called David Koresh, that was his cult name anyway. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7878.58s)]
*  And they were accused of mistreating children, [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7882.5s)]
*  which maybe they were, I have no idea. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7886.3s)]
*  Hoarding weapons. [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7888.0199999999995s)]
*  Of course, and hoarding weapons. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7889.42s)]
*  And they were surrounded by federal agents [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7890.82s)]
*  at their compound in Waco, Texas. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7893.26s)]
*  And that standoff culminated in a shootout [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7895.86s)]
*  which federal agents were killed. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7899.099999999999s)]
*  And most of the occupants of that compound [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7901.0199999999995s)]
*  were burned to death. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7903.9s)]
*  I think it was something like 27 of them. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7905.42s)]
*  And half of them were children, like young children. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7908.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was maybe more than 27. [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7911.82s)]
*  More than 27. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7913.54s)]
*  Yeah, it was a lot. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7914.38s)]
*  It was awful. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7915.82s)]
*  But what was it? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7917.1s)]
*  Was that more than what we were told it was, do you think? [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7918.18s)]
*  Well, the spin was, this was a dangerous lunatic [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7922.9400000000005s)]
*  and he had to be stopped before he used those guns [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7926.78s)]
*  to go out and kill people. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7929.1s)]
*  The truth of the matter is, [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7930.82s)]
*  you're allowed to buy as many guns as you want. [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7932.9400000000005s)]
*  I've proven that, yep. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7934.86s)]
*  I have. Good. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7937.099999999999s)]
*  You're not allowed to buy guns [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7938.0599999999995s)]
*  because you're a convicted felon. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7939.099999999999s)]
*  I'm a convicted felon. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7940.38s)]
*  And you've done nothing wrong. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7941.299999999999s)]
*  And I really hope you receive [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7942.259999999999s)]
*  that presidential pardon soon. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7943.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7944.86s)]
*  And on top of losing my gun, I lost my pension. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7945.7s)]
*  The Obama Justice Department seized my federal pension. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7951.0599999999995s)]
*  Why? 20 years of proud service. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7955.0199999999995s)]
*  $770,000. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7958.139999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna have to work until the day I die. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7960.58s)]
*  Only a pardon can help me. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7963.62s)]
*  How could you have worked at CIA [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7965.66s)]
*  for all those years and not wind up rich? [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7967.58s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7969.98s)]
*  I have to say, that is the story that no one ever tells. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7971.22s)]
*  And I just know it from my personal, [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7974.54s)]
*  I'm just living in DC my whole life. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7977.7s)]
*  They're all rich. [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7980.42s)]
*  Have you noticed this? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7981.26s)]
*  They are all rich. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7982.099999999999s)]
*  Why are there all these former CIA officers who are rich? [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7983.78s)]
*  Some of them, excuse me, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7987.5s)]
*  some of them get enormous book advances. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7989.22s)]
*  Others make this odd transition into venture capital [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7994.1s)]
*  or consulting or butts in the seats kind of, [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=7997.66s)]
*  Booz Allen style firms. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8002.1s)]
*  A lot of them go overseas and stay overseas. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8005.9400000000005s)]
*  So the CIA pays for everything. [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8009.7s)]
*  The only thing you pay for is your phone bill. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8011.740000000001s)]
*  And they just invest, invest, invest for 30 years [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8014.5s)]
*  and come out with plenty of money. [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8017.3s)]
*  I've lived in nice neighborhoods for a long time [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8020.62s)]
*  and they're always CIA people on my street. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8024.3s)]
*  Always. Always. [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8026.14s)]
*  Half of McLean, Virginia is CIA. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8027.46s)]
*  Yeah, and the District of Columbia and Florida. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8029.7s)]
*  And it's just like legit rich. [[02:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8031.58s)]
*  Yeah, rich. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8034.26s)]
*  That's not a good sign, is it? [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8036.820000000001s)]
*  No, it's not a good sign. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8038.9800000000005s)]
*  Cause you're not supposed to capitalize on a position. [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8041.02s)]
*  Not when you have the power of life and death over people. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8043.7s)]
*  That's what bothers me. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8046.14s)]
*  It's not just like people from the labor department [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8047.22s)]
*  or commerce who are like leveraging their skills to riches. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8049.42s)]
*  It's like people who have information [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8052.9400000000005s)]
*  that they're the only ones legally allowed to possess. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8056.02s)]
*  The true inside information and the power to kill people. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8059.26s)]
*  That's right. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8062.780000000001s)]
*  Like that's one category. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8064.22s)]
*  With no questions asked. [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8065.740000000001s)]
*  May I add one thing? [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8068.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8069.660000000001s)]
*  I recently received an email from someone [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8070.5s)]
*  I had never heard of, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8076.02s)]
*  but this is the third such email that I have received [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8077.38s)]
*  and I wanted to mention it. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8081.9s)]
*  So of all things, I received it through eBay. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8085.38s)]
*  I was selling something on eBay and somebody saw that, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8093.46s)]
*  cause I'm an open book. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8096.5s)]
*  So I'm just like John Kiriakou on eBay. [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8098.42s)]
*  So I received this thing through eBay and it says, [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8101.1s)]
*  Dear John, it's so nice to finally speak to you. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8104.26s)]
*  I've been watching your YouTube videos [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8107.46s)]
*  and I love all the content [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8109.34s)]
*  and I've been wanting to reach out to you for many years. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8110.54s)]
*  I'm one of the FBI agents [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8113.1s)]
*  who wants to personally apologize to you [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8114.62s)]
*  for the disgraceful way that the FBI [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8116.9800000000005s)]
*  and our federal government treated you. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8118.900000000001s)]
*  I worked on your case with both headquarters [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8120.780000000001s)]
*  and the Washington field office team. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8123.58s)]
*  And I know many of the personnel [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8125.26s)]
*  that you're familiar with, unfortunately. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8126.66s)]
*  That case was directed and driven by senior most officials. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8129.1s)]
*  Many mid-level and street personnel were against it, [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8132.98s)]
*  but nevertheless, we just followed orders. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8135.7s)]
*  Anyway, I've always felt bad about what we did to you [[02:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8137.98s)]
*  and for the way you and your family were treated. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8141.0599999999995s)]
*  And I want to personally apologize. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8142.9s)]
*  Well, God bless that man. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8144.66s)]
*  Do you think that's real? [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8146.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8147.82s)]
*  Yep. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8150.219999999999s)]
*  Two other FBI agents sent similar emails to my attorneys. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8151.0599999999995s)]
*  They're sorry they did as they were told. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8154.98s)]
*  It's nice, but- [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8159.419999999999s)]
*  Do you worry about anything further happening to you? [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8160.26s)]
*  I did for a long time, yes. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8163.22s)]
*  There were people inside the justice department [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8166.42s)]
*  with whom I was friendly who said, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8169.66s)]
*  oh, the CIA is really mad that you only did 23 months. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8171.5s)]
*  Like they really wanted you to die in there. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8176.06s)]
*  So be on your best behavior [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8178.62s)]
*  because they're watching everything you do. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8180.3s)]
*  And then that wore off about two years out of prison. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8182.26s)]
*  I didn't see the surveillance anymore. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8187.06s)]
*  Never got any funny emails. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8190.06s)]
*  As soon as I got home, [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8192.78s)]
*  I was home for a couple of days from prison. [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8193.66s)]
*  And I got an email from a guy who claimed to be an attorney [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8195.54s)]
*  saying he had some classified information [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8198.62s)]
*  that showed a crime and he wanted to send it to me. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8201.140000000001s)]
*  And I said, don't you dare. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8203.18s)]
*  I don't want any classified information. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8204.380000000001s)]
*  Call the FBI and give it to them. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8206.300000000001s)]
*  But I figured it's just some nut trying to set me up. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8209.140000000001s)]
*  So anytime I had a question, [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8212.34s)]
*  I would just call the lawyers, refer people to the lawyers. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8214.34s)]
*  And then it ended up just going away after a while. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8217.62s)]
*  So the story that you just told [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8219.900000000001s)]
*  over the last couple of hours is very distressing to hear [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8221.54s)]
*  as someone who grew up in this country, [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8226.820000000002s)]
*  believes in the country, loves the country. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8229.1s)]
*  I can't even imagine what it must be like to be you. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8232.18s)]
*  And yet you tell it complete without bitterness [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8235.1s)]
*  and no self-pity whatsoever. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8237.34s)]
*  How have you been able to maintain emotional equilibrium, [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8239.5s)]
*  wisdom, perspective, and peace [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8243.380000000001s)]
*  in the middle of everything you've been through? [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8245.46s)]
*  Thank you for asking that. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8247.939999999999s)]
*  When I was in prison, I read constantly, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8249.46s)]
*  including biographies of Martin Luther King [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8253.619999999999s)]
*  and Nelson Mandela. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8257.019999999999s)]
*  And I thought, wow, what these guys went through [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8259.619999999999s)]
*  and they just forgave over and over. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8262.259999999998s)]
*  Nelson Mandela especially, the way he was treated [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8264.699999999999s)]
*  and kept in solitary confinement on Robben Island [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8268.539999999999s)]
*  and he forgave. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8272.019999999999s)]
*  And then there was a biography [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8273.62s)]
*  of a 20th century Greek Orthodox saint called Saint Nektarios, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8274.94s)]
*  Nektarios of Aegina. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8279.22s)]
*  And he had been the Greek Orthodox Bishop [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8281.14s)]
*  of Alexandria, Egypt, and other priests [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8283.78s)]
*  who were jealous of his rapid rise accused him [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8286.34s)]
*  of having an affair with a nun. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8289.3s)]
*  And so he was stripped of his office. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8290.98s)]
*  He never attained high office again, [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8293.74s)]
*  but he forgave everybody for what they had done to him. [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8297.22s)]
*  And he hadn't done it. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8300.3s)]
*  No, he hadn't done anything. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8301.42s)]
*  And I thought, you know what? [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8303.74s)]
*  These people went through so much more than I did. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8305.02s)]
*  It was so much worse for them. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8307.58s)]
*  And I've become friendly with one of the former prisoners [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8310.82s)]
*  at Guantanamo, Mohamedou Uld-Slahi. [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8316.58s)]
*  The CIA kidnapped Mohamedou from Mauritania [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8320.66s)]
*  while he was attending his cousin's wedding. [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8323.58s)]
*  We tortured him mercilessly for 14 years. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8325.62s)]
*  14 years? [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8330.5s)]
*  And then we decided, eh, wrong guy, let him go. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8332.06s)]
*  Actually? [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8334.9s)]
*  Yeah, which happens with more frequency [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8337.26s)]
*  than you might think. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8338.98s)]
*  And so when he got out, he went onto Twitter [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8340.66s)]
*  and I tweeted at him and I said, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8345.7s)]
*  Mohamedou, you don't know me, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8347.74s)]
*  but my government will never apologize [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8350.54s)]
*  for what it did to you. [[02:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8352.98s)]
*  So I want to apologize. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8354.1s)]
*  I am so sorry for what happened over the last 14 years. [[02:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8356.06s)]
*  And his attorney called me and said, [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8361.419999999998s)]
*  would you be interested in a conversation? [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8363.22s)]
*  I said, absolutely. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8364.779999999999s)]
*  We've been friends ever since. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8366.099999999999s)]
*  He actually lectures to my grad school class [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8367.38s)]
*  at the University of Salamanca. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8370.3s)]
*  He comes on Zoom. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8372.3s)]
*  The poor guy couldn't go back to Mauritania. [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8373.619999999999s)]
*  He was afraid they'd kill him. [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8377.419999999998s)]
*  No country wanted him because he had been in Guantanamo [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8379.06s)]
*  for 14 years. [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8381.74s)]
*  Finally, the Dutch said, we'll give you citizenship. [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8382.9s)]
*  And so he has gotten married, he has children, [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8386.74s)]
*  he got an education, living happily ever after [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8389.98s)]
*  in the Netherlands and zero bitterness. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8393.539999999999s)]
*  And I said to him one day, he said to me [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8397.699999999999s)]
*  in front of my class, what you just said, [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8400.78s)]
*  you're not bitter at all for what I said. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8402.58s)]
*  Me, I said, you, you're like Mandela. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8404.46s)]
*  How can you not be bitter after what we did to you 14 years? [[02:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8408.38s)]
*  I was 23 months. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8413.699999999999s)]
*  And he said, what would bitterness accomplish? [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8416.820000000002s)]
*  Nothing. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8420.26s)]
*  He said, bitterness would put me right back into that cage [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8421.1s)]
*  and I don't wanna live in there. [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8424.980000000001s)]
*  So that's the position that I've come to take. [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8427.66s)]
*  There's a very, that's a rational explanation of it. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8429.820000000002s)]
*  And I think it makes total sense, I think it's true. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8433.78s)]
*  But forgiving people is kind of the next step, [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8436.5s)]
*  which we've also done. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8440.300000000001s)]
*  And I like, what's the purpose of that? [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8441.66s)]
*  I've forgiven for myself. [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8444.86s)]
*  I'm sure that John Brennan doesn't give two shits [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8448.140000000001s)]
*  if John Kiriakou forgives him, [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8451.460000000001s)]
*  but I feel better having that monkey off my back. [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8454.140000000001s)]
*  So I did it for myself. [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8458.78s)]
*  I don't care what John Brennan's feelings are. [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8460.460000000001s)]
*  And John Brennan, as you described as a grudge holder, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8464.140000000001s)]
*  is the opposite. [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8466.58s)]
*  Oh yes, he is. [[02:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8467.42s)]
*  And a prisoner of that. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8468.26s)]
*  Yes. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8469.1s)]
*  John, I really appreciate all the time that you've taken [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8470.94s)]
*  to tell your story today. [[02:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8473.58s)]
*  I appreciate you giving me the opportunity. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8474.42s)]
*  And I hope that you are vindicated in the- [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8476.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8478.66s)]
*  To the fullest extent. [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8479.5s)]
*  Thank you very, very much. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8480.34s)]
*  And I hope that you're mentioned back. [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8481.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8482.7s)]
*  Truth telling should be rewarded not- [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8484.26s)]
*  It should be. [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8485.58s)]
*  You know, like I said, I'm very, very fortunate, blessed [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8486.42s)]
*  to have the support of people like you and Dr. Phil [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8490.26s)]
*  and Bruce Fine and Brett Tolman and Doug Deason [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8494.78s)]
*  and people who understand the import, not just to me, [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8498.54s)]
*  but the import to all Americans of protecting [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8502.7s)]
*  our civil liberties from a government out of control. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8505.86s)]
*  We have to make sure that we never go back there. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8509.62s)]
*  You have to reward the truth and punish lies. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8511.78s)]
*  And if you invert that, [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8514.94s)]
*  then it's a system you can't live under. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8516.34s)]
*  That's right. [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8518.5s)]
*  Because it's evil. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8519.34s)]
*  It is, it's evil. [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8520.18s)]
*  John, thank you. [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8521.740000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8522.580000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8523.42s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8524.300000000001s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8527.300000000001s)]
*  That's what they do. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8528.82s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8529.66s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8531.460000000001s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8533.34s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8536.86s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8539.86s)]
*  rather than more. [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8542.9s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8544.300000000001s)]
*  It's immoral. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8546.380000000001s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8547.74s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8548.58s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8549.9s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8550.74s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8551.58s)]
*  You can't do anything about it. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8552.42s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8553.34s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8554.86s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8556.26s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8557.42s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8558.460000000001s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8559.78s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8563.02s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8564.78s)]
*  we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8566.42s)]
*  Subscribe. [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8568.34s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8569.18s)]
*  and share this video. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8572.42s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8573.7s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8575.9s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwBMKwt14IU&t=8578.84s)]
