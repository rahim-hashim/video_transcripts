# Tom Homan’s Plan to Destroy the Cartel Empire, End Child Trafficking, and Secure the Border for Good
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [December 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw)
*  So you're pretty much the first person Trump chose after he got elected I think was the end of that week, right? Yeah [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=0.0s)]
*  I believe I was [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=5.42s)]
*  Can you summarize in one sentence what you plan to do with the job look we had a discussion that night and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=9.06s)]
*  He gave me three rails so three things he wants me to do number one is secure the border [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=16.26s)]
*  Yeah, shut the border down number two run the biggest deportation operation this country's ever seen and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=20.94s)]
*  Third he wants me to lead an effort to find the over 300,000 missing children [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=28.720000000000002s)]
*  That were trafficking to this country and this administration cannot locate them [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=35.4s)]
*  So [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=58.2s)]
*  Seal the border deport the illegals find the missing children 300,000. Yes, let's go in order [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=62.28s)]
*  Seal the border how what has happened? Do you have a sense? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=68.84s)]
*  Now over a month after Trump's victory of just how big the invasion was under Biden. Do we know what? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=72.88s)]
*  We know that we can document over 10 10 million accountants 10.5 that we can document [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=80.28s)]
*  Then we can document over two million gotaways right these are known gotaways. What is a known gotaway? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  These are people we we kept it capture an image on drone video [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  Is that in addition to the 10? Yeah [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=95.4s)]
*  So so at least 12 million people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=98.16000000000001s)]
*  Have been encountered at a border [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=101.84s)]
*  10.5 been encountered over to get it. We got it. We know there are got away because there's a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=104.48s)]
*  We capture on drone traffic video traffic or sensor traffic in board choice over one the country spawn [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=110.8s)]
*  So we know there's least 12.5 million people at that border [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=115.96s)]
*  so that's like [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=121.56s)]
*  That's like New York plus Chicago [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=124.12s)]
*  It's a historic number [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=127.08s)]
*  Which is one of the reasons why I wake up pissed off every day because we went for the most secure border in my lifetime [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=128.96s)]
*  I started in 1984 as board to lead and work for six presidents [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=134.92s)]
*  Where did you start by the way? I was born to lazy in Campbell, California San Diego sector [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=138.78s)]
*  Yeah, but to go from the most secure border my lifetime under President Trump based on data. All right [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  That's just my pain. That's data go for the most secure border my lifetime to historic illegal immigration in one administration [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=149.06s)]
*  That's by design. That's not mismanagement. Yes by design [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=157.18s)]
*  What do you think the goal was? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=161.26000000000002s)]
*  You know, I asked a lot of you why would anybody open the border up [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=163.82s)]
*  I think Joe Biden's the first president in American history who came in office and unsecured a border [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=166.82s)]
*  I worked for you know, six presidents Obama and Clinton took steps to secure the border [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=171.82s)]
*  They understood you can't possibly can't there's no way you can have strong national security [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=176.17999999999998s)]
*  If you don't border security, you need to know what's coming who's coming where's coming and why it's coming in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=180.2s)]
*  Joe Biden's first president came in office and unsecured a border and people ask me all the time why I think they see a future [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=185.88s)]
*  Political benefit I think they think these people be future Democratic voters number one two [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=191.7s)]
*  But we don't even have to get there right Tucker [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=197.0s)]
*  I mean when when Biden signed over 90s extra borders getting rid of everything we did [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=199.14s)]
*  He also returned to Trump census rule where man's a little going to be counted in all these sanctuary cities [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=204.26s)]
*  Which is going to result in more seats in house for the damage when we reproportionate seats in the house [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  Can that be undone? Oh [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=215.33999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I think President Trump needs when he gets back in when he needs to establish the other [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=217.74s)]
*  Census rule illegal and it should not be counted the census. Well, yeah because illegal foreign [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  Citizens non-americans should not be able to determine [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=228.62s)]
*  How many members of Congress you have and where they sit exactly? I think President Trump will reinstitute [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=231.98000000000002s)]
*  The game-changing policies he had during the first administration so we can secure the border. We did it before this time [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=237.98000000000002s)]
*  We're gonna finish the job [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=244.3s)]
*  How many came through Canada, do you know I don't have off the top of my head [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=245.98s)]
*  But I know the number depending on what sector you look at is six hundred to eight hundred percent increase on the northern border [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=250.06s)]
*  For specifically in upstate New York where I grew up and I still have a home up there. So I'm very [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=256.7s)]
*  Familiar with that area and I talked to board show chiefs up there all the time [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=263.21999999999997s)]
*  Northern New York it has a huge problem and the problem with with northern border a lot of si has come through northern border [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=267.38s)]
*  They can afford to fly to Canada and cross the northern border [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=275.48s)]
*  Which is wide open because there's a lot of border in very few agents [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=278.68s)]
*  So a lot of Indians a lot of Pakistani a lot of Turkey Turkish come to the northern border [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=282.44s)]
*  Well, I mean who organized this you say it was by design [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=288.88s)]
*  There are a lot of NGOs involved the United Nations is involved a bunch of religious charities pretty evil [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  Religious charities in my opinion involved in this but they seem to be coordinating with one another [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  What do we understand exactly what happened? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=307.23999999999995s)]
*  You know, we're still looking into I think under the Trump administration needs me investigation and what happened who was involved [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=310.32s)]
*  I know I have numerous conversation with Mark Green who is the chairman of Homeland Oversight [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  He plans on having some oversight hearings on this Pacific when he relates to the NGOs [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  You know, I think they were complicit a lot of this illegal immigration [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=325.96s)]
*  And certainly United Nations were south of our border working on this global [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=330.88s)]
*  Illegal immigration to United States [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  So I'm counting on the new Congress which we now have control of both the house and the Senate [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=338.2s)]
*  To conduct oversight hearings and hold people accountable. There's no way again. There's no way this is [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=343.52s)]
*  Mismanagement or incompetence. This is by design and do I think Joe Biden had the expertise to do it? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=349.12s)]
*  No, I think someone's pulling his strings [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=355.06s)]
*  So this is something to be fully investigating people need to be held accountable because well, they need to go to wreck the country [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=357.28s)]
*  They need to go to prison. They created the biggest national security vulnerability this nation's ever seen [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=363.44s)]
*  We got a record number of people on terrorist wassup being arrested. We got 2.2 million people and this is my biggest issue [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=368.2s)]
*  I brought up for the last two years. It's just not about illegal migration anymore [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=374.11999999999995s)]
*  You cause a crisis this big that overwhelms a board patrol where many times 70% of agents were pulled off the line [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  Doing this humanitarian crisis right change the diapers making baby formula make a hospital runs doing that humanitarian [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=384.36s)]
*  mission [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=391.48s)]
*  Left leaving 30% of our Homeland Security officials left secure in the border [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=392.64s)]
*  There was times in the last two years were a hundred percent [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=397.48s)]
*  100% of border police were pulled off the line such as help in El Paso [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=400.92s)]
*  Because when they when they got overcrowded this administration said wait, we can't have overcrowding. That's a bad optic [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=405.08000000000004s)]
*  So let's pull every agent off the line process as quick as possible release as quickly as possible because there's no overcrowding [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=410.68s)]
*  There's nothing to see here. The board is so secure [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=417.76s)]
*  So when you when when you over one board to let's run the bad things happen [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=420.28s)]
*  That's when we got 2.2 million gotaways, right? That's when the fentanyl comes across to kill a quarter million Americans [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=424.64s)]
*  That's that's why sex trafficking of women and children is up 600% [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=429.65999999999997s)]
*  That's why the number of migrant deaths is that a historic hot so [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=433.88s)]
*  This what they people call this innocent illegal immigration crisis [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=439.92s)]
*  Made a lot of bad things happen because the board so strictly overwhelmed and couldn't do the national [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=445.08000000000004s)]
*  So it changed the culture of the United States [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=449.42s)]
*  Which is worse than any of the things that you and more permanent than any of the things you listed [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=451.40000000000003s)]
*  You can't run in and change people's ancient culture been here for 250 years. You can't do that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=455.32000000000005s)]
*  No, it's the worst crime ever committed against the US worse than the Civil War in my opinion [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=461.12s)]
*  So but the question is like who did this and why so the United Nations we pay the largest share of the UN budget [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=466.0s)]
*  You know, we should have some ability to control what the UN does but they commit this act of war against us [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=474.48s)]
*  Do we know who did at the UN and why I do not but it's something that's gonna be I [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=480.78s)]
*  Believe it should be investigated. I'm pushing people. I'm coming to the administration where that we need to investigate it again [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=486.36s)]
*  I've talked to numerous representatives on the hill that swear they're going to have [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=491.8s)]
*  Hearings on this and we need to be American people need to know exactly what happened who is responsible [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=496.92s)]
*  Do you think that [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  the fentanyl [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  traffickers [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=509.88s)]
*  Known as the cartels, I guess I'm not exactly sure what that means [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=511.68s)]
*  To ask you actually but you keep reading and hearing that they have control of parts of the southwestern United States [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=515.48s)]
*  First of all, what is a cartel? Who are they where they from? And do you think that's true? Well, the criminal cartels in Mexico [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=523.36s)]
*  They were born out of the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=529.0s)]
*  Narcotics smuggling in industry in Mexico and they're powerful. Look, they're like a fortune 500 company. Yes, this is not a gang anymore [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=531.0799999999999s)]
*  Right. Yeah, at least go cartels is there in over 45 countries of the world [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  Right and not only responsible for moving narcotics in this country [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=542.92s)]
*  They're also they're currently in every major city the United States because not only they smuggling the drugs in the United States [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=547.0s)]
*  They're taking over the distribution within the United States. Yeah, right. So again [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=553.38s)]
*  And I said this at the RNC and I and President Trump agrees with me these criminal cartels [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=558.56s)]
*  I've killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in the world combined right and every war they were more than Second World War [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=564.3s)]
*  So that's why they need to be designated terrorist organizations and wiped off the face of the earth and it's going to take the United States [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=570.88s)]
*  To do it Mexico has failed to do it. Even if they tried to do it [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=576.48s)]
*  Bottom line is much of the Mexican military much much of the Mexican law enforcement much of the Mexican government's corrupt [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=580.36s)]
*  That's just a fact. Well, then why okay, so I noticed that the incoming administration [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=586.56s)]
*  Just basically toppled the Prime Minister of Canada was a thoroughly evil person called Justin Trudeau and [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=591.04s)]
*  By just by threatening tariffs they kind of fixed the Canada problem Trump fixed it in about I don't know 20 minutes [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=597.16s)]
*  But how much more leverage do we have over Mexico? I mean, we're the entire economy of Mexico. Why don't we do that with Mexico? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=603.56s)]
*  Well, we are present numbers threatened terrorists and she's the president seems [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=610.12s)]
*  seems to [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=614.92s)]
*  Say she's going to help we'll see if her actions match your words [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=616.48s)]
*  But president Trump has a lot of power over Mexico look the terrorists alone [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=620.4399999999999s)]
*  Mexico needs us more than we needed them, right? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=624.64s)]
*  And look, I'm not saying every cop every soldier every politician Mexico's corrupt but many are that's just a fact when I was ice director [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=626.64s)]

*  We vetted them so we can work with them [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=636.52s)]
*  But we didn't even tell the vetted units everything we know because we just couldn't be sure right? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=638.4399999999999s)]
*  But president has a lot of leverage remember when I became when I became board of chelates in 1984 [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=643.48s)]
*  My one of my first assignments are the Academy was protecting a port of entry in Tocate, California [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=647.82s)]
*  Because we had a DEA agent that was tortured and murdered Kiki Camerana [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=653.1400000000001s)]
*  I think I remember very well and they wouldn't help us to identify and turn over the people responsible [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=657.2600000000001s)]
*  Ronald Reagan shut down a port of entries and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=663.34s)]
*  What I take them two days all of a sudden we know who committed crime and so President Trump can obviously do that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=666.0200000000001s)]
*  He can add and all the visas know and the tourist visas the business visas [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=672.22s)]
*  There's a lot of power has or Mexico and he needs [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=677.4599999999999s)]
*  President Trump's willing to do whatever it takes to protect our sovereignty to protect this country and he's ready to do it [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=680.4599999999999s)]
*  He proved the first time you know when remain in Mexico program Mexico didn't want to do that third state country agreements [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=685.8199999999999s)]
*  Mexico didn't want to do that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=691.18s)]
*  They didn't want to put 10,000 military on their on their border or president Trump threatened them with tariffs and they came to the table [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=692.3s)]
*  There are so many nice Mexican people. I mean most Mexican people I've met [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=699.54s)]
*  I really like that we forget that the government's very anti-american is not our ally in any sense [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=703.9s)]
*  We spend all this energy being mad at Assad whoever who cares and we live next to this country [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=709.0600000000001s)]
*  That's helping to kill hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. No one ever says anything about it [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=715.02s)]
*  Don't don't you think it would be worth shifting some of that emotional energy and military resources to like [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=719.26s)]
*  Countries right next to us who are hurting us [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=725.74s)]
*  I'm 100% with you and that's why I've been pushing for that to Mexico to come to the table and be accountable [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=727.86s)]
*  It's against the law in Mexico to trafficking women and children [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=733.86s)]
*  But they don't do anything about it. It's against the law in Mexico to transit to that country if you're from another country [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=737.42s)]
*  Well a transit visa, but they allow it [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=743.46s)]
*  I mean look at the beach the big train that thousands of people can we have a weekend? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=745.62s)]
*  They didn't do anything until president Trump got in office and had put a stop to it [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=749.54s)]
*  I mean, but good thing is a lot of countries are willing to come to the table right now [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=754.02s)]
*  Mexico says they're going to let's see what they do. I'll be deeply involved those conversations [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=758.14s)]
*  Panama Panama wants to come to the table help the United States secure our border by shutting down a daring gap [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=762.44s)]
*  This administration said they're going to do it [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=768.28s)]
*  Secretary Mallorca said he was going to do it Panama never got any funding to do it [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=770.6s)]
*  They never got anything done with with this administration. They were coming to the table again [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=774.12s)]
*  We will shut down a daring gap, but please help us [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=777.92s)]
*  We will help them daring gap would shut in the daring gap down and be a huge game-changer on illegal migration to this country [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=780.32s)]
*  But again given the economic leverage the United States has [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=788.52s)]
*  That shouldn't take more than a weekend right there's gonna be pretty quick [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=793.68s)]
*  I mean we're gonna we're gonna come to the table what we need Mexico to do remain a Mexico program a game-changer [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=797.78s)]
*  That needs to happen quickly. That was a game changer because after about [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=803.16s)]
*  Two months they stopped coming they stopped coming because they knew they weren't being released into the United States [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=807.7199999999999s)]
*  To not show up in court and even if they show up in court [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=814.32s)]
*  No one's looking to remove them because on this administration ice can't arrest somebody for simply being illegally the United States [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=817.96s)]
*  Secretary Mallorca has made that clear [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=823.6800000000001s)]
*  They got to have a criminal conviction before ice came and look at them even though they're illegally here [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=825.32s)]
*  So the remaining Mexico's game to they stopped coming they stopped selling [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=830.08s)]
*  Everything they had given the cartels every dollar they had to come to United States to be released [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=834.36s)]
*  When the remaining Mexico program came in the power came in the place [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=839.48s)]
*  They stopped coming when they stopped coming look the lives that were saved look at the money [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=843.2s)]
*  That was saved if someone's really escaping fear and persecution from their homeland from their government home government [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=847.9200000000001s)]
*  It's a really scary and persecution [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=853.96s)]
*  They're gonna be willing to wait Mexico for the hearing but most of them know but why would the US take anybody who's I mean? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=856.0400000000001s)]
*  Why is it our job? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=862.2s)]
*  Given our appalling track record around the world of like trying to make things better you make them worse because the world's super complicated [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=864.24s)]
*  Why do we have an obligation to take anybody from anywhere ever? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=872.72s)]
*  I don't really get where does that come from? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=876.08s)]
*  Well, that was a genius of the remain a Mexico program, right? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=877.72s)]
*  Cuz the president Trump I remember sitting the office over also one day we're talking about this and I was trying to explain to him [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=880.6s)]
*  And he understood clearly what the whole situation [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=885.96s)]
*  Situation all asylum is I told him that if you look at the data [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=889.68s)]
*  immigration court data [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=893.4799999999999s)]
*  About nine out of ten people who claim asylum at our border [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=895.52s)]
*  Never get relief from US government because they simply don't qualify [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=899.3599999999999s)]
*  They don't show up in court then you look at the Homeland Security Life Sackle report a report put that's pull up the homeland security [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=902.76s)]
*  For instance family units for those that were ordered removed only six percent leave [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  So I explained the president Trump nine out of ten don't even have a valid claim but when that nine I think it's order removed [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=915.5s)]
*  Six percent leave he says [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=922.38s)]
*  You know, he's been taking long to why the hell we doing this [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=924.7s)]
*  Yeah, so let's not let him and let's have a remain a Mexico program if you really escape and firm persecution [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=927.1800000000001s)]
*  You wait in Mexico if you win your case, which are very few welcome to United States [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=931.54s)]
*  But if you don't win your case [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=936.54s)]
*  We don't have to go find you and we're not putting this message out of catch and release [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=937.5s)]
*  So people keep coming knowing they're gonna release in the United States at the same time knowing when they lose their case [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=941.1s)]
*  No one's looking to remove them that whole dynamics won't change. Yes, right because [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=945.88s)]
*  I've said I've been real clear since the day president Trump appointed me if you're in the country legally [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=950.98s)]
*  You got a problem, right? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=956.5s)]
*  If we don't take the judges order immigration court when you ordered you removed he gets a deportation officer [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=958.02s)]
*  deportation order [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=964.14s)]
*  If we don't execute those orders and what the hell are we doing? [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=965.46s)]
*  Shut down the immigration court doesn't make don't mean anything anymore take the board draw the border because there's no consequences for entering this country legally [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=968.9s)]
*  We'll give you due process [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=976.02s)]
*  But when your order removed you're going to be removed or if we don't we send the message to the whole world [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=977.62s)]
*  You can enter the country legally which is a crime [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=982.6999999999999s)]
*  You can see a judge or not see a judge get an order removal [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=984.9399999999999s)]
*  No one's looking for you and that's what the Democrats are doing on this administration. They have overwhelmed the system [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=987.9399999999999s)]

*  Immigration the court doc is pushed back seven maybe as much as nine years like in New York [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=996.18s)]
*  By that time when they get an order removal, they got two or three USC kids, right? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1000.8199999999999s)]

*  We had due process a great taxpayer expense [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1026.64s)]
*  He was already moved by federal judge the option is just let me stay because if we're going to do that [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1029.16s)]

*  Did they put it? Yes, you know this whole thing cops immediately because a racist [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1144.3400000000001s)]
*  Governor Abbott done more secure this border and anybody in this administration guys great DeSantis the same [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1149.04s)]
*  Do you know who first came up with the idea of busing people sanctuary cities? It was President Trump [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1155.1200000000001s)]
*  I remember sitting in the old loss one time. He said why don't we do that? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1159.24s)]
*  So we started putting plans together [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1162.56s)]
*  But the remain of Mexico program was such a game changer [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1164.76s)]
*  We couldn't fill a bus up if we wanted to so we beat this that we beat the problem before we got actually got to that [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1167.96s)]
*  That was the problem though is that the people doing it didn't have a precise enough understanding of rich white liberal culture [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1174.1200000000001s)]
*  But I do so they would bust them to New York then they wind up in Midtown and Queens [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1180.64s)]
*  Okay [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1184.44s)]
*  None of the people who are doing this were affected by it [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1184.92s)]
*  But I could give you a list of zip codes where like Tony Blinken lives and stuff like that [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1187.24s)]
*  Because I know that world they need to be moved into the neighborhoods of the people [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1191.88s)]
*  Who are calling you racist for wanting to have laws and borders like they need to feel the effects of their own [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1197.32s)]
*  destruction [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1203.8s)]
*  So just text me and I will send you the zip codes [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1205.2s)]
*  I mean it too because what happened is they open the borders and then all these people like move to Jackson, Wyoming [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1208.24s)]
*  To the least diverse zip codes in the in the country. They literally ran to the hills to get away from diversity [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1214.1200000000001s)]
*  I think we need to add to that though the [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1220.48s)]
*  The senators and congressmen are pushing back in a board board secure 100% [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1223.72s)]
*  You know moving the illegal animals right outside of the vice president come on the Harris's residence [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1227.68s)]
*  That was a game changer too. So I think not only not only those who are well financed [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1232.84s)]
*  How about the politicians who are pushing back against any any form of enforcement of our border laws? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1238.32s)]
*  Well, that's why Bernie Sanders needs a ton of Haitians in Vermont because it it's just it's appallingly [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1243.0s)]
*  It's blindingly white it needs to change. I couldn't agree more [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1247.72s)]
*  So but just back to the cartel question, I don't I don't know that much about it, but I keep hearing I think informed people [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1252.08s)]
*  Say man, you know parts of New Mexico, Arizona, California [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1258.08s)]
*  Even Florida Texas, or you know, there's real control [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1263.0s)]
*  By these cartels in the way that they control Mexico [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1268.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're basically a state within a state with their own army and armor personnel carriers and tanks and like, you know [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1271.08s)]
*  Do you think that's real? Do you think they have that kind of beachhead here? Oh, absolutely [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1277.64s)]
*  I just said earlier they're like a fortune 500 company. They're well financed. They're diversified in their in their funding and look [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1282.76s)]
*  I've seen a lot of intelligence report. They have access to military grade weapons [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1290.2s)]
*  so take the Mexican military on the Mexican law enforcement they do all the time and [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1294.88s)]
*  It's just not my opinion that they have control operational or Southwest border and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1299.48s)]
*  I've talked to chief patrol agents who agree with me [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1305.12s)]
*  They've lost operational control Southwest border one chief patrol agent use the term broken arrow [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1308.1599999999999s)]
*  I was on a phone the one time it was time. I can't contain what's coming across [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1313.24s)]
*  I'm lucky I'm catching 10% of it the criminal cartels knowing the this administration causes [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1316.84s)]
*  huge humanitarian crisis and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1323.48s)]
*  Overwhelmed the board chose we discussed earlier and whatever assets is left on the border left to patrol the criminal cartels [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1325.96s)]
*  You think a hundred family units or 200 family unit show up accidentally at the same place a certain time [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1332.4s)]
*  No, the cartels control that right those send a group to one area knowing whatever left on the border was seized to that humanitarian crisis [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  Right to they have to go do a deal that they create gaps in the system [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1344.22s)]
*  That's when they move the fat and all this killed a quarter million Americans [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1348.24s)]
*  That's why sex trafficking is up 600% the cartels they create gaps in our system and and that's where they operate and [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1351.1200000000001s)]
*  And for the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1358.1200000000001s)]
*  Democrat Democratic representatives up on hills and what most fat and all comes to the port of entry [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1359.72s)]
*  that's that's just much garbage most fat and all's recedes that a port of entry because every vehicle stopped in and [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1364.24s)]
*  based on the CBP targeting system, which is law enforcement sensitive, but and based on the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1371.4s)]
*  Responses to the questions [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1377.96s)]
*  Chances are they get secondary and they'll find some things between the port of entry [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1380.16s)]
*  We're maybe touching 10% [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1384.68s)]
*  Yeah, so if I'm a criminal cartel, I'm gonna use a route of least resistance [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1386.68s)]
*  I know my vehicles can be stopped at port of entry will be secondary that I don't know [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1390.34s)]
*  But between a port of entry with 70% of the agents off the line, that's wrong. I'm gonna move my product [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1394.24s)]
*  I mean, it's not rocket just right over the open border. Absolutely [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1399.04s)]
*  So I I know I'm jumping around but I have so many questions for you I [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1403.44s)]
*  Read in the last three days [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1407.44s)]
*  It's hard to believe this could be true that the Biden administration [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1409.92s)]
*  Auctioned off portions of the unfinished border wall at bargain basement prices. Is that true? Yes [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1412.92s)]
*  I actually had a conversation with Senator Lindsey Graham two days ago. Someone needs to take some action because this is this is [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  products that the taxpayers already paid for and they're going to auction it off and now, you know [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1425.44s)]
*  Texas talk about buying a bag shouldn't have to buy it back. We bought once before right [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1430.76s)]
*  This administration's out there out in a couple more weeks, why would they continue to [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1436.2s)]
*  Set us up for failure. That's what they're trying to do, right? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1442.16s)]
*  President buying signing all these executive orders and one sell the border product [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1445.24s)]
*  I thought the American people on election day give this country clear mandate [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1448.4s)]
*  They want to secure border but this administration gonna stop it. They won't stop at anything to slow us down [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1451.96s)]
*  It's not gonna slow us down. We're gonna get that border wall finished, but the the mirror [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1457.76s)]
*  Stupidity of selling this stuff on pennies on a dollar every taxpayer should be [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  What's an act hate toward the country? Of course, well, yeah, you know, I've said many times they hate Trump more than they love the country [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1468.5600000000002s)]
*  for sure [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1474.6000000000001s)]
*  And I think they hate the country more than they hate Trump even he represents the country to them the old country that they tried [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1476.24s)]
*  to change with immigration [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1481.24s)]
*  Do you know my orcas I know how would you assess him? I used to respect him [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1483.92s)]
*  Under President Obama I [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1490.2s)]
*  Got I got a presidential rank award under President Obama because I oversaw the removal of you know well over a million [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1495.08s)]
*  aliens during that three-year period [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1502.96s)]
*  My orcas actually accompanied me on operations in New York City targeting [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1507.08s)]
*  criminal aliens and illegal aliens both [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1514.44s)]
*  I [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1517.02s)]
*  Know [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1522.28s)]
*  I never knew that these older people were supposed to come and get out of their homes [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1525.16s)]
*  When they were gonna do something big like tout trade [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1529.9s)]
*  Then he said the biggest reason he came is when He演 illegal aliens [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1536.46s)]
*  on is the transgender policy where you want special treatment for transgenders [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1542.16s)]
*  and ICE detention. I was ordered to sign that policy and that's... [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1546.16s)]
*  What kind of special treatment? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1548.96s)]
*  Making sure they're identified as being a transgender, they're protected in our facilities and separated and get medical attention [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1550.16s)]
*  whether it's hormone therapy or whatever it was. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1560.66s)]
*  Which he wanted the US government to pay for hormone therapy? [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1562.66s)]
*  Yeah, and we got a huge argument over that and I was ordered to sign the memo and that's where kind of where it had fallen out. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1565.66s)]
*  Do you have any... why would he want... I mean first of all how many transsexual illegal aliens are there? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1571.66s)]
*  You'd be surprised how many we run across and they just you know they wanted certain protections for our facilities. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1577.66s)]
*  But Alejandro Mayorkas went on an operation with me. He shook hands of officers who were enforcing immigration law. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1585.66s)]
*  I remember we went to New York City on a huge operation, arrested a lot of illegal aliens. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1593.66s)]
*  And when he was nominated to be secretary I thought okay we're in the middle of this crisis again, right? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1597.66s)]
*  He knows how we stopped it. We stopped it by building detention facilities including family residential centers, you know the so-called cages, right? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1603.66s)]
*  He knew how we stopped it. We stopped by building more detention facilities, detaining people, making them have a hearing [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1611.66s)]
*  because if you're in detention you have a hearing within like 35 days. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1616.16s)]
*  Nine out of ten lost, we put them in an airplane, sent them home and the board numbers tanked. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1619.16s)]
*  So I'm thinking okay, he knows how to fix it. He might be able to do this job. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1623.16s)]
*  He got into the job. It's a complete 180. I don't recognize him anymore. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1627.16s)]
*  He's about not enforcing law. One of his first instructions to ICE is that being in the country illegally on its own is not enough for you to go make an arrest. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1631.16s)]
*  You got to wait till they're convicted of a serious criminal violation. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1642.16s)]
*  How can a federal administrator ignore federal law? Isn't that unconstitutional? Why can't he be arrested for that? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1645.16s)]
*  I mean the Fifth Circuit, federal judge in the Fifth Circuit said not only are they ignoring the law, they're actually violating the law. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1653.66s)]
*  Again, that's when we need to hold these people accountable in the incoming administration. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1659.66s)]
*  I believe they violated the law. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1664.66s)]
*  The fact that Congress never did anything about that is really telling me. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1666.66s)]
*  Well they went through the impeachment proceedings and I said at the time, I think we had five or six Republican Congressmen, they didn't vote for impeachment. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1670.66s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. I thought they lost the right to be a congressman at that point. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1679.16s)]
*  If they can impeach President Trump for making a phone call, you can't impeach Alejandro Mayorkas for what he did to this border? [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1683.16s)]
*  The biggest national security vulnerability this nation has ever seen? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1690.16s)]
*  Look, me and Christopher Wray, I'm not a friend of his, I don't really respect the man much, but he agrees with me that the border has become the biggest vulnerability this nation has ever seen. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1693.16s)]
*  He sees more red flags than ever before and they continue with the open border even to this day after the election. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1702.16s)]
*  I think they're going to sell border wall material that we're going to need and day one we're getting in there. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1708.66s)]
*  The illegal behavior, the treasonous behavior of this administration has not stopped. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1712.66s)]
*  What do you think happened? It's so interesting. I'm glad I asked you if you knew him. I didn't know that you did. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1720.66s)]
*  But since you do, what do you think happened to Mayorkas? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1725.66s)]
*  As an agent since 1984, I think we study people, that's what we do. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1730.16s)]
*  Either he fooled me under the Obama administration and he actually believed in enforcement, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1736.16s)]
*  either I was hoodwinked and just thought he was behind enforcement or he always felt that way. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1742.16s)]
*  And just he played the role under the Obama administration, then when he came back he actually did what he always truly believed in, open borders. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1749.16s)]
*  I know the NGOs and he has a very close relationship. He worked with some NGOs before he came back. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1758.66s)]
*  So I don't know what happened. All I know is a man who at once respected, I have zero respect for him because of what he's done. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1764.66s)]
*  Again, not because of incompetence, this is my design. They knew exactly what they were doing. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1772.66s)]
*  Because he's been there before. He knows how we shut it down, he knows how we secure the border at a high level. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1776.66s)]
*  Not as high as Trump, we secure the border at a pretty good level. He did everything he could to unsecure the border, which is a complete 180. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1783.16s)]
*  It's fascinating. There's something, you watch when he talks, there's something strange, very, well first of all he's lying. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1791.16s)]
*  He's lying under oath, which is a felony too. If I lie under oath, they would love to prosecute me for lying under oath. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1799.16s)]
*  And they should, you shouldn't be allowed to do that. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1805.16s)]
*  One of the biggest statements he made was, for those who don't immediately qualify for asylum, they'll be immediately removed. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1807.66s)]
*  Really? You've got the lowest numbers of removals in the history of ICE. At the same time, you have historic illegal immigration. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1814.66s)]
*  So, you know, he was supposed to have a hearing a couple weeks ago and I asked a couple of congressmen to ask that question again. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1821.66s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of anti-Trump, anti-Homeland rhetoric out there that we shouldn't have a mass deportation operation. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1827.66s)]
*  Do you stand by the statements you've made numerous times that if they don't qualify, they need to be removed? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1835.16s)]
*  Because you can also help send a message to the American people, we're doing this deportation operation. It has to be done. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1839.16s)]
*  And you said it. Would you say that again? Of course, him and Ray Bakhtari never had the hearing. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1844.16s)]
*  But for the American people, we don't see, here's my biggest issue. I read it every day. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1850.16s)]
*  Racists, inhumane, to have a mass deportation operation. We just went through four years of historic illegal immigration again. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1856.66s)]
*  We're nine out of ten to get an order removal. We don't have a choice. That's where the law is set up. They lose their case, they're going home. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1864.66s)]
*  Why is that racist? I mean, we just ended African American political power, by the way, because of the demographic changes. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1871.66s)]
*  Just basically made it, you know, both parties have paid, especially the Democratic Party, a lot of attention to what black voters want because they're a huge part of the Democratic coalition. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1878.16s)]
*  And now that's not true. And so it's not, this is a complicated question. Anyone who says, oh, it's just white racism is, what is your average black person in Chicago, native born, family been here 300 years, what does he think of watching his city overwhelm with illegal aliens? [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1888.16s)]
*  Exactly what they think. I was up in Chicago last week. I met with hundreds. I met with black pastors. Black pastors are upset. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1896.66s)]
*  Well, they should be upset. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1900.66s)]
*  They feel like, you know, people who are not supposed to be here enter the country illegally, which is a crime. I'm going to keep talking about that. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1902.66s)]
*  Are getting massive amounts of care, right? Free hotel room, three square meals a day, free medical care. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1908.66s)]
*  And the black community feels left behind because a lot of these people are, you know, they could use some of that tax money in Chicago to help them. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1915.16s)]
*  And their taxpayers, they should have the first chance to get some of that help. But the mayor of Chicago, you know, he's ignoring his own community. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1923.16s)]
*  And I was up there, you know, I was up there with the mayor, and I was up there with the mayor. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1929.16s)]
*  And I was up there with the mayor. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1933.16s)]
*  And I was up there with the mayor, and I was up there with the mayor. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1935.16s)]
*  But the mayor of Chicago, you know, he's ignoring his own community. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1939.66s)]
*  And I was up there just over a week ago, and I met with hundreds of people that were up there. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1943.66s)]
*  And they're suffering because the decision is to take care of these illegal aliens. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1949.66s)]
*  I mean, I saw city transit buses parked, running fuel, there's warming buses. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1955.66s)]
*  How about taking care of the homeless people in that city? Let them get on a warming bus. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1961.66s)]
*  They'd rather put these illegal aliens in a hotel room at $500 a night in the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City, [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1968.16s)]
*  and give them three meals a day and give them free medical care, rather than take care of their own people. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1974.16s)]
*  We got homeless vets. You've been to Washington, D.C. many times. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1978.16s)]
*  Less than a mile from the Capitol, you got homeless vets living in tents. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1982.16s)]
*  They don't have a free hotel room. They don't get a hot shower. They don't get three squares a day. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1986.16s)]
*  They don't have access to free medical care. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1990.16s)]
*  People in the country illegally get all that stuff. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1994.66s)]
*  Well, yeah. And they also, you know, this is a democracy, so we make decisions based on population size. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=1998.66s)]
*  And if you dilute the population, you dilute the political power of the people who are born here, very much including black people. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2004.66s)]
*  So really, it's a takeover of our government, of our democratic system. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2010.66s)]
*  And I just want to say for the third time, it completely disenfranchises black people. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2016.66s)]
*  They're black leaders in Congress who supposedly speak for black people. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2021.16s)]
*  They sold them right out, actually, in fact. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2025.16s)]
*  And then the violence in these communities, and we're trying to address the violence. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2027.16s)]
*  Mayor Allen finally gets it, I think. We'll see what he actually does. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2031.16s)]
*  But the mayor of Chicago, Chicago, the crime rate is extremely high in Chicago, right? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2035.16s)]
*  We know the shootings are outrageous. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2039.16s)]
*  And what we're saying to him, President Trump and myself have been very clear. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2041.16s)]
*  We want to prioritize those illegally in the country that are public safety threats. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2045.16s)]
*  That's what we want to target first, because they're the most dangerous to our community. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2050.66s)]
*  Public safety threats and that's security threats. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2052.66s)]
*  Why would any elected mayor of a city with a crime rate as high as they have not want public safety threats taken out of their communities? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2054.66s)]
*  Especially if they're here illegally. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2063.66s)]
*  You would think the mayor of Chicago has the number one responsibility is the safety of his community. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2065.66s)]
*  Why not help me take those public safety threats out of the community? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2072.66s)]
*  ICE agents aren't allowed to take a step into County Jail, one of the biggest County Jails in the country. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2076.16s)]
*  Where we used to get hundreds of illegal alien criminals out, we can't even step foot in that. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2081.16s)]
*  They won't honor an ICE detainer. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2085.16s)]
*  They'd much rather release that public safety threat back in the community to re-offend. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2087.16s)]
*  And where is he likely to re-offend? The immigrant community, where he lives. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2091.16s)]
*  But I don't understand. I mean, so when South Carolina tried this in 1861 at Forest Sumter, it kicked off a civil war. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2095.16s)]
*  When Central High School tried this in 1957 in Little Rock, Arkansas, Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2102.66s)]
*  You can't allow states to ignore federal law. I'm trying not to use the F word here. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2109.66s)]
*  So how is that not an act of insurrection? I don't understand. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2114.66s)]
*  If a mayor or a governor says, you know, we're going to ignore federal law and there's nothing you can do, you can't come into our facility. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2118.66s)]
*  How about you get a SEAL team and go into the facility? I mean, like, how is that allowed? That is insurrection. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2125.66s)]
*  Am I missing something? I thought this is the way the system worked. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2131.16s)]
*  That's why I've been out there taking a lot of hate the last three weeks, saying, okay, well... [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2133.16s)]
*  You're taking hate from the insurrectionists? [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2137.16s)]
*  Yeah. Which I'll wear as a badge of honor. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2139.16s)]
*  I've been out there saying one thing to the mayor of Denver, right? [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2142.16s)]
*  To the mayor of Chicago and to Governor Pritzker and the rest of them. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2148.16s)]
*  You cannot help. You can choose not to help us. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2153.66s)]
*  Stand aside because we're going to do it. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2157.66s)]
*  However, there's a line you can't cross. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2161.66s)]
*  If you're going to impede what we're doing, that's a felony. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2163.66s)]
*  If you're going to noyly harbor and conceal an illegal alien from ICE agents, US 1324 to apply, that's a felony. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2167.66s)]
*  And we will prosecute. We're done playing the game. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2175.66s)]
*  There are federal statutes on the books written by Congress, enacted by Congress, signed by the president, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2180.16s)]
*  saying this is a felony to do these things and we're going to take that seriously. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2186.16s)]
*  And we've got a strong AG coming in, Pam Bondi, I think will back me up on this. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2189.16s)]
*  You can sit aside and watch us do your work for you. Fine, you do it. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2193.16s)]
*  But here's the message. No one's asking you to be immigration officers. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2198.16s)]
*  What we're asking is give us access to the taxpayer-funded jail, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2203.16s)]
*  where you already locked somebody in a jail cell because apparently they're a public safety threat. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2207.66s)]
*  When you're done with them, simply give them to us. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2211.66s)]
*  And we're removing them now only from the community, from the country. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2215.66s)]
*  Because when you don't, and here's what they're going to get, they're going to get exactly what they don't want by taking this stance. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2219.66s)]
*  You don't let me into jail with the rest of the bad guy where one agent can arrest a bad guy in the safety and security of a county jail [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2225.66s)]
*  where we know he don't have access to weapons. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2230.66s)]
*  You're going to release them back in the community. You're endangering the community, the immigrant community, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2234.16s)]
*  because most likely to re-offend in that community. You're endangering our officers. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2239.16s)]
*  And you're endangering that alien because things could happen when you're making arrests in a public setting. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2243.16s)]
*  We have access to who knows what weapons, right? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2247.16s)]
*  So what's Tom Homan going to do? We're going to send more agents to the community. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2250.16s)]
*  We're going to find a guy. So that means I've got to send a whole team to the community to find him. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2254.16s)]
*  We send a team because of officer safety concerns. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2258.16s)]
*  We send a team to find him. When we find him, he's probably going to be with others. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2261.66s)]
*  Others are not necessarily an operational priority, but guess what? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2265.66s)]
*  Ice agents aren't going to be told to turn their back on any illegal handling. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2268.66s)]
*  So we're going to find the bad guy and anybody else around him. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2271.66s)]
*  So by your actions, and not letting me in that county jail means more agents in your neighborhood, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2274.66s)]
*  a lot more agents in your neighborhood, and a lot more arrests and many non-priority arrests. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2279.66s)]
*  You want to play the game, we're going to play the game. That's the result you're going to get. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2284.66s)]
*  I can't believe to this day that any elected governor, Governor Pritzker, says you've got to come through me. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2289.16s)]
*  No problem. We can do that. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2294.16s)]
*  Why would you not want to help remove public safety threats? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2296.16s)]
*  This should be no question. If you have your opinion on illegal immigration, we're talking about criminals. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2300.16s)]
*  Well, to the extent that he allows officers in his state to violate federal law, Pritzker's a criminal. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2305.16s)]
*  Any governor who willingly flouts federal law, again, this is why we had a civil war in the United States in 1861, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2313.66s)]
*  because South Carolina did this. So I don't know why we would ever put up with that for one second from any governor, a Republican or Democrat. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2321.66s)]
*  President Trump administration will not put up with that. That's why I've been signing a warning shout out. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2327.66s)]
*  This is not going to be tolerated. We're going to take action. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2331.66s)]
*  American lives are at stake here. This president, I think, has been given a mandate by American people. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2335.16s)]
*  Apparently the results of the election has no influence on many of these people. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2344.16s)]
*  Mayor Adams reached out to me, and I actually went to Mayor Adams. He understands it. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2348.16s)]
*  And I think he realizes that we're taking it seriously. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2353.16s)]
*  Eric Adams from New York reached out to you. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2356.16s)]
*  Reached out to me. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2358.16s)]
*  Good for him. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2359.16s)]
*  He believes he should take public safety threats out of his communities, too. He's offering to help us. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2360.66s)]
*  He's offering to let me in the Rikers Island jail. We've been kicked out of Rikers Island jail for years. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2365.66s)]
*  Again, like, kind of, we used to arrest hundreds of illegal aliens with criminal convictions there. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2370.66s)]
*  Eric Adams says he's going to go as far as writing an executive order to get us back in Rikers Island, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2375.66s)]
*  because he agrees with me that Mayor de Blasio did a lot of harm that affected the public safety in New York City. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2379.66s)]
*  He's getting a lot of pushback from the city council. I saw him the other day. He says, you know, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2387.16s)]
*  you can cancel me if you want, but this is the right thing to do for public safety in New Yorkers. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2391.16s)]
*  He also said he would assist me in finding over 300,000 missing children, which many are going to be in New York City. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2395.16s)]
*  With Donald Trump returning to the White House, this country has a unique opportunity, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2401.16s)]
*  maybe our last opportunity, to save ourselves from the anti-American and anti-human left. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2405.16s)]
*  But our efforts may be stymied by the deep state. That's what happened to the first Trump term, permanent Washington. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2412.16s)]
*  Stands in the way of all efforts to improve the lives of ordinary Americans, and right now they are scheming to do the same thing to the second Trump administration. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2421.66s)]
*  They are determined to keep their stranglehold on power, regardless of elections, anti-democratically. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2431.66s)]
*  That is a fact. So what do you do to fight them? How do you defeat the deep state? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2437.66s)]
*  Well, one way you can is by supporting the Heritage Foundation, which is in Washington and understands exactly how it works, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2444.16s)]
*  in such a way that they're a threat and they're under attack. You know who's effective because they're the ones under attack. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2450.16s)]
*  Heritage has a comprehensive plan to dismantle permanent Washington and restore the country to its democratic foundations. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2456.16s)]
*  That's important. Visit heritage.org.uk to learn more and to support this critical effort. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2464.66s)]
*  When you make a gift today, you get a free pocket constitution to make certain that you are equipped with the founding principles on your person at all times. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2471.66s)]
*  It's amazing to read it. Again, that's heritage.org.uk. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2479.66s)]
*  So let me ask you about Adams. I talked to him the other day. He seemed pretty reasonable to me. I don't agree with him on a lot. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2483.66s)]
*  But on the other hand, he didn't seem crazy. And my impression is that he was indicted on what seemed like pretty silly charges by the feds because he complained about immigration in New York. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2492.16s)]
*  I think that's what he thinks happened. Do you think that's possible? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2505.16s)]
*  I absolutely do. Yes. And when I sat down with him, it was all about public safety. Other stuff never came up. The cop at him came out. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2508.16s)]
*  And look, I've been calling him out for three years saying he forgot what it's like to be a cop and became a politician. He's not helping with this crisis. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2516.66s)]
*  But when he reached out to me, I sat down with him. I saw that first time ever. I saw the cop, the career cop come out and say, look, this is, this is, this should be controversial. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2523.66s)]
*  I want to work with you on this. He goes, we're not going to be immigration officers. I'm not going to help you round up illegal aliens. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2533.16s)]
*  I said, I don't want to be an immigration officer. I want cops to work with cops to remove public safety threats. He gets it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2540.66s)]
*  And he says he's going to take some executive actions. So I hope he does because that's going to make New York City much safer, not only for the community, but for my officers. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2546.66s)]
*  My biggest threat is you're going to force us into community arrest bad guys when we could arrest them in a safety and security of a jail. That puts our guys at grave risk. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2555.66s)]
*  So same with the board of agents. The criminal cartels can be put out of business by President Trump, which means the violence is going to rise on the southern border. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2565.16s)]
*  Well, that's right. And it's also, if you think about it, and I know you have thought about it, I think it's safer for everyone to have your guys arresting illegals in the Sonoran Desert than in Times Square. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2574.16s)]
*  I mean, that's scary in a crowded city. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2584.16s)]
*  And these men and women, they're going to put their lives on the line every day. And again, I can't believe any politician left, right, middle would want to put these officers at risk when there's a better way to do this. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2587.66s)]
*  When I first started in this game back in the 1980s, I never heard the word of sanctuary city. We got in every county jail. Everybody worked there. I can't believe we're at the time now. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2599.66s)]
*  My father was a cop. My grandmother was a cop. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2609.66s)]
*  And father was a cop? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2612.66s)]
*  Yep. I knew I was going to be a cop. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2613.66s)]
*  Where were the cops? [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2616.16s)]
*  In upstate New York. So, in my day, cops were respected. Police officers were respected. Now, you fast forward now, and these politicians, if you enforce the law, all of a sudden you become the bad guy. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2617.16s)]
*  And if you break the law, you're the victim. That's truly what it is in some of these cities. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2631.16s)]
*  It's weird that Republicans put up with that acts of insurrection. I mean, they've been yammering about the insurrection of January 6th, but a sanctuary city is a bold, unequivocal move toward insurrection. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2637.66s)]
*  You're saying, I'm not obeying federal law. And no one did anything about it. They made fun of them on Fox News, but they didn't send the 101st Airborne. I don't understand why. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2651.66s)]
*  President Trump's going to take a hard stance. I think he'll take, one of the things, take their federal funding away. I think that's going to bring a lot of people to the table because they need that money. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2662.16s)]
*  And plus, I think it gets down to, if they MP, if they normally harbor, I think we need to prosecute members. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2670.16s)]
*  I said this when I was ice director, that they ought to be held accountable and DOJ needs to look at criminal prosecution. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2677.16s)]
*  Of course, the media went crazy. Holman's calling the lockup politicians. What I call for is DOJ. I'm not an attorney, but I, as an agent, many years ago, I've arrested United States citizens for annoyingly harboring, concealing, and illegal aliening their home. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2685.66s)]
*  I arrested U.S. citizens for harboring, concealing, and illegal aliening their place of business. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2700.66s)]
*  If I can arrest U.S. citizens for violating those crimes, why can't I arrest a mayor or a governor who's given his staff explicit instructions to impede us and to hide from us? [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2706.16s)]
*  I mean, the mayor of Adams came around the city. He had a police force at the city boundaries preventing us from coming in, right? That was one of the comments he made. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2717.16s)]
*  Now, he's walked in back because he made a statement he's willing to go to jail, and I responded, well, I'm willing to put you in jail if that's what it comes to. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2724.16s)]
*  I'm not looking for a fight with these people, but I'm not going to run away from one, either. We're going to enforce this law. We're going to do what the American people wants us to do. We're going to enforce the law. We're going to run this deportation operation. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2731.66s)]
*  If you don't want to help, get the hell out of the way. But if you impede us, then we need to prosecute these people and send a message. This is no longer acceptable to anybody. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2742.66s)]
*  It should never have been acceptable, but under the Trump administration, we're not playing that game. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2753.66s)]
*  It's not even about, on some level, immigration. It's about holding the country together. If parts of the country decide we're just not following the federal laws because we don't feel like it, then how is it a country? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2757.16s)]
*  Lake and Riley would be alive today if we had a better relationship in New York City. A killer was arrested in New York City for the injury of a child. If we had the relationship we used to have, they would have turned him over to ICE. ICE would have detained him and removed him. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2768.66s)]
*  But instead he went to Georgia and killed him. If President Trump was president, he wouldn't even be in the United States. He'd be in Mexico and the Remain in Mexico program would never have been released into the United States. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2784.16s)]
*  Giving a free hotel, giving a monthly stipend for food and expenses. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2797.16s)]
*  Free cell phone, airplane tickets. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2801.16s)]
*  It's just incredible where we're at today, but I've got full confidence in myself and President Trump. I'm working very closely with Steve Miller, brilliant architect of the most successful border policy this country has ever had. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2803.66s)]
*  What's his position going to be? [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2814.66s)]
*  He's the deputy chief of staff. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2816.66s)]
*  I'm a senior advisor to the president, term, border czar. Not my term, but they're nicknamed it. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2818.66s)]
*  I can guarantee you Tucker, and to your listeners, this border czar is going to do a hell of a lot better than our last border czar. I've already been to the border three times and I'm not even in Auschwitz yet. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2827.16s)]
*  I cannot resist asking you, what are these drones in New Jersey? [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2839.16s)]
*  I don't know. I've talked to people in the intelligence community. Some think it's, some are from an Iranian ship, but I haven't got access to intelligence reports. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2843.66s)]
*  I know one thing. Maybe the news is right. Maybe they're surveying the drone, maybe they're all legal. I just find it hard to believe. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2857.66s)]
*  I can't believe this administration has taken action on it. I guarantee you if President Trump was sitting there over the office, everyone would have blown out the sky by now. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2867.16s)]
*  I don't know factually because I don't see the intelligence reports. I'm not in yet, but I find it highly suspicious that the administration is saying they're all legal and lawful and that they pose no harm to the communities. I don't buy it. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2875.16s)]
*  Do you think that other members of the incoming Trump administration have been briefed on what the current administration thinks they are? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2891.66s)]
*  I do not know. I'm hoping they have. I mean they should have, but I don't know. I just saw one congressman from New Jersey said he got information from an Iranian summer. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2898.66s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2908.66s)]
*  And I've also talked to friends in the intelligence community that off the record taught the same thing, but I have no direct knowledge of it. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2909.66s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2918.66s)]
*  I guarantee you within a few days that Trump will get to the White House and we're going to find out. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2921.16s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that to be true. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2925.16s)]
*  So you've described, I think really well, the problem and how you plan to secure the border. The deportations, that was the second goal that you had of three. How many of those 12 million do you think are eligible can be deported? [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2930.16s)]
*  We know there's right now we got over 1.7 million with final orders of removal already been ordered to be removed that haven't been removed. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2948.66s)]
*  Okay, so that's just a gimme. That's easy. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2957.66s)]
*  We got 700,000, 780,000 illegal aliens with criminal convictions. They're going to be priority one. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2959.66s)]
*  Then we got criminals, security threats and fugitives. These are the ones I talked to 1.7. I think the last number was of people who had due process, a great taxpayer expense order removed. They need to go. We'll find them. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2968.16s)]
*  Then we take the rest. I mean, everybody says how many illegal aliens can you remove in a year? I don't know. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2982.16s)]
*  I'll find out when I get into office. How many positions do I have? What does my money look like? How much money do I have to buy beds? [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2988.16s)]
*  We need detention beds. People always say you don't arrest somebody and just deport them that day. We have to detain them and work out arrangements for their home country to get travel documents. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=2995.66s)]
*  They have to accept that, yeah, they're a national of ours and there's a process we go through anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. So we have to detain these people. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3003.66s)]
*  So how many beds can I fortify by? Because if I don't have beds, it's going to be hard to do this. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3010.66s)]
*  How much money do I have for transportation contracts, whether over the ground or in the air? And can other agencies be involved? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3015.66s)]
*  I know I specifically have requested that DOD be involved. They can do non-enforcement duty. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3025.16s)]
*  What that does is, so the officers wearing a badge and gun with immigration authority, they shouldn't be driving a bus. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3033.16s)]
*  They shouldn't be building infrastructure on the southwest border, south side facilities. They shouldn't be doing the intelligence. They shouldn't be doing the targeting, right? [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3040.16s)]
*  As much non-enforcement work as possible, contract that out, have DOD do a lot of it, and that releases those badges and guns to the street where they're really needed. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3048.66s)]
*  So what other agencies are involved? Is DOD going to be a part of this, take off the non-enforcement duties off our shoulders? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3057.66s)]
*  So hopefully I'll find out really fast what we have. I know right now, my sources at ICE, they're already $300 million in the hole. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3063.66s)]
*  So I'm hoping Congress will provide us with huge funding through the conciliation process. That's my hopes. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3074.16s)]
*  And I know I talked to Lindsey Graham yesterday. Or deportation. Yeah, Lindsey Graham yesterday said he's working on a astronomical bill. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3083.16s)]
*  It'll be more money than we've ever seen before. I hope that's true. I just don't want to be held up in this tax bill, because that's going to take six or eight months, and it gets watered down by the time we get it, and it's just ridiculous. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3090.16s)]
*  Have you, I mean, is there some legal way to designate Americans just for a temporary period as Ukrainians, and just tell the Congress that money's going to Ukrainians? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3100.66s)]
*  That would expedite it, don't you think? Here's $200 billion. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3111.66s)]
*  They're spending money defending the Ukrainian border, but it would be nice if they gave us just a piece of that actually, because they got a lot of money. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3115.66s)]
*  I'm hoping and praying that this is going to be different than the first Trump administration when he had the Senate and the House the first two years. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3121.66s)]
*  I'm hoping they come to the table and I'll help this president succeed. So funding is paramount. We're only going to be as successful as the funding we're given to get this job done. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3129.16s)]
*  Well, I can, I'm no expert, but I know members of Congress, most of them, and I know that they only respond to pain, unfortunately. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3139.16s)]
*  And you just have to threaten them, and you're going to lose your seat, and we're going to call you out by name and make you unpopular in your state, and your career will be over unless you obey immediately. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3146.16s)]
*  Normal people, you can reason with normal people, and love motivates people. I doubt in your house you and your wife are threatening each other. You probably love each other, saying nice things to each other. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3155.66s)]
*  But members of Congress are not normal people, and you really just have to grab them by the face and say, do this or suffer, and they will respond to that. So I hope you will do that. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3165.66s)]
*  There's a lot of media outlets right now, I think they're trying to shame us saying how expensive this operation is going to be. It's just incredible. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3174.66s)]
*  More expensive than letting in 12 billion people and giving them cell phones and food vouchers and free medical care, destroying our hospitals. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3184.16s)]
*  First of all, what price do you put on national security? What price do you put on Lake and Raleigh's life and so many other little girls? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3190.16s)]
*  It's going to be a cost savings for American people, because right now we're spending billions of dollars on a free airline ticket, free hotel room, not even mentioning the cost of schools and trauma centers and hospitals and social services, in perpetuity. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3195.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to be expensive. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3209.66s)]
*  Well, they destroyed rural America. I mean, it's flat out. I live there. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3211.66s)]
*  It will be expensive to get out of the gate, but in the long run we're going to save American taxpayers billions of dollars by getting this country back to the rule of law. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3214.66s)]
*  What's the point of a government except to ensure safety and tranquility for its people? I mean, what is the point? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3221.66s)]
*  Other than to obviously kick out Assad and secure the borders of Ukraine, which are the top priorities I think listed in the Constitution. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3227.66s)]
*  But after that, taking care of your own people seems to be important also. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3235.16s)]
*  Well, that's why President Trump won this election. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3239.16s)]
*  He's put America first. That's why I came. This is the second time I came back from retirement to serve this president, because like I said, I've been doing this a long time and I'm at the point now where I wake up every day pissed off. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3242.16s)]
*  The first day I woke up, the smile on my face was the day after the election, because I knew we can fix this. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3255.66s)]
*  By fixing it, you save lives. Secure borders save lives. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3261.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3264.66s)]
*  Even when you get 100% of the agents on the line doing their job rather than changing diapers, making baby formula, making hospital runs, more fentanyl seeds means less fentanyl deaths. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3265.66s)]
*  Less people, less gout aways, which means less sex trafficking on women and children, less known as suspected terrorists. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3278.16s)]
*  Even the wall saves lives. And people say, Trump's vanity wall. No, that's America's wall, first of all. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3284.16s)]
*  Every place they build a border barrier, illegal immigration reduced, illegal drug flow reduced. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3289.16s)]
*  What people don't want to talk about is how many lives it saves. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3294.16s)]
*  The most vulnerable of those that come to the country, women and children, can't get over that wall. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3298.16s)]
*  Which means they're going to a place where there's not a wall. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3302.16s)]
*  And what's waiting on them? The men and women wearing that green uniform, the finest 1% this country has, who are going to take care of their medical needs first, because they're in a lot of bad shape when they get there. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3305.66s)]
*  Men and women in the border patrol save thousands of lives every year. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3314.66s)]
*  Of course, the left wants to calm haters and storm troopers, and they want to slander the men in the horse patrol for what they did. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3317.66s)]
*  And still no apology to the state. Men and women in the border patrol save a lot of lives. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3327.66s)]
*  The war wall saves lives. And under the Trump administration, the number of deaths were very, very low. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3333.16s)]
*  Both Americans and illegal aliens. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3338.16s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, I think we're just short of 4,000 aliens that have died crossing the border. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3341.16s)]
*  While you and I are talking right now, while you and I are having this discussion, women are being raped. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3346.16s)]
*  And members of the cartels, as part of the crossing through that border, a child is going to die today. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3351.16s)]
*  Either drown in a river or be lost in the ditch, or abandoned by these cartels. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3357.66s)]
*  They think the government's getting close to them. They'll dump people and save their own skin. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3361.66s)]
*  Look how many children have been abandoned at the border. Border patrols found a lot of them. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3366.66s)]
*  I guarantee you border patrol didn't find all of them. There's some toddlers they're going to find someday. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3370.66s)]
*  So it's so evil. I mean, I know that in El Salvador, when MS-13 ran the country before Bukele, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3374.66s)]
*  there was a religious component of voodoo witchcraft component to MS-13, where they were worshiping the devil. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3384.16s)]
*  I mean, openly. It's a component of the cartels. You see it in Mexico as well, through Latin America. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3390.16s)]
*  Have you come across that? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3397.16s)]
*  Yeah. They worship death. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3399.16s)]
*  Like, formally worship it though? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3403.16s)]
*  Yeah. There's, I'm going to call them religious. Some places, even the Texas DPS have found some of these places where the cartels were operating. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3406.66s)]
*  They got statues there and memorabilia, worshiping death as a consequence of not allowing them to do their business. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3417.66s)]
*  Right. And these are from cultures that have practiced human sacrifice for thousands of years. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3428.66s)]
*  I got a video on my phone showing a member of the cartel skinning a man alive, skinning him alive on video, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3433.16s)]
*  to send a message to anybody. If you push back on the cartels, if you're snitching the cartels, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3442.16s)]
*  they're not going to just kill you. They're going to make you suffer immensely. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3449.16s)]
*  I got sent this video by someone in the intelligence community. And I'm a pretty tough guy, but I can't watch the whole video. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3453.16s)]
*  No, of course not. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3458.16s)]
*  When they skin somebody alive and the pain that man went through, this is what they do. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3459.66s)]
*  This is why MS-13, they don't just shoot somebody. They hack them up. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3463.66s)]
*  Me and President Trump, remember when we did Operation Matador in Long Island, we arrested just short of 500 gang members and a lot of MS-13. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3467.66s)]
*  During the press conference, President Trump referred to these people as animals. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3474.66s)]
*  And of course Nancy Pelosi, the rest of the people went nuts. These are people he referred to as animals. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3478.66s)]
*  She's an animal, actually. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3482.66s)]
*  Then they came to me and I said, I don't know what President Trump has against animals, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3484.16s)]
*  but animals kill to survive. MS-13 kills for pleasure. They're much worse than animals. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3488.16s)]
*  Well, it's witchcraft. It's human sacrifice. And again, they're from cultures that have practiced it for, well, since the beginning of recorded history. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3493.16s)]
*  When they turn into Agua and the rest of them, they're on notice. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3502.66s)]
*  There are days of coming over here and committing crimes and victimizing this country over. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3507.66s)]
*  And a lot of people are pushing back and say, well, you can't remove them to Venezuela. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3514.66s)]
*  They're going to be removed. And if Venezuela won't take them, well, it's in someplace south, but they're not staying here. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3518.66s)]
*  So turning into Agua has done a lot of harm in this country, as you know. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3523.66s)]
*  The rape, murder of little girls and the theft and the organized crime they've instilled in major cities in this country. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3528.16s)]
*  President Trump put them on notice. Our gang is bigger than their gang. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3536.16s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3541.16s)]
*  Take them out of business. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3542.16s)]
*  When phone companies say they're selling something for free, they really mean see the fine print. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3543.16s)]
*  You're going to need thick glasses to read it. Once you read it, you realize the product is not free at all, far from it. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3548.16s)]
*  To qualify for those programs, you need to check all kinds of predetermined boxes that are often expensive. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3555.16s)]
*  It's a scam. Don't fall for it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3561.16s)]
*  Pure Talk has a better option. Get a brand new iPhone 14 plus unlimited talk, text, 15 gigs of data and more for 50 bucks a month. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3564.16s)]
*  Free? No. Real? Yes. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3574.66s)]
*  It's transparent and the value is obvious. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3578.66s)]
*  So half the price of the big corporations, you get a new iPhone powered by America's most dependable 5G network. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3582.16s)]
*  Go to puretalk.com slash Tucker and you save an additional 50% off on your first month. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3589.16s)]
*  Pure Talk, America's wireless company. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3595.16s)]
*  I remember in the first Trump administration, the US military refused, flat out refused, generals refused to secure the border. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3598.16s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3605.16s)]
*  It's a shame. I mean, DOD's helped a lot of administrations. They helped the Obama administration. They helped the Clinton administration. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3609.16s)]
*  What's the point of sending them a trillion and a half dollars every year? Is there a reason that we do that? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3615.16s)]
*  Well, I think we've proven that the southwest border is a huge national security vulnerability. I think it's the perfect place for the military to be. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3620.16s)]
*  Yeah, bigger than Syria, I would say. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3628.16s)]
*  It's more of a national security vulnerability than Ukraine or Syria or anyplace else. So I think President Trump's not going to take no for an answer. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3630.16s)]
*  He is the president of the United States. He's going to make this work. And DOD will be a part of this operation. We need them. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3636.16s)]
*  We can make a bigger impact if they can do some of the things that don't require a badge and gun for us and that puts more badge and guns on the street. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3642.16s)]
*  The rest are bad guys. They're an imperative part of this operation. Other agencies. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3649.16s)]
*  We're going to need help from, you know, I'd like to see the US Marshals be a part of that, the FBI be a part of it. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3654.16s)]
*  I've gotten, I've actually shut down my LinkedIn account because I've gotten thousands of thousands, retired border agents, retired ICE agents, retired police officers, retired military all want to come back and help this operation. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3661.16s)]
*  And I'm hoping we can rehire a lot of these people, rehire the newtons. But, you know, especially the retired border police and ICE agents, they know the Fourth Amendment. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3675.16s)]
*  They know they can do and don't do. I'm speak Spanish. They know how to use the processing systems. They know the game. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3683.16s)]
*  They're good at it. So I was one of the first time when we work and I was bringing a lot of these retired agents back and let them help us do this job. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3688.16s)]
*  They're educated in immigration enforcement. They hit the ground running. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3694.16s)]
*  I should have asked you at the outset, but of the 12 million that you described, you came here illegally under Biden. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3699.16s)]
*  Where were they from? Roughly 181 different countries. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3705.16s)]
*  So how does I won't ask. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3709.16s)]
*  That's almost every country in the world. Think about it. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3711.16s)]
*  It's what I think there were 199, you know, so there were none from Vanuatu or Seychelles, but the rest came. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3714.16s)]
*  But how was the breakdown like you think of illegal immigration and what when I was a kid, it was from Mexico. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3722.16s)]
*  I don't think it is anymore. Then it was Central America. Then it was South America. Roughly. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3728.16s)]
*  What was the breakdown? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3734.16s)]
*  Mexican still read or national Mexico still lead. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3736.16s)]
*  Oh, really? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3739.16s)]
*  Yeah. Al Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, close second. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3740.16s)]
*  I mean, those four countries make up a majority. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3745.16s)]
*  But what concerns me is the country that we never had much activity from. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3748.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3753.16s)]
*  You know, 46,000 Chinese. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3754.16s)]
*  What's that? [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3756.16s)]
*  It scares the hell out of me because a lot of them are military age males. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3758.16s)]
*  46,000 military age males don't leave China without the coordination to prove the Chinese government. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3762.16s)]
*  That just don't happen. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3768.16s)]
*  Russians, we got over. I think last look I have 27,000 Russians, people from Turkey, Syria, Iran, Iraq. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3770.16s)]
*  Big Africa, too. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3779.16s)]
*  It's just. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3781.16s)]
*  How many from Africa do you think? [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3783.16s)]
*  I don't have that on top of my head. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3784.16s)]
*  But special interests countries, numbers like we never seen before. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3786.16s)]
*  And we can't properly vet them. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3792.16s)]
*  That's one thing I'm going to scream about two years. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3794.16s)]
*  Secretary of the Minerals gets up there and say they're all properly vetted. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3795.16s)]
*  Vetted against what? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3798.16s)]
*  Because we don't have criminal data from El Salvador or Turkey or Syria. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3799.16s)]
*  Do you think China is going to give us any national security data on their people or Russia? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3802.16s)]
*  So you vet them against NCIC, which we have. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3807.16s)]
*  So unless you're convicted, unless you've been convicted or arrested in this country before, [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3810.16s)]
*  and your fingerprints were taken, you're going to come back clean because we don't have access to most countries criminal data. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3814.16s)]
*  A lot of these countries don't have criminal data, right? [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3819.16s)]
*  You think Haiti has an NCIC? Absolutely don't. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3822.16s)]
*  So they say they vet them and they don't vet them properly. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3824.16s)]
*  And when it comes to terrorist vetting, beyond the criminal vetting, how about terrorist vetting? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3827.16s)]
*  You and I both know most terrorists in this world aren't in any database. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3832.16s)]
*  Unless they were part of a T3 operation or caught on chatter or encountered on a battlefield by a soldier [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3836.16s)]
*  and biometrics were taken, we don't know who they are, where they're at. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3843.16s)]
*  And so even they say they vet them through these terrorist databases don't really mean a lot. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3848.16s)]
*  But here's one thing that hasn't been talked about a lot. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3853.16s)]
*  And I've talked to several whistleblowers in border control. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3856.16s)]
*  So they vet somebody from one of these countries, they vet them through the bureau. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3859.16s)]
*  But there's been such a push by this administration, process quick, release quick, because there's nowhere we're crawling. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3864.16s)]
*  There's nothing to see here. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3869.16s)]
*  The border is secure. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3870.16s)]
*  They process and release so quickly. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3871.16s)]
*  Sometimes the vetting came back after they release and they were hot. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3873.16s)]
*  At least two occasions this has happened. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3876.16s)]
*  ICE actually found one later on. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3878.16s)]
*  They're hot meaning what they've got. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3880.16s)]
*  They're a positive hit on the terrorist database, a person of interest. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3882.16s)]
*  So that's going to change. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3886.16s)]
*  I mean, we have to detain these people. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3889.16s)]
*  The Trump administration won't end catch and release. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3891.16s)]
*  Either you're going to be sent back to Mexico or we'll detain you. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3893.16s)]
*  The only thing that I'm concerned with is the Zabados Supreme Court ruling. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3896.16s)]
*  There's a ruling called Zabados versus U.S. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3902.16s)]
*  It says you can only hold somebody up to six months for a significant likelihood of removal. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3904.16s)]
*  So if we have a country that absolutely not take them back, at the end of six months we've got a decision to make. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3912.16s)]
*  Either we move into a cooperating third country or we have to release them unless we can prove... [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3917.16s)]
*  Why not send them to Mexico if they came through more than Mexico deal with it? [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3924.16s)]
*  That's part of the plan. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3927.16s)]
*  The Claudia lady deal with it. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3928.16s)]
*  That's part of the plan. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3929.16s)]
*  We're hoping to do that. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3930.16s)]
*  But the Zabados ruling is terrible and we're hoping that now we've got a better Supreme Court, that needs to be relitigated. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3931.16s)]
*  To say we can only hold somebody for six months and there's a significant public safety threat just because this country says no, we don't want them, there's got to be a better way. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3936.16s)]
*  I wonder if the 47,000 Chinese that you mentioned, that's kind of what Fidel Castro did in 1980 with the Mario boat lift, just like empty the prisons and the mental hospitals. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3947.16s)]
*  Why wouldn't they do that? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3958.16s)]
*  Well, Venezuela has. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3960.16s)]
*  Venezuela has? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3962.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3963.16s)]
*  But has China, do you think? [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3964.16s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3967.16s)]
*  I think China, these people came here for a purpose. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3968.16s)]
*  As you know, you've done a lot of reporting and they got land around military bases. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3972.16s)]
*  They're setting up a shadow business here. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3978.16s)]
*  I think China, between all these people they sent, plus continuing to create the precursors that make Fentanyl, they're trying to destroy this country. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3981.16s)]
*  That's my personal opinion. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3989.16s)]
*  Well, they're selling drugs all over the country. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3990.16s)]
*  They're selling drugs all over the state of Maine. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3991.16s)]
*  Maine. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3993.16s)]
*  Chinese nationals. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3994.16s)]
*  And what has the Biden administration done to China about creating these Fentanyls that they sold to cartels in Mexico? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=3996.16s)]
*  What have they done about the cartels? [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4001.16s)]
*  Nothing. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4003.16s)]
*  President Trump's going though. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4004.16s)]
*  No, because Fentanyls killed the exact Americans that Biden hates and is always attacking. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4005.16s)]
*  I mean, it's committed genocide against his enemies, so he doesn't seem against it at all. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4010.16s)]
*  It's all very dark. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4017.16s)]
*  You have to wonder, you said you used the phrase military-age males. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4018.16s)]
*  Because this was so coordinated by these NGOs, Catholic charities, UN and others, you have to kind of wonder, like, is there some military purpose to this invasion? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4023.16s)]
*  Have you wondered that? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4040.16s)]
*  I've wondered every day. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4041.16s)]
*  I can't wait to get in power and start drilling down on these files. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4043.16s)]
*  Who are these people who you released? [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4046.16s)]
*  What kind of vetting did you do? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4047.16s)]
*  Did you take biometric, biographic data? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4049.16s)]
*  Yeah, high testosterone foreigners? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4051.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4053.16s)]
*  I mean, why? [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4054.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to be paranoid, but. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4055.16s)]
*  But it's been very, you know, they don't talk about it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4057.16s)]
*  And it's very, you know, but when we get in power, we're going to have to pull all those records. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4061.16s)]
*  You know, like that's over 300,000 missing children. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4065.16s)]
*  We got to pull those records from HHS. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4068.16s)]
*  Okay, so what? [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4070.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4071.16s)]
*  I've been told by whistleblowers. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4072.16s)]
*  What is that? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4073.16s)]
*  300,000 missing children. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4074.16s)]
*  Anything else I've read reference to? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4075.16s)]
*  Well, over half a million children have been trafficking to this country. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4076.16s)]
*  And they get turned over to custody of HHS, officer refugee resettlement, who find sponsors and release them to sponsors. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4080.16s)]
*  I've talked to several whistleblowers, say they weren't even fingerprinting the sponsors on many occasions and not doing proper vetting. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4087.16s)]
*  We have a whistleblower who's testified in front of Congress now three times. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4093.16s)]
*  A lot of these children seem to be victims of trafficking. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4097.16s)]
*  We released unvetted sponsors and many children were we released to one sponsor. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4100.16s)]
*  The one was the blower said there was 11 young girls released in one male, single male. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4105.16s)]
*  Maybe it's all innocent. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4113.16s)]
*  Maybe it's not. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4114.16s)]
*  There's nothing innocent about that. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4115.16s)]
*  That's sick. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4116.16s)]
*  No. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4117.16s)]
*  And look, the CBP One app, they shut that down because of massive fraud. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4118.16s)]
*  One of the insiders in CBP told me, for example, one dead man sponsored over 1600 people and dead for years. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4121.16s)]
*  Massive fraud, massive trafficking. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4130.16s)]
*  And when they talk about opening CBP, one app to do that, I said at the time before they even implemented it, if you do this, it's going to create a huge trafficking network. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4132.16s)]
*  Or if you're from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela, you want to come to United States under this CHNV program, you just got to find a sponsor who will take care of you. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4141.16s)]
*  How many sick pedophiles would be willing to sponsor anybody from one of those four countries to come live in the United States? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4154.16s)]
*  They have to get here. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4159.16s)]
*  You own them. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4160.16s)]
*  All you got to do is you their official sponsor. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4162.16s)]
*  Without you, they can't stay. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4164.16s)]
*  And what are these sick sponsors, not all of them, but many of these are going to be predators and sick people, what are they going to do to these people who are trying to stay in this country? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4166.16s)]
*  It's a huge human trafficking issue. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4176.16s)]
*  I guarantee you. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4179.16s)]
*  And by human trafficking, is it mostly for prostitution? [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4180.16s)]
*  Prostitution or forced labor, mainly those two things. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4183.16s)]
*  So if you go to any construction site in the United States, big construction site, they're building a data center or a mall. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4186.16s)]
*  I know this because I know a guy who's in the business just told me this. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4192.16s)]
*  Anyone in the United States, there will be child prostitutes there from Latin America, brought in by the cartels for the guys on the cruise. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4197.16s)]
*  And I said, does everyone know this? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4206.16s)]
*  Everyone knows it. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4209.16s)]
*  I mean, it's a fact. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4210.16s)]
*  Every big construction site in the United States. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4211.16s)]
*  Does anyone ever do anything about it? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4213.16s)]
*  No. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4214.16s)]
*  No one ever does anything about it. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4215.16s)]
*  Wait until January 21st. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4216.16s)]
*  I don't understand that though. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4218.16s)]
*  If everyone in the building trades knows that, how can law enforcement ignore it? [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4219.16s)]
*  We're not going to starting June 21st. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4226.16s)]
*  Good. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4229.16s)]
*  But I can tell you, look, of the over 300,000 this government lost track of, I guarantee you, as I say here today, we'll find many in forced labor. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4230.16s)]
*  We'll find many in forced sex trafficking. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4242.16s)]
*  That's a sad thing. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4244.16s)]
*  We're going to find them. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4245.16s)]
*  So that's why President Trump's saying seriously, we got to save these women and children that are put in this position. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4246.16s)]
*  The immigration consequences will still come. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4251.16s)]
*  But first we got to save them, get these kids, as far as the kids, over 300,000. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4253.16s)]
*  We got to save these kids. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4257.16s)]
*  A lot of them are living the life of hell every day. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4258.16s)]
*  And I guarantee you, we're going to find, well, HSI has already found some of these children, meatpacking plants, cleaning up entrails on the midnight shift. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4260.16s)]
*  We're going to find some living with pedophiles. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4269.16s)]
*  We're going to find some are in sex slavery. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4272.16s)]
*  Some are going to be dead. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4274.16s)]
*  But we got to find these children. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4275.16s)]
*  And President Trump made that a third rail of priorities. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4277.16s)]
*  And it's something that needs to be done. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4280.16s)]
*  This administration stopped the DNA testing. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4282.16s)]
*  They stopped the proper vetting. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4285.16s)]
*  Under the Trump administration, we were having the same problem in the beginning. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4286.16s)]
*  We did DNA testing. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4290.16s)]
*  You weren't a family unless DNA testing showed you a family. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4291.16s)]
*  And we did vetting. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4294.16s)]
*  We didn't just vet the sponsor fully. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4295.16s)]
*  We vetted everybody in their household to make sure there wasn't a pedophile living in the house, make sure there wasn't someone arrested with domestic violence in the house. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4297.16s)]
*  This administration stopped all that because Becerra, the secretary of HHS, he gets on stage and brags. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4304.16s)]
*  I saw him on stage bragging how quick we released these kids from government custody. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4310.16s)]
*  We got a machine here. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4315.16s)]
*  It's like the Ford plant. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4317.16s)]
*  We get them in and out of here. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4319.16s)]
*  Yeah, because you stopped the proper vetting. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4321.16s)]
*  You stopped DNA testing. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4323.16s)]
*  And God help you for what you did to these children because a lot of these children are living in the life of hell every day. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4324.16s)]
*  So we got to find these kids. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4329.16s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4330.16s)]
*  So what last question I'm just interested in why you're doing this. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4332.16s)]
*  So you you did it for 40 years. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4337.16s)]
*  Yeah, 1984, 40 years. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4339.16s)]
*  And then you go into the private sector and you're not retired, but you get to do kind of what you want to do and make a real wage after working for the government all these years. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4342.16s)]
*  And this problem is just so enormous. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4352.16s)]
*  And the bureaucracy is so complex and hard to fight. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4356.16s)]
*  And they always win in the end. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4362.16s)]
*  Why would you take this job? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4364.16s)]
*  Well, because I love my country. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4366.16s)]
*  First of all, we made more progress on the southern board ever before. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4370.16s)]
*  The first of Trump ministries, I was ice director. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4375.16s)]
*  I'm taking an 82 percent pay cut. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4378.16s)]
*  Oh, I bet. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4383.16s)]
*  And I'm going back to cover paycheck. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4384.16s)]
*  And thank God my wife supports me. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4386.16s)]
*  She said I don't take the job. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4388.16s)]
*  She's going to divorce me because she wants to keep me waking up every day, mad at the world. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4390.16s)]
*  I didn't come back. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4394.16s)]
*  Your wife's not a liberal. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4395.16s)]
*  No, she's not. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4397.16s)]
*  You know, I say this many times because of things I've seen in my career. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4403.16s)]
*  I mean, I stood in the back with Tractor Trailer. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4406.16s)]
*  I grew up in a town of 2500 people, either your milk cows or your logger or you worked at Fort Drum. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4408.16s)]
*  So many three things you did where I grew up. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4415.16s)]
*  So I grew up in a town of 2500. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4419.16s)]
*  I fast forward. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4421.16s)]
*  I'm sitting in the back. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4422.16s)]
*  I'm standing in the back of the trailer, Tractor Trailer, 19 dead people at my feet that baked to death and back to Tractor Trailer, including a five year old little boy who suffocated death. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4423.16s)]
*  And on top of it was his father who was trying to protect him. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4433.16s)]
*  During that investigation, they said that old boy begged his father not to let him die because he wanted to see his mom again. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4436.16s)]
*  Begged over and over again. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4444.16s)]
*  Here's a five year old boy who knew he was dying and asked his dad for help. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4446.16s)]
*  His dad can't help him, right? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4453.16s)]
*  No. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4455.16s)]
*  I've talked to little girls as young as nine or eight multiple times. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4456.16s)]
*  I remember to the cartel not once numerous times grown men crawled upon this little girl, took everything innocent and pure from her. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4460.16s)]
*  Her life would never be the same. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4468.16s)]
*  Look in her eyes. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4470.16s)]
*  There wasn't life in her eyes. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4471.16s)]
*  It's just a little girl's devastated for life. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4473.16s)]
*  And this happens every day when they unsecured the border on purpose. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4476.16s)]
*  I wrote an op-ed at Fox News and I says, if Joe Biden wins the presidency, we lose the border. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4482.16s)]
*  When you lose the border, trafficking of sex trafficking will skyrocket. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4487.16s)]
*  Child deaths will skyrocket. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4491.16s)]
*  Migrant deaths will skyrocket. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4493.16s)]
*  American deaths will skyrocket from drugs coming across that border. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4495.16s)]
*  I wake up really pissed off for four years. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4499.16s)]
*  So I've been on numerous networks complaining about it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4501.16s)]
*  So when President Trump calls me up, says, you've been complaining about for four years. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4505.16s)]
*  You want to come fix it? [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4511.16s)]
*  How do you say no? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4513.16s)]
*  First of all, you don't say no to President of the United States. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4514.16s)]
*  And second of all, I won't say no to secure. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4516.16s)]
*  I love this country. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4520.16s)]
*  I want to save some lives, secure borders, save lives. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4521.16s)]
*  I'm going to come back, do what I can. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4523.16s)]
*  I guarantee you what we're going to do is going to save migrant lives. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4525.16s)]
*  It's going to save American lives. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4528.16s)]
*  It's going to protect our national security. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4530.16s)]
*  That's why I'm coming back. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4532.16s)]
*  Not for the pay. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4534.16s)]
*  I tell you that. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4535.16s)]
*  I'm coming back because after three and a half decades doing this job, do you understand it? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4536.16s)]
*  Do you understand the tragedies that happen around it? [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4542.16s)]
*  The more secure that border is, the more lives we save. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4544.16s)]
*  So I can rest. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4547.16s)]
*  When I retire for the third time, I can say, I did my part to save some lives. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4549.16s)]
*  And maybe less children are being exploited and women are being exploited by these cartels. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4554.16s)]
*  And my number one goal is seeing these cartels wipe out the face of the earth. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4557.16s)]
*  I think President Trump's the guy to do it. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4563.16s)]
*  Of everyone appointed, I think you got the best shot at winning because you know exactly what you want to do. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4565.16s)]
*  No, Tom, thank you very much. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4570.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. Thank you. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4572.16s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4574.16s)]
*  I know. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4578.16s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake, Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4579.16s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4585.16s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4588.16s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4590.16s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4591.16s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4593.16s)]
*  I'm not in charge of Google. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4594.16s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4595.16s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4601.16s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4603.16s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance of getting a lot of information. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4607.16s)]
*  And we hope you will. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDTEh4apCbw&t=4613.16s)]
