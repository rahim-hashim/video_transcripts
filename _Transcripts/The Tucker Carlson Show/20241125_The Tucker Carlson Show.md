**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4)
*  Yeah, I was on the five I remember now I was on over what they call it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=0.0s)]
*  What's the ones of women and oh? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5.04s)]
*  outnumbered and I was up there they used to bring me up to all the time because that guy's just so popular with our viewers it [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=7.76s)]
*  Was popular yeah, and the girls the girls on that show they were laughing and they said oh, that's good [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=14.6s)]
*  Donald Trump's you know says he's running for president all that and [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=20.36s)]
*  And they're laughing and they're kind of you know making like it's a joke [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=24.72s)]
*  Okay, they said [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=28.3s)]
*  What say you Willie and I said tell you what I think he's resonate with a lot of people and you can just see [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=30.060000000000002s)]
*  I'm like set like oh [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=35.14s)]
*  like they thought I was gonna laugh and be joking I [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=37.14s)]
*  Said don't underestimate the power of celebrity because I was like I'm just new to it [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=40.46s)]
*  but man when everybody knows who you are that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  it's a big advantage because [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=47.94s)]
*  You think about Kamala Harris. She was a vice president for three and a half years. No one knew how to say her name [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=50.86s)]
*  Including her and she was the vice president [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=55.74s)]
*  When they got elected or whatever it was in 2020 I [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=79.66s)]
*  I totally by accident I pronounced I called her Kamala. Yeah, which is what I thought her name was and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=83.78s)]
*  The White House press secretary attacked me as racist [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=90.7s)]
*  Which okay fine, but it really was I would have been totally accidental right and so this kid on our staff found tape [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=94.82000000000001s)]
*  of her calling herself Kamala and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=102.7s)]
*  then Kamala [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=105.5s)]
*  And I just thought like who can't pronounce her own first name [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=107.26s)]
*  Yeah, that's if you're like, I'm Willie Robertson, I'm Will A Robertson [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=111.16s)]
*  Hello, I'm Wiley Robertson, I think it's fair to like settle on a pronunciation of your own [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  So one of the things um, I was I've never hunted with you before [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=125.8s)]
*  You've become famous for bird hunting. You're an excellent shot. I just want to confirm that for people watching. It's not fake [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=130.28s)]
*  I've got to make my dad and brothers watch this. It's true. No, they know it's true. You are [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=137.68s)]
*  But you're not [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=143.96s)]
*  You become famous from television. You've I just want to get right to it. You've written this book [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=145.64000000000001s)]
*  Gospelar [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=152.32s)]
*  Which is not about hunting. It's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=153.96s)]
*  Kind of what's it about hunting for people? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=156.76000000000002s)]
*  Hunting fishing for people perhaps turning turning darkness into light one conversation at a time. Yeah, that's [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  Come with this book this year and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  This was kind of the one I wanted to write, you know, it's like before I die [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  I want to write this book and it's really about my faith [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=172.48000000000002s)]
*  The faith that was passed down the first chapters [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=176.4s)]
*  my mom and dad's story about how they [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=179.84s)]
*  Got their faith. We put out a movie last year called the blind [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  Which was their journey and faith [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=186.88s)]
*  Shot in the late 60s [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  70s and that was a bad he was a bad guy and in what way oh, he's just [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=192.72s)]
*  Well, he called himself a heathen. He was just a bad dude, you know just into [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=199.64s)]
*  Everything he shouldn't have been into he's married. He's got this young family [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=204.68s)]
*  He's drunk all the time. He loses his job. He's ends up running a bar and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=209.72s)]
*  All hope literally was over. He had kicked us out of the home. He's a bad dad. He's a bad husband [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=215.48s)]
*  When he kicked you out of the home, he kicked mom and us out of the house. He's or out the trailer really? Yeah, and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=222.64s)]
*  Yeah, and so and the one person who didn't give up on him was my aunt Jan his younger sister and she [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=230.64s)]
*  Should go up to this bar. He was running that has like a master's degree. He was a [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  Could have went professional [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=244.12s)]
*  Quarterback he played ahead of Bradshaw and in college at Louisiana Tech gifted athlete had everything [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=246.6s)]
*  You know ahead of him and just pretty much throws it all away [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=253.04s)]
*  and so my my my aunt would go up there and pass out a little Bible track she was a [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=255.76s)]
*  very charismatic Christian and and he hated it, you know, he was like stay out of here and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=262.08s)]
*  and she begged this preacher to go preach the gospel to her brother and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=268.04s)]
*  And I write in the book I can just imagine this conversation like because because the preachers in Louisiana the bars in Arkansas and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=273.84s)]
*  I'm sure was like can you share the gospel with my brother? He's wayward and and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=282.04s)]
*  He probably was like, yeah, tell him to come to church. We'll meet after so he's not coming to church and you have to go [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=287.2s)]
*  See him. What does he do? He runs a bar in Arkansas. Yeah, which one in town? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=292.88s)]
*  Even in the state, you know and this guy gets in his car and drives to a bar walks in [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  Where was the bar with his Bible? It was in Junction City, Arkansas [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=303.4s)]
*  And it was rough, you know, it's a ride [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=308.32s)]
*  And it was adversarial like the guy goes in Phil does not want to hear he does not he's not even invited in there and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=312.28s)]
*  And I knew the preacher up until he passed away and and he and he he says [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  Since your dad your dad's sitting there [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=325.16s)]
*  He said he's got a pistol in his belt and a giant Budweiser and he's about half lit [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  And the dad looks at him says what you selling preacher man? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  And the guy sits down and nothing happens Phil doesn't listen that there's no conversion. There's no just as I am [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=335.96000000000004s)]
*  Bar baptism they'll just said I'll keep that mine and so he leaves and then and Phil's life even goes more in the tank [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  He ends up [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  The state police showed up to arrest him. He goes and lives in the woods for six months [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=353.28s)]
*  I think like he was that guy. What were they arresting him for? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=358.32s)]
*  He had put two people in ICU beat him up over a bar dispute [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=362.08s)]
*  He just takes all [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  lives in the woods [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=369.32s)]
*  Come on mom and out there is when he he [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=371.47999999999996s)]
*  He got really sick and nobody, you know [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=375.79999999999995s)]
*  Everybody was trying to figure out where he was and but he was got her wife and kids at this point [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=377.84s)]
*  well, then they let mom end up moving to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=381.84s)]
*  They moved to Louisiana and was pretty much like [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=384.52s)]
*  hope he doesn't die, you know, but it's over, you know, he's already kicked us out and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=387.59999999999997s)]
*  And then he comes dragging back up into that town and he pulls up to where my mom was working [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=392.67999999999995s)]
*  she has a new job and trying to move on with her life and and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=398.64s)]
*  She's like call the police like oh no. He's you know, he's a [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=402.12s)]
*  living in the woods [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  He pulls up he's crying he said where's that preacher I need talk to him and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=409.8s)]
*  That's when Phil became a believer right there. So that's the first chapter in the book [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=414.24s)]
*  So how long did it take your mom to take him back into she took him right back? It was amazing [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, I always said if it weren't for dad [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=425.48s)]
*  Changing his life, but also if it wasn't for mom forgiving him and yeah [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=428.08s)]
*  It's easier to change your life than to give someone who's a bandit. Especially when you're just saying it. Yeah [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=432.36s)]
*  And who knows, you know, I'm sure there probably wasn't the counseling that we had, you know, yeah [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=437.4s)]
*  No, you know, she but she needed help. I mean she's got three young boys and at the time three and I was the youngest at [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=443.44s)]
*  the time [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  So in the movie I'm portrayed. I was very particular who played me in the movie at two years old [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=451.08s)]
*  I mean you gotta get that part, right? Oh, yeah, that's gonna be a handsome toddler [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=456.23999999999995s)]
*  It was my grandson played me my grandson played me about his great-grandfather [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=459.84s)]
*  It was awesome. That's fine. It's fun to watch that movie and [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=466.36s)]
*  It's a hard movie to watch and dad didn't want to do it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=470.12s)]
*  He it was tough for him to go back, you know and relive that, you know, just pull all those [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  But we said dad and mom to both we just said I think this can help a lot of people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=479.36s)]
*  you know a lot of people who were in similar situations and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=485.2s)]
*  So, yeah, they stayed together and so the first chapter of the book is that and and so if you think about like this [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=488.96s)]
*  Like 50 years ago that happened if that doesn't happen this family does not stay together [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=494.44s)]
*  If the family doesn't stay together, there's no duck commander. There's no duck commander. There's no duck. Honestly, there's no [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=500.24s)]
*  Podcast I don't know where I would be my whole life would look completely different [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=506.96s)]
*  And so part of the reason for us being [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=511.8s)]
*  Still so excited about our faith is because we feel like we owe everything we have to our had it not been for faith [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=515.36s)]
*  It would have been over, you know marriage was over. Yeah, who knows? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=520.96s)]
*  So do you I mean do you remember a time before your father was down? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=524.76s)]
*  Do your brothers they do they do I don't really [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=528.76s)]
*  Everything I remember was was great and and he went from [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=533.04s)]
*  you know [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=537.88s)]
*  Darkness to light. I mean he literally it's kind of like [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=539.64s)]
*  Saw and paw in the Bible, you know, it's like this old person then he just turned and just went I mean just [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=542.72s)]

*  Kind of how to do that because a lot of people they're so intimidated [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=799.46s)]
*  They don't know what to say and they like the idea of it and they're like [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=802.82s)]
*  I hope somebody tells somebody about their faith or about Jesus, but it ain't me and I don't know how to do that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=806.02s)]
*  I don't it's like I don't know where to start [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=812.4s)]
*  I don't know the Bible enough and so we kind of just qualify ourselves from a lot of those [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=814.4s)]
*  for a lot of those reasons and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=819.3199999999999s)]
*  So I just tried to go through and tell stories now pull stories from the New Testament just conversations like especially conversations [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=822.1999999999999s)]
*  Like especially in the book of Acts like that's where you're really seeing [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=828.72s)]
*  Kind of the church meet with the world and just pull the conversations like this what they said [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=831.9599999999999s)]
*  Then this is how you could share with others so you your family despite living in a very rural area [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=836.8399999999999s)]
*  You've got a duck call business and you're serious a Christian. Mm-hmm. You wind up in television [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=843.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, which is like the opposite of all of that. Yeah, so how do you have the so the crew comes in for wherever? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=849.5999999999999s)]
*  You're meeting with the studio executives from wherever but not from West Monroe, Louisiana [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=855.8s)]
*  No, how do you begin a conversation about your faith with something like that? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=860.92s)]
*  Well, it was obvious [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=865.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=867.1999999999999s)]
*  I think the face just comes through in every it was gonna be hard to separate that separate the faith and so but I understood [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=867.48s)]
*  Television enough to know that you know, it can't just be a sermon, you know, it's got a you know, right and we live [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=874.24s)]
*  People who run television I have noticed from spending a lifetime. They're not super receptive to the message [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=880.76s)]
*  they weren't as you know, a lot of people ask me that like we ended every show with a prayer and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=888.0799999999999s)]
*  And I get that I'm gonna skip this like [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=894.8s)]
*  Weekly, it's like I bet they didn't want that prayer and but that wasn't the case. They they're like school [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=898.28s)]
*  You know like good for them. Yeah, it wasn't a [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=903.92s)]
*  Wasn't a battle at all. It's just a good way to end the show. They knew faith was important to us and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=906.64s)]
*  And that's how they what that's how we ended every show was with that prayer, but there wasn't a lot of [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=911.56s)]
*  resistance [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=918.0s)]
*  At all from that so you're but I know I think people they thought that was the case or wanted to know I love maybe [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=920.0s)]
*  Yeah, and it really wasn't it was like and then once it works and once it's right the [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=925.88s)]
*  Biggest show, you know ever in reality TV. There's like oh, we love that prayer. Yeah, that was our idea [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=931.88s)]
*  No, no [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=938.08s)]
*  You know it it it worked [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=939.84s)]
*  And so once we talked about how to do it and my father was he was so funny with the show [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=941.72s)]
*  So when I went down to tell him I said dad we you know [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=946.44s)]
*  I get this idea doing this television show and he hated it. He's like I don't want to do it, you know and [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=949.44s)]
*  So well the idea come from I said it's a way to get the gospel out to more people and literally that's what I told [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=955.36s)]
*  him [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=961.1600000000001s)]
*  He says in a sharing us. Hmm. I never thought about that. He goes you think it can I said I don't see why not [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=962.0400000000001s)]
*  He gives a thumbs up and he's like, all right [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=967.6400000000001s)]
*  We'll do the TV show if he can get the gospel out to more people [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=969.84s)]
*  So you do a show like that what are the mechanics of it because it seems like it would take over your life completely [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=972.48s)]
*  It does so like how does it work? It's a lot of well, we didn't know when we started like we had no idea [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=977.6s)]
*  I get a I get an email [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=983.9200000000001s)]
*  this is so we had done another television show on the outdoor channel and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=987.96s)]
*  in the same way like [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=994.12s)]

*  Well, yeah, I think I think your family needs to have a reality TV show and I'm like, that's not a compliment [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1011.4s)]
*  well when your wife says your family needs a reality TV show that's [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1017.08s)]

*  But the other half was just like silly reality stuff that we just came up and I kind of focused on that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1680.5800000000002s)]
*  My brother and dad and then they did the hardcore hunting and then I was over there doing that [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1686.5s)]
*  hey, we can show this and we can just wild crazy stuff we were doing and and the show was super popular like in that world [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1690.0200000000002s)]
*  everybody loved it and [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1697.5400000000002s)]
*  we won awards and [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1699.14s)]
*  Our sales went up more people around duck calls and our t-shirts so it was like hey we did it man and [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1701.66s)]
*  I had to sell the part of the deal was I had to sell half the advertisers [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1707.18s)]
*  So because then that that when you get your commercial then you have to go sell them [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1712.68s)]
*  So but now he was so happy and I sold half of them and it was so funny [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1716.6200000000001s)]
*  Like it was hard selling but ultimately was gonna be Doug Dostoe. It was you know [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1721.38s)]
*  It's hard selling an ad for this thing. I ended up selling all mine [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1724.8200000000002s)]
*  I would sell my ads and that was part of the deal I had to do [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1728.5s)]

*  You will not be able to walk down the street without people everybody recognizing who you are [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1797.54s)]
*  Like he had landed on pick, you know [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1803.26s)]
*  And so I said so what do we need to do if we were to do that? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1806.3s)]
*  He said we'll make a sizzle reel and of course and we had [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1810.6599999999999s)]
*  Just done like three seasons of this show [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1813.62s)]
*  so we took three minutes and then he started pitching around the networks and [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1816.02s)]
*  There was a lot of interest you got to remember this is the time Louisiana the tax credits were big like before Georgia [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1820.6999999999998s)]
*  Adam Louisiana was kind of hotbed and there was tons of shows. I mean our state is like there's so much culture and just [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1827.54s)]
*  fun people in our state anyway, and so you had [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1835.6599999999999s)]
*  Billy the exterminator swamp [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1839.26s)]
*  Swamp people [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1842.42s)]

*  So if you had anything in Louisiana because they knew they could go say 40% [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1848.9s)]
*  you know in this state and [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1852.98s)]
*  He saw it and we were on the outdoor channel [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1854.98s)]
*  He saw it and then I'd know where it comes A&E A&E. I didn't really know anything about A&E. I didn't watch [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1857.74s)]
*  even know what it was and [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1864.1000000000001s)]
*  He said A&E is interested in two pilots [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1866.5800000000002s)]
*  And I'm like, what does that mean? He says well [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1869.9s)]
*  If they pick it up, that's where we want to be. It's a good mixed audience like men and women watch A&E [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1872.98s)]
*  big company, you know, it's you know combined with History Channel ABC Disney all this and [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1879.7800000000002s)]
*  ESPN and so he said the problem is if they pass on his dad like because then everybody say oh they passed [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1886.46s)]
*  Yeah, and so we shot two pilots for A&E had no idea what we were doing and then the film crew got giant [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1893.1s)]
*  you know, they sent down this huge crew and and we had no idea we just kind of [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1900.62s)]
*  Went into it not really know what we were doing [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1905.8999999999999s)]
*  So what's it didn't know if it was good or not didn't know, you know [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1907.8999999999999s)]
*  And and so what was interesting was they didn't know they didn't know what exactly they were getting [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1911.02s)]
*  so if you if you kind of looked at a [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1917.1399999999999s)]
*  Picture of us you'd be like, I think they thought we like grunted and like [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1919.3000000000002s)]
*  you know and [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1924.6200000000001s)]
*  English so they didn't that they they thought it's gonna be like danger like [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1928.8200000000002s)]
*  Alligators are coming out of the water, you know [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1933.8600000000001s)]
*  So they come down and so hey, so we shot the bias we sent it off and so they call him [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1935.9s)]
*  We're like well, we have good news and bad news [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1940.5800000000002s)]
*  The the bad news is this is not the show we were ordering like at all [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1942.66s)]
*  We were all shocked and we're like, oh they said the good news is it's way better than what we thought we were getting [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1947.02s)]
*  And they were like this is a family show because nobody had put us in any category of family show [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1953.8600000000001s)]
*  even though we were family, but it was like they just didn't I [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1960.78s)]
*  Think they thought kind of like we're gonna laugh at these but you know, these are they just totally didn't it was a honey [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1963.5800000000002s)]
*  Boo-boo thing they say right they didn't realize right that [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1969.1000000000001s)]
*  because some of their ideas [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1972.66s)]
*  Initially something it was like the women folk are out, you know getting the possums, you know skinning them out [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1975.5400000000002s)]
*  These women folk do not we don't even go [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1984.3000000000002s)]
*  But they saw and then there was this comedy this real because the first show we did an outdoor channel wasn't really funny and [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1989.8600000000001s)]
*  Once we saw this kind of comedic thing come out. That's what I mean that was what really I think set it apart was [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=1997.22s)]
*  It's funny. It's a fun, you know, something gonna laugh, you know, it's a funny show. What's the I mean, what's the process of filming it? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2003.34s)]
*  Well [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2013.1s)]
*  You said you get your house got descended on by a swarm of producers. It was yeah, so we we shot in [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2014.42s)]
*  all our houses, especially mine [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2021.58s)]
*  Especially my mouse was kind of them [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2025.22s)]
*  Because the show was kind of we didn't know any of this going in because we didn't know what we were doing [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2027.58s)]
*  But it was kind of shot through my eyes. And so you would have like Willie's dad [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2032.1s)]
*  Willie's wife so you're watching that as a viewer you're watching it through my eyes [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2038.02s)]
*  So I was supposed to be the normal guy. I'm the normal person and then everybody else is is crazy [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2041.86s)]
*  You know this chaos is happening and they to some extent they are crazy [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2046.86s)]
*  And so see had some people they're just kind of like themselves like like my father just net he that never understood [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2050.9s)]
*  What exactly we were doing like he never understood the show he never liked it he never understood he he told me early on he was [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2057.6600000000003s)]
*  Like well tell him we need more preaching on the show [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2065.42s)]
*  I said dad, there's another Robertson family with a show like that. It's the 700 [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2069.02s)]
*  We're not that show like this is this is not that are you related to them, but he was like [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2074.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm not no, I'm not not that uh, they haven't asked me for money. So I guess I'm not [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2080.62s)]
*  Everybody related to me. It's asking for money [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2085.98s)]
*  So, yeah, he never quite understood the show he [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2091.98s)]
*  So my dad got this one. So my dad got so mad one time he [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2096.34s)]
*  said he was saying they just didn't understand so goofy and we were just being stupid and [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2099.82s)]
*  So he said now this is my favorite thing that ever happened to agnostic that never got shown [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2105.5s)]
*  So we had this dinner scene every time you know, yeah, and so we're on like episode 80, you know [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2110.74s)]

*  You don't look right. Yeah, it's just it's kind of weird when you become a CEO of your company and do all this now [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2124.18s)]
*  You're you know, you're listening to people you don't know and they're telling me what to do [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2130.18s)]
*  And so I think my dad had gotten well past the point of that at this point [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2133.8599999999997s)]

*  Then we go I I think I ate two pounds of meatloaf at least. Yeah, I said at least I okay you did [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2240.2s)]
*  I didn't look at your plate a lot and I thought that's not a good recipe for [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2248.3599999999997s)]
*  Not in for the afternoon [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2256.7999999999997s)]
*  Part of my demands though because I've heard recently about people in their podcasts and demands and what contract writers [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2261.56s)]
*  Yeah, and I said I demand we have to fly to another state [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2267.72s)]
*  Shoot birds that morning. Yes, there should be every this should be every podcast [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2272.6s)]
*  It was literally in the contract that you signed with us. You demanded lemon squares after I thought that's a bit [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2277.4s)]
*  That's a little much. Yeah, I said just go we have to go find somewhere to actually this was your idea [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2283.56s)]
*  And so thank you my idea. I was gonna go to Maine [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2288.6400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't have any pheasants in Maine. No, this was a better [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2293.6s)]
*  This is a way this was a way better idea if you could I don't know how many birds are shot this morning [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2296.84s)]
*  But if you can shoot two grouse a day in Maine, you're the best grouse on her in Maine [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2301.76s)]
*  Really you're a good shot too [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2305.64s)]
*  I'm telling your I would hope so. I'm telling you [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2308.12s)]
*  I'm not half. I wasn't surprised me. I knew you hung out a lot [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2312.16s)]
*  I'm not half as good as I should be after all the practice I've had I'll tell you that [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2315.4s)]
*  But no, it's actually I I missed a bird [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2319.56s)]
*  Bird got too aggressive with me and it intimidated me and I always think you know when you're bird hunting you're the pursuer [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2322.68s)]
*  You're the aggressor. You're the predator bird turns it around and tries to fly up your nose [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2329.96s)]
*  I just I freeze and miss the bird every time and you had to go, you know, it's unnatural. I was here a month ago [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2334.52s)]
*  Doing this pheasant hunting. I didn't grow up pheasant hunting. So we were poor. I [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2341.92s)]
*  Have a pheasant come he literally is coming at my face. Yeah, and I did know what to do and [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2348.28s)]
*  I I took the shot gun and I went back like I was gonna hit it like a baseball bat [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  and I own and I [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2360.4s)]
*  If I had a little more cojones, I wouldn't couldn't the God said you should have done it, you know [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2362.6s)]
*  I was that close. It was that close. He had I think he'd been hit so he was he's coming down [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2366.86s)]
*  He's like he was just so close and I there's a picture and you see me like this [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2372.14s)]
*  But any just go sure right and then I thought why didn't I? [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2377.4s)]
*  Can you imagine if you just grab presence of mine? [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2381.88s)]
*  That's what separates the yeah most out to that one [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2385.56s)]
*  The just grab that sucker out of the air would have been sets an Aaron Rodgers move and I blew it and I one day [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2389.56s)]
*  I'm gonna now I'm gonna schedule it like I was months of pheasant hunting [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2397.12s)]
*  Do I can get that same scenario to happen? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2400.88s)]
*  You know, I watched my father get hit right in the chest on a driven peg shoot for pheasant when I was a kid [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2403.0s)]
*  And it knocked him right down. He was turning talking to someone the pheasant just came in hit him right just bam [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2407.6s)]
*  He's a big man [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2411.98s)]

*  But now anyone who knows what's going on thinks that because it's true [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2423.96s)]

*  There were a lot of reasons I think [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2870.26s)]
*  When it gets more expensive it just keeps getting more expensive, you know, everything goes up, you know, it's like [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2874.3s)]

*  I'm assuming I mean, I think it's probably like a baseball player like you're paying a guy [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2893.1800000000003s)]

*  25 home runs [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2901.02s)]
*  We could pay a guy five or a thousand. Maybe he'll hit maybe we had 12 home runs [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2902.54s)]
*  I'm good enough. We'll save them. Yeah, and so I'm sure they're like we could make other shows [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2906.7400000000002s)]
*  And some of it just played out. I mean like [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=2911.1800000000003s)]

*  Man, there was it was [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4501.5s)]
*  People did not like him in 20. Oh my gosh, but you had that coded them in the whole coded and I said that year probably [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4503.82s)]
*  My earlier that year somebody asked me who I thought was gonna miss out Trump. I said Trump's got this [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4510.82s)]
*  There's no way he can lose the economy strong. We're safe or not a war. I said that that's it. That's game over [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4515.9s)]
*  I said unless something really weird happens [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4521.7s)]
*  I said that like they manufacture a virus in China and then the weird thing happened and there you go and [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4523.54s)]
*  But I went to bed last time thinking I went to bed in 20 thank you to yeah, I was like I was over [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4530.1s)]
*  Was she fell asleep before they? [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4537.06s)]
*  the polling places [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4539.860000000001s)]
*  So here's a question you shouldn't have to think about but probably do what would you do if your family needed [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4543.18s)]
*  Life-saving medication and you couldn't get any [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4550.26s)]
*  You hate to think you're gonna face that we depend on our supply chains all the way from Asia to here [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4553.9800000000005s)]
*  thousands of miles across the Pacific Ocean [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4559.38s)]
*  But let's be honest that chain is fragile [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4561.66s)]
*  Just one weather event one container ship accident an unexpected crisis a war on the brink of a couple and [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4564.38s)]
*  Suddenly you can't get the medication that you need that your family needs now people gonna tell you don't worry about it. Calm down [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4570.38s)]
*  Everything is fine. All right [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4576.7s)]
*  But why not spend a little bit of money to make sure everything actually will be fine? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4579.7s)]
*  And that's where the Jake Jase case comes in J a s e case [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4583.96s)]
*  It's not paranoid. It's planning the Jase case is a simple portable supply of emergency [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4589.34s)]
*  Medications ones you actually will need you can keep at home. So you're totally prepared [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4594.860000000001s)]
*  It's better to be too early than too late at this point [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4599.78s)]
*  Nobody thinks we're gonna be too early with this check it out for yourself [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4602.66s)]
*  Go to Jase calm J a s e calm and use the code Tucker for a discount. That's Jase calm promo code Tucker [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4605.1s)]

*  All of [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4623.1s)]
*  We've all got questions, but I don't understand what it is like I [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4627.860000000001s)]
*  Was like I've listened to people over time. There's tons of people who question that stuff always they quit, you know, like, yeah [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4632.02s)]
*  You know, they question like was it done, right? Was it you know, I mean I [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4640.22s)]
*  Didn't realize it was a crime to question [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4645.54s)]
*  Just to make sure that hey did everything I'll do that right because it seems strange, you know [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4648.58s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't but it was strange. Yeah. Yeah, I think the people in Louisiana are all like [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4655.42s)]
*  You know, yeah, it was pretty a few cities were waiting though. Well, let's you know tomorrow how much we behind [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4663.0199999999995s)]

*  2024 [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4686.02s)]
*  Yeah, lots happen [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4687.5s)]
*  The cast has grown up [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4689.5s)]
*  And then everybody else is still around and so yeah, so [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4692.54s)]
*  Back with A&E we met and they said hey you guys I shouldn't you know [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4697.42s)]
*  Kind of redoing a show and [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4703.38s)]
*  Felt like the time was right member the family prayed about was like I think so the kids were excited and said yeah [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4705.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's show you know [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4710.7s)]
*  We realized Tucker what? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4712.7s)]
*  You know, we talked about it's a long show and it's like it's hard work whatever, you know, I mean, it's a lot [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4715.42s)]
*  But man when you talk to people and they tell you like how much that meant to them and how much I can't tell you [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4721.54s)]
*  how many people just [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4727.9800000000005s)]
*  Like it was what my dad and I watched together. Yeah, my mom passed away [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4729.98s)]
*  It was like the last you know, it's the only thing that we could laugh at together and we watched as a family and I have like [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4734.099999999999s)]
*  25 year olds even here. I mean these kids are like, you know when I was eight [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4739.82s)]
*  I watched every show you had and was just you know watching the prayer at the end [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4743.5s)]
*  just watching our family be positive with our [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4747.339999999999s)]
*  You know, the roles were correct and it wasn't a lot of [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4751.0199999999995s)]
*  You know just darkness and stuff that people watch and it wasn't just a show [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4754.9s)]
*  Watch and it wasn't just a train wreck. And so it's really inspiring. You're like, oh man, you know, it's good to make something [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4758.86s)]
*  Especially when it came out originally, you know, it was a pretty much a little bright light amongst a lot of you know [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4766.46s)]
*  some dark stuff out there some dark TV, so [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4773.219999999999s)]
*  So I think when you can do that and you can provide that for people [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4776.54s)]
*  there's no pressure at all from [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4780.139999999999s)]
*  Your corporate masters to change anything or make it [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4783.179999999999s)]
*  No, I mean I actually I mean to be honest with you I feel stronger now than I would then because they know who we are [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4786.9400000000005s)]
*  You know, yeah, I mean they know we're all about it's not like I mean back then they didn't know they were like [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4792.82s)]
*  I think they're religious. I think you know, yeah, but now [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4797.74s)]
*  Obviously over the past. Well crap since 2000, you know last 12 years, you know where we stand [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4801.46s)]
*  you know what we're what our morals are, you know, what's important to us and [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4807.42s)]
*  And we have a lot of followers [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4811.82s)]
*  I'm saying like we have social media for Sadie has millions of people, you know, my kids have followers [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4813.42s)]
*  they you know, so a lot of people are interested in that and it's it's they're interested in I [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4818.38s)]
*  Think they want to be entertained, but they also [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4823.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, I think they learn stuff. I think they can watch and learn, you know [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4826.900000000001s)]
*  A lot of people that watched our show were like well, we never prayed like we never prayed before a meal [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4830.5s)]
*  We didn't even know, you know, and we started trying that you know, probably more often than not even the prayer [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4836.0s)]
*  They rarely ever sat down and even ate together anymore. That's a gone. That's the saddest thing [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4842.78s)]
*  They were like we never even we never even have dinner [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4848.3s)]
*  Everybody's just grabbing it and going, you know, meet you there meet you at the deal go to the ballpark [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4851.14s)]
*  You know, and so this whole idea of just sitting down and just spending time with each other dinner was [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4855.54s)]
*  Becoming a foreign concept and so I think people can learn and they can be like, oh, that's you know [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4862.3s)]
*  Maybe they can't they don't have the family we do [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4868.38s)]
*  Maybe they don't have maybe everybody doesn't live there like that [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4870.86s)]
*  But they can kind of live through that and kind of you know, start their own, you know [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4873.9s)]
*  Traditions are doing something more as a family realizing, you know the importance of it and [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4878.54s)]
*  And then also just taking a break and not you know, I think what I love about the guys was we didn't take ourselves too [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4883.9s)]
*  Seriously, we had fun. We laughed and oh god. I mean do we need that? I mean, we need yeah need some [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4889.5s)]
*  I think if you had written this book ten years ago, it would have seemed pretty weird, you know, why is the reality? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4895.82s)]
*  TV show writing a book about spreading the gospel right does not seem weird now. Do you think the country's changed? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4903.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it's changing. Yeah, I think it's I think it's certainly changing. I think people are looking for answers [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4912.78s)]
*  That's why I wrote the book. I think [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4917.74s)]
*  I think we get so lethargic and and some of this was even like even in churches they get they just get lethargic and they get off [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4920.38s)]
*  You know, you got to know what your goal is and what kind of what you're here for and what's your mission? [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4927.0199999999995s)]
*  You know what's your mission in life? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4932.7s)]
*  Well, and I take my mission from [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4935.0199999999995s)]
*  Matthew 28, which is the [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4937.5s)]
*  Labeled as the Great Commission and Jesus says go out and make disciples of all nations baptize people teach people three things [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4940.0599999999995s)]
*  Three specific ideas make disciples [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4947.18s)]
*  Baptize people teach people so those are the last things he said before he left like make sure you do this [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4951.34s)]
*  So when that's your mission [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4956.780000000001s)]
*  You just think about what you've got to do to accomplish those three things [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4959.9800000000005s)]
*  You probably have to have conversations with people [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4963.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, if you're going to make a disciple out of them if you're going to baptize them if you're going to teach them [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4965.820000000001s)]
*  You're going to have to have some sort of conversation [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4969.42s)]
*  And so what I find is people if your mission in life is to make disciples [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4971.9800000000005s)]
*  What I find is people if your mission in life is as a as a christian if you're like [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4975.34s)]
*  Well, I try to go to church as often as I can. I try to be a good person [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4981.18s)]
*  Nothing in of itself wrong with that. That's not a mission [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4985.900000000001s)]
*  And what happens is the mission because it becomes a little self [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4989.82s)]
*  I go to church so I can listen so I can learn so I can try to get through my week, you know [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4993.26s)]
*  And everything becomes inward those three things. Jesus said were outward. It's out out out other people other people other people [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=4997.74s)]
*  Not just you it's other people and uh, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5005.1s)]
*  Again back to my father who was sitting at a bar the guy drives up there. Why why? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5007.9s)]
*  He's not going to be a member of his church. He doesn't have any money [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5012.78s)]
*  He's a reprobate, you know, who's got a terrible reputation [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5016.62s)]
*  What drove him to drive up there that hour drive? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5021.58s)]
*  Walk into that bar. What drove him to do that? [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5025.9s)]
*  It was just for him [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5028.62s)]
*  Just for that guy. Yeah, and I thought I thought wow [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5030.86s)]
*  I don't know if I would do without drop, but I'll be like [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5035.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, but he did that it literally changed my life [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5038.06s)]

*  Yeah, I know. So we're worth it [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5057.1s)]
*  I got to see my dad and grow up with two parents worth it, you know [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5059.34s)]
*  And you look over time as then dad took that and then never went about this for money or fame or anything in fact [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5064.06s)]

*  We weren't trying to go [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5088.54s)]
*  Become famous right and so you see a lot today, you know people are like i'll do whatever it takes to get famous [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5090.86s)]

*  What are those? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5121.900000000001s)]
*  The people i've been able to meet yeah, I wouldn't know you if I wasn't [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5123.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5129.1s)]
*  Well, you wouldn't have invited me on this podcast had I not had a tv show, you know [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5130.06s)]
*  I don't know. I ran into you in an elevator in nashville. That's true, but you thought I was a homeless guy [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5133.660000000001s)]
*  I did. Yeah, you put money in my coffee [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5138.06s)]
*  Filled with dip spit [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5142.3s)]
*  Um [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5144.38s)]
*  I spit in my cup and you said [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5146.62s)]
*  He looked at me. You said did you spin your cup first words? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5148.78s)]
*  You said to me you said did you spin that cup anyone who dips in an elevator is a potential friend of mine? [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5151.66s)]
*  That's how I feel about it. And you started doing your little maniacal laugh and you started laughing so hard and uh, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5156.7s)]
*  It was so funny because of all the people I was expecting them to see it wasn't you get you do [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5163.9800000000005s)]
*  I didn't expect to catch willy robertson dipping in an elevator, but that was it. I was I was headed to my room [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5168.62s)]
*  I had been promoting this book and uh [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5173.9s)]
*  And you happen to be there as well, which is how this all ended up and I think god, you know [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5176.78s)]
*  I don't know. I think god works like that. I think he [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5181.34s)]
*  Puts people together and you know [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5183.82s)]
*  Just seems too weird to me not so I think there's those opportunities that people have and they meet and some of you take advantage [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5187.0199999999995s)]
*  Of some of you don't some of you miss some of you're like, oh crap, you know, and uh, but I just I don't know [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5192.46s)]
*  I mean why? [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5197.259999999999s)]
*  It he did that in the bible, you know, yeah, there was there was things moving around and so [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5198.94s)]
*  um [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5205.0199999999995s)]
*  So it could be for that person could be for someone else could be for something completely different [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5206.0599999999995s)]
*  You know some situation that maybe needs to to get out and so but it was interesting that [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5210.0599999999995s)]
*  I had written this book. I had decided this year. I'm not jumping in this even though it was so [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5216.7s)]
*  Tempting everybody tried to get me to you know, get involved. Let's go, you know, and uh, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5221.96s)]
*  And i'd really just said no i'm not and i'm just gonna promote this book and then [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5228.0599999999995s)]
*  And then I meet you and then you said hey, you should come on the podcast [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5233.26s)]
*  And it was scheduled for a few months ago and I went [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5237.98s)]
*  I'm gonna get pulled into the politics. I was like I said i'm gonna get pulled into this thing and uh [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5241.74s)]
*  And then as it turned around and spun around [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5248.14s)]
*  We still did podcasts after the election and then you know [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5251.98s)]
*  And that was kind of the commitment I made just don't get so [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5255.74s)]
*  Involved because I didn't want the mess. I don't I don't care what I don't I really don't care like [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5258.62s)]
*  If it's the gospel or some political agenda, i'm going with the gospel every time because this is the power [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5263.419999999999s)]
*  This is you know, if we can change people's [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5268.78s)]
*  You know, I just saw I didn't I mean it changed me [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5272.0599999999995s)]
*  But it like somebody like my father can change people's lives and turn them into completely different people [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5274.46s)]
*  And so that's what I want to get to people, you know politics turns people into completely different people too, but rarely for the better [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5281.1s)]
*  right [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5287.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean it it has its place in it, you know, and i'm not [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5289.26s)]
*  casting aspersions on people who [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5293.900000000001s)]
*  you know want our country to be you know, a great country and uh [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5296.38s)]
*  uh [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5301.5s)]
*  but [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5302.62s)]
*  We're you know [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5304.22s)]
*  I'm not even one that says we have we have to [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5306.7s)]
*  Everything's got to be like you have to have christians in every position. I mean, I mean [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5309.820000000001s)]
*  No, that's okay. I mean we can work together and figure that out [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5315.42s)]
*  Let the gospel do what it does and let politics do what it does and let government, you know [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5318.22s)]
*  So almost like rendr under caesar. What is caesar's and exactly exactly exactly. Where do you get that? [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5323.18s)]
*  Yeah, because and that's the thing had [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5330.700000000001s)]
*  back to mission [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5333.740000000001s)]
*  So i'm into that mission make disciples baptize people teach people [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5335.18s)]
*  not to you know [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5339.820000000001s)]
*  I think if jesus wanted us to just make sure your government is [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5342.14s)]
*  He would have talked about it, right? You know said yeah, let's lay out a plan and and all that [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5346.46s)]
*  Because it was you know under these governmental things that he was going to end up being crucified anyway, so [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5351.900000000001s)]
*  And those things are they're they're of the world [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5358.14s)]
*  I mean, they're you know, they're here and they come and they die and they go away and they change and you know [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5360.3s)]
*  stuff happens and you know, I was like if we [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5365.34s)]
*  If that's where we end up and I do think there's a lot of darkness for sure, but they need the gospel [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5368.46s)]
*  They don't need a better program from dc, you know [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5374.14s)]
*  And that's what'll change it. Oh, wow. Look now families are staying together and you know, it's not gonna be [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5379.26s)]
*  It's not gonna be that way and it's gonna be [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5385.66s)]
*  when the church wakes up and decides to [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5388.700000000001s)]
*  Go out and and have that kind of mission, you know is to go after [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5391.66s)]
*  But we can't hate each other. That's the problem. We can't hate each other because that's the deal man. I can't [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5396.219999999999s)]
*  Uh, and I saw that so much in this one god. I got roasted. I mean people would get my face and [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5401.259999999999s)]
*  If I said the wrong like if I said, oh i'm not i'm writing this book and i'm not [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5407.74s)]
*  Doing as much with and people just be like what? [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5411.9s)]
*  This country is we're not gonna have a country tomorrow and but [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5415.58s)]
*  What I don't like about the third it's it's like my fault [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5420.06s)]
*  It's like like they're telling me it's my fault that i'm like [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5423.900000000001s)]
*  How's it my fault, you know? [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5427.18s)]
*  And that's what we got to and then it was just bullying everywhere. Everybody's just bullying everybody [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5428.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean certainly saw that with you know, the democrats been bullying or you better vote this way [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5433.1s)]
*  You know like like we're telling you what to do and i'm just not good at people telling me what to do [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5438.06s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, don't tell me what to do. Don't tell me, you know [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5442.46s)]
*  Vote for i'm gonna vote but now it's like no you gotta do more [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5446.06s)]
*  We you know, you've got to go out and you know [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5449.34s)]
*  And do all this to understand their their passion and all that but we've got to let people [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5452.22s)]
*  And some of that's the policy. It's their job is to win the vote [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5457.820000000001s)]
*  You know, it doesn't answer the deepest questions like what happens when you die [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5461.34s)]
*  You know, it doesn't address that so when you die. Yeah. Yeah when you die when you die [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5465.18s)]
*  so my last question is if [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5470.46s)]
*  I do think a lot of people are all of a sudden wondering like is there something beyond what we can [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5472.62s)]
*  See here feel and taste. I mean is there you know, is there a spiritual realm? Is there a god? [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5479.34s)]
*  And I I people all around me are asking those questions [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5485.66s)]
*  What would you recommend to them? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5490.14s)]
*  Like how to pursue that you something stirs and you think wow, maybe I should learn more right? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5492.54s)]
*  I mean I found those answers in the uh [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5499.9800000000005s)]
*  In the bible and particularly in the new testament, you know, that's where I found those answers it comes down to the faith like [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5504.06s)]
*  you've got to have [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5510.9400000000005s)]
*  This faith and you're gonna have to jump [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5513.02s)]
*  And believe something that you can't see [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5516.3s)]
*  It's interesting how people can't do that. I remember I was talking to a god one time [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5519.18s)]
*  I was having one of these conversations. I don't know if this story's in the book, but there's a lot in there [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5522.38s)]
*  We're having this story and he's like, I don't I don't believe in faith. I don't [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5526.14s)]
*  I don't see it. I don't believe it, you know [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5529.26s)]
*  And he was he just got married and I said and we're at a we're at a hunting camp and I said [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5531.900000000001s)]
*  Where's your wife right now? He's like she's at home and she's [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5537.1s)]
*  I said, I bet she's with another guy [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5540.620000000001s)]
*  And he said [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5543.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I I love how you proselytize. Yeah, and he said no she's not [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5545.18s)]
*  And he gets I can tell he's mad. He's well. Yeah, he's been married like six months. I said, oh no for sure [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5550.06s)]
*  She's she's with another guy like no doubt [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5555.5s)]
*  And he goes no, she's not you know, what are you doing? I said, how do you know she's not? [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5558.780000000001s)]
*  He goes because I trust her and I said [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5566.3s)]
*  So you do have faith in something that you can't see [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5570.46s)]
*  And he went [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5574.14s)]
*  I've never thought about that way. It was atheist. He was he said i'm an atheist. I don't believe in any of this stuff [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5575.34s)]
*  And that was so it was just a small move though. We moved him off of that position [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5580.62s)]
*  Now we have moved him to there are some things that even though I can't see it [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5586.46s)]
*  I have faith and why do more preachers not start with that? I bet your wife's sleeping with somebody else [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5591.74s)]
*  That works [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5600.86s)]
*  Maybe they don't go to enough hunting camps [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5603.18s)]
*  I mean for me though what what else I mean like [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5606.7s)]

*  i'm trying to think of [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5617.02s)]
*  Paul says in the new testament paul who knew the gospel better than anybody who's a writer and [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5619.98s)]
*  He says pray for me that the mystery of the gospel can come out of my mouth more clearly [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5624.94s)]
*  He's praying that [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5629.58s)]
*  It can come out more clearly and my question is why why is he he knows this stuff like he wrote it, you know, he's writing [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5631.18s)]
*  Because some weren't obeying it some weren't getting it [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5638.62s)]

*  I don't think he's a christian. I don't think he's a believer. And so i'm just like hey, man [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5662.54s)]
*  Have you thought about heaven and how? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5665.66s)]
*  He would say the same thing every time to me [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5667.5s)]
*  Well, he who had not sinned cast the first stone [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5669.74s)]
*  That's what he would say. It was he was quoting a scripture and I knew what that meant. That's [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5673.5s)]
*  That's redneck for I don't want to hear what you gotta say. Yeah, i'm not interested [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5679.1s)]

*  Having some look and being a christian way more than that. That's like an hour a week. That's not that's nothing [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=5934.46s)]

*  We're halfway around the globe from where it happened [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6119.1s)]
*  And still talking about it true they had no money they had no fame they weren't soldiers and weren't you know [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6123.34s)]
*  And they didn't speak the same language. We're speaking a different language [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6129.82s)]
*  We are sitting here today halfway across the globe and we're still talking about it [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6133.1s)]
*  I'm still writing books about it living our lives on it and professing it it just [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6138.3s)]
*  That's a big deal like [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6145.34s)]
*  I haven't seen that with anything else most everything else 2 000 years ago. We don't even know what it is [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6147.34s)]
*  They're gone. Yeah, it's just gone. So we don't know their names. Yeah that at all [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6153.34s)]

*  So [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6160.96s)]
*  It turns out that youtube is suppressing our show I know [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6165.280000000001s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6170.46s)]
*  Anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear but it turns out it's happening [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6178.88s)]
*  So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6183.280000000001s)]
*  But that's a waste of time not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6185.759999999999s)]
*  Information that's true. It's not intentionally deceptive and the way to do that on youtube [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6192.139999999999s)]
*  We think is to subscribe to our channel subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuYjOTGMox4&t=6197.759999999999s)]
