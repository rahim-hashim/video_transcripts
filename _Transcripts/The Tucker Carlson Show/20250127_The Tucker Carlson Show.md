# Matt Taibbi: All the Top Secret Information Trump Is Releasing & What He Should Declassify Next
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI)
*  So everyone's mad that, even some Democrats, I think, are mad about these last-minute Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=0.0s)]
*  pardons of Fauci and the J6 committee, etc., etc. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5.86s)]
*  So let's just set that aside. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=10.34s)]
*  My concern is not that these people are punished. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=12.66s)]
*  Fauci's 81. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=15.22s)]
*  Yeah, who cares? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=16.22s)]
*  I think he'll be punished, you know, in some larger sense. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=17.22s)]
*  But I want to know what they did. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  That's the, okay, so can we just go through a couple of these? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=24.02s)]
*  Why would you pardon Fauci? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=29.06s)]
*  What are the potential crimes, the crimes you think he committed and could be punished [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=30.54s)]
*  for that you're trying to prevent him from being punished for by pardoning him? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=34.0s)]
*  Well with Fauci specifically, the one thing that comes to mind immediately is perjury [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=37.56s)]
*  because he's been accused of that essentially already by the House committee. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=44.2s)]
*  Lying under oath to the Congress. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=50.9s)]
*  Lying under oath to the Congress. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=51.96s)]
*  saying, you know, that we have never funded gain of research, that we weren't doing it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=54.68s)]
*  during this time period, even as there are other people in the government, like, you [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=62.5s)]
*  know, the deputy director of the NIH saying, yes, we were, or Ralph Baric, who was one [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=67.5s)]
*  of the scientists at UNC saying, yes, absolutely, that was a gain of function. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  So there's a little bit of a problem there. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=79.72s)]
*  Now he later amended the statement and said that he was speaking in a specific way, under [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=81.5s)]
*  a specific definition, but there's exposure there. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=87.36s)]
*  But that's, that's not really the issue with Fauci. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=90.74s)]
*  The issue... [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=94.96000000000001s)]
*  The issue is really, it's about the whole rat's nest of gain of function. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=111.5s)]
*  How much did the authorities know about what was going on at the Wuhan Institute? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=121.86s)]
*  Did they have human sources at the Wuhan Institute? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=126.38s)]
*  Was there advanced warning that this was coming? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=132.22s)]
*  Were they suppressing investigations into the possibility of a lab leak? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=134.78s)]
*  Because of the connections to US research, all that stuff is in play. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=140.94s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of stuff that's going on that you want to know. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=144.98s)]
*  So Fauci was part of the US bioweapons program, obviously, right? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=150.82s)]
*  I mean, if you're funding gain of function, it's, you know, vaccines are one part of that, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=154.85999999999999s)]
*  but probably not the only part of it, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=160.48s)]
*  So the idea is you make the virus more dangerous in order to create a vaccine to fight the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=162.2s)]
*  virus. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=165.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=166.98s)]
*  But in the process, you wind up with much more dangerous viruses. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=167.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=170.26s)]
*  And that's one of the things that raised a red flag for some of the people who are looking [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=171.26s)]
*  at the COVID phenomenon is just look at the surface characteristics of the disease. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=177.06s)]
*  It's highly transmissible. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=181.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=183.14s)]
*  It doesn't, it's not terribly symptomatic. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=184.14s)]
*  Everybody's going to get it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=188.18s)]
*  Not everybody's going to be harmed by it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=189.22s)]
*  It's what they designed, what you would do if you were designing a disease to carry a [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=192.22s)]
*  vaccine, for instance. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=199.06s)]
*  So my interest is not in Fauci. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=201.02s)]
*  I think any normal person can make up his mind about Fauci. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=202.9s)]
*  It's pretty obvious who Fauci is. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=205.46s)]
*  The super bureaucrat. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=207.24s)]
*  It's in the bioweapon programs and the Frankenstein science that's being funded by our tax dollars [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=209.26s)]
*  around the world, to be specific in Ukraine, in China, in Djibouti. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=217.06s)]
*  You know, we have biolabs in a lot of places around the world. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=223.18s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=228.62s)]
*  What are they doing? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=229.62s)]
*  What was their relation to the Wuhan Institute also? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=231.02s)]
*  I mean, I think those are all important questions, both the bioweapons and the relation to the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=235.42000000000002s)]
*  pandemic. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=242.7s)]
*  But the thing is about these pardons, they're a mistake. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=244.9s)]
*  If you want to know what's happening, they just made it a lot easier for us to find out. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=250.32s)]
*  Because now, once the pardon's delivered, the person can't plead the fifth. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=256.28s)]
*  If they're brought before a grand jury, they can't take the fifth anymore. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=261.71999999999997s)]
*  If they're brought before a congressional committee, they can't evoke their right against [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=265.47999999999996s)]
*  self-incrimination. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=270.14s)]
*  So they have to say something. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=271.44s)]
*  And this is what's so interesting, because I've been talking to criminal defense attorneys, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=273.96s)]
*  people who are former Senate investigators, some current Senate investigators, and they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=278.34s)]
*  all kind of said the same thing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  It's so illogical to give somebody a pardon if you're trying to cover up things, that [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=285.66s)]
*  the only reason you would really do it is if there's very serious crimes involved. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=292.98s)]
*  So that's a red flag for us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=297.86s)]
*  When we see somebody getting a pardon, we think, well, why would they do that unless [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=299.54s)]
*  there's something really bad there? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=304.98s)]
*  So either it's a mistake where they just stupidly made it easier for everybody to investigate, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=306.86s)]
*  or there's something we don't know about that is interesting. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=313.54s)]
*  Well, it's such a profound thing to do. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=316.14000000000004s)]
*  If somebody said to you, Matt, would you accept a pardon? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=319.26000000000005s)]
*  You would say, well, why would I need a pardon? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=322.54s)]
*  No. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=325.18s)]
*  I mean, it's like it's incriminating. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=326.18s)]
*  It's morally incriminating, or it has the appearance of moral incrimination just by [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=328.66s)]
*  its fact, right? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  It's not only morally incriminating, it's legally incriminating. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=334.22s)]
*  Justice itself said in a memo, I think, on one of the J6 cases, it said, this does not [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=338.7s)]
*  unring the bell of conviction if you get a pardon going forward. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  So you're making an admission if you accept a pardon. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=350.74s)]
*  So yeah, I wouldn't accept one if I were totally innocent. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=354.68s)]
*  Of course. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=358.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  And also, I wouldn't accept one if I had something to hide, because now, if I'm dragged before [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=360.53999999999996s)]
*  a congressional committee or especially a grand jury investigation, now I can't tap [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=365.5s)]
*  out and say, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm going to take the fifth on that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=369.88s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=373.54s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=374.54s)]
*  So the whole thing is really illogical. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=375.54s)]
*  I think it was more meant to be a symbolic gesture. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=379.54s)]
*  And this is really, I think, speaks to the thinking of the Biden administration about [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=384.34s)]
*  so many things, right? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=389.22s)]
*  They were so driven by optics with Trump that they did a lot of things that were incredibly [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=390.5s)]
*  stupid. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=396.06s)]
*  So they want to portray him as vengeful and out to get people. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=397.06s)]
*  And the pardons are a good way to do that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=402.54s)]
*  I mean, if you're aiming for that audience. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=404.94s)]
*  But it had the negative effect of opening all these investigations up, it seems to me. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=407.68s)]
*  So you really think this was aimed at MSNBC viewers, just to paint Trump as a vindictive [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=413.46s)]
*  person? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=418.94s)]
*  So I asked a lot of people, why did they do this? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=420.18s)]
*  What's the point? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=423.3s)]
*  And one of the theories was that this is messaging, that they were trying to create a headline. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=425.62s)]
*  And there were lots of headlines instantaneously. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=432.62s)]
*  If you saw them, they all basically said the same thing, like, you know, to ward off future [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=434.66s)]
*  vindictive retaliatory acts by the Trump administration, you know, Biden issues pardons. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=440.22s)]
*  That's one theory. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=447.41999999999996s)]
*  The other theory is that in the last days of a presidential administration, it gets [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=451.02s)]
*  pretty chaotic in the White House and people who want things and, you know, they will come [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=457.06s)]
*  in and there will be a hurried frenzy to put stuff on paper. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=463.18s)]
*  And that's why there are unprecedented things in these pardons. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=467.58s)]
*  For instance, the J6 pardons. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=471.21999999999997s)]
*  This has never happened before where you give a pardon to a category of unnamed people, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=473.82s)]
*  right? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=478.74s)]
*  It says to the members of the committee, to the Capitol police officers who testified, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=480.34s)]
*  to the staff, but it doesn't delineate the names of the people who are pardoned. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=485.14s)]
*  So now, if you want to invoke your pardon, you actually have to go over a test to prove [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=491.5s)]
*  that you're actually part of that category that I testified before the committee. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=500.54s)]
*  Does that mean that the committee called you, that you talked to a staffer once, or does [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=504.58s)]
*  that mean you actually sat in front of the hall and testified? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=508.94s)]
*  It's very weird. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=512.18s)]
*  And the only explanation that I could come up with from people is that they were in a [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=513.62s)]
*  hurry. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=517.66s)]
*  They didn't have all the names. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=518.66s)]
*  It's amazing, right? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=519.66s)]
*  So, but why would you preemptively pardon the J6 committee? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=522.06s)]
*  I mean, that's like the single most legitimate, morally empowered, great group of people ever [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=527.0600000000001s)]
*  impaneled in this country. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=533.7s)]
*  Like truly. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=535.86s)]
*  Well, I mean, there are obviously some theories about why they would do that, right? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=536.86s)]
*  Mother Teresa, she was such a great person, we're going to preemptively pardon her. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=545.18s)]
*  Like, what? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=548.46s)]
*  This is like crazy. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=549.46s)]
*  No, it is absolutely crazy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=551.02s)]
*  If I were some of those people, I'd be offended. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=554.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  Especially the people who testified and who didn't lie under oath, for instance, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=558.0600000000001s)]
*  Because they're all named. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  All the police officers who testified to the committee. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=568.4200000000001s)]
*  Now what if they're only really trying to protect a couple of them and there are some [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=572.22s)]
*  very conspicuous names. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=576.34s)]
*  I think we know who they are. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=577.74s)]
*  Right, yeah, exactly. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=579.58s)]
*  The ones they're trying to protect. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=580.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=582.0600000000001s)]
*  They're one of the other ones who just gave some testimony. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=583.0999999999999s)]
*  They interviewed hundreds, probably thousands of people, right? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=586.42s)]
*  It's some number like that. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=590.9799999999999s)]
*  A massive number. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=591.9799999999999s)]
*  I assume most of them told the truth. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=592.9799999999999s)]
*  Most people do tell the truth, actually, I think. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=596.18s)]
*  I think that's probably the case, yeah. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=598.5s)]
*  Especially if you're under oath and you're a law enforcement officer, it's a very serious [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=601.0999999999999s)]
*  thing to lie in those situations. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=605.02s)]
*  There are a couple of places in the testimony where it doesn't look good for some of the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=608.3399999999999s)]
*  people who testified, but for the vast majority of them, I would take it as a grievous insult [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=612.3s)]
*  to be given that pardon and especially to not be named. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=618.54s)]
*  That's what's so weird about it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=623.02s)]
*  But it suggests what I have thought from the first week, which is there are serious crimes [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=624.3599999999999s)]
*  here. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=629.4599999999999s)]
*  You talk to Steve Sund, who ran Capitol Police, who's a non-political person, just career [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  law enforcement, former MP, former Washington, DC cop. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=637.26s)]
*  I don't think he has any weird agenda. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=641.6600000000001s)]
*  His story is so unbelievable. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=643.6600000000001s)]
*  They just didn't give him any intel at all and didn't give him any resources and everybody [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=646.2800000000001s)]
*  else knew this was happening except him. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=649.7s)]
*  The whole thing is so nuts that you're like, wait, there's something going on here. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=651.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't really know. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=655.22s)]
*  The pipe bombs at the headquarters? [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=656.22s)]
*  The pipe bombs, the gallows that was erected by some weird unknown group the night before. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=657.7800000000001s)]
*  Will we ever get disclosure? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=663.74s)]
*  I guess that's what I want. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=665.1800000000001s)]
*  I just want to know. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  Again, I am not vengeful. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=667.1800000000001s)]
*  I don't really want to punish people so much as I just want to know. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=668.82s)]
*  That feels like punishment enough. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=672.74s)]
*  Will we? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=673.9000000000001s)]
*  I think we will. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=674.9000000000001s)]
*  I think we're heading into a golden age for investigative journalism. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=675.9000000000001s)]
*  I think this is after eight years of crazy, misleading news stories and dead ends and [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=680.6600000000001s)]
*  unanswered questions and fake news, ranging from Russiagate to Nord Stream to the COVID [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=689.0200000000001s)]
*  origins where we were actively kept away from one side of that story for years. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=697.98s)]
*  I think we're going to find out a lot of this stuff. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=703.58s)]
*  There are investigations already underway, document hunts going on all over the place. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=706.04s)]
*  There are reports that have been commissioned to look into a lot of these questions and [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=712.7s)]
*  they're going to be staffed up with a lot of money and a lot of personnel. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=719.54s)]
*  It's just an unprecedented situation where, for instance, the DHS or the FBI or the DOJ [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=725.5s)]
*  would be in sync with congressional investigators to the point where they're not going to have [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=732.14s)]
*  to issue subpoenas for a lot of this stuff. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=736.3s)]
*  They're just going to sit down and say, here's a list of the documents we want to find. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=738.82s)]
*  I think that they're going to have that collaborative arrangement. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=743.78s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=746.58s)]
*  There's panic. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=748.66s)]
*  I sense panic. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=749.66s)]
*  I sense it in some of these confirmation battles, particularly the offline stuff that you don't [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=751.5s)]
*  see in the media, but just when you find out the lengths to which Permanent Washington [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=755.78s)]
*  is going to say, sabotage Tulsi Gabbard, who's an army officer, who's had a clearance for [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=759.98s)]
*  more than a decade, carries an automatic weapon. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=766.26s)]
*  Clearly, we trust her with America's defense. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=768.26s)]
*  Why can't we trust her with America's secrets? [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=772.4599999999999s)]
*  Well, of course, we can. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=774.3399999999999s)]
*  What is this? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=776.54s)]
*  It really is, people are panicked that what they've been doing is going to come to light, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=777.62s)]
*  I think. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, they should be panicked because if you read the executive order on the weaponization [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=782.6999999999999s)]
*  of government, it specifically empowers the director of national intelligence to conduct [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=787.38s)]
*  a wide-ranging report into the possible misdeeds of the entire intelligence community and orders [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=794.18s)]
*  her to come up with anything negative that they can find. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=801.4599999999999s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=806.02s)]
*  Can you imagine? [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=807.02s)]
*  No. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=808.02s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=809.02s)]
*  I mean, that's like trying to make a list of everything. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=810.02s)]
*  She'll be doing it from now to the end of time. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=815.22s)]
*  But no, I mean, in perfect seriousness, it's setting the stage for kind of a second church [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=817.54s)]
*  committee hearings era, and that was a great moment in American history. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=824.6999999999999s)]
*  Once every 50 years. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=830.5799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=831.5799999999999s)]
*  We find out what they're doing with their black budgets. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=832.5799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=834.5799999999999s)]
*  Really, in the mid-70s, who would have known that we were doing such an incredibly wide-ranging [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=836.14s)]
*  list of horrible, stupid things from trying to murder Castro with exploding seashells [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=846.0600000000001s)]
*  to spying on Martin Luther King Jr. to trying to leak news about mistresses of civil rights [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=852.38s)]
*  leaders? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=859.98s)]
*  I mean, the list went on and on and on, and we only found out about it because they went [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=860.98s)]
*  too far, right? [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=864.98s)]
*  And now suddenly, people in the Senate had a hammer to start looking into this direction, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=867.14s)]
*  and it all came out. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=875.82s)]
*  Well, not all of it, but a lot of it came out. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=876.82s)]
*  A lot of it. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=878.46s)]
*  Frank Church, sadly, got incredibly fast-developing cancer, I noticed. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=879.46s)]
*  Did he? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=883.34s)]
*  Yes, he did. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=884.34s)]
*  He did kind of like Jack Ruby-style cancer, Hugo Chavez-style cancer. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=885.34s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=888.74s)]
*  Huh. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=889.74s)]
*  I did not know that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=890.74s)]
*  Yeah, couldn't treat it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=891.74s)]
*  He died. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=892.74s)]
*  Sad. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=893.74s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=895.5s)]
*  No, it's all right. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=896.5s)]
*  I mean, look, it's hard not to think. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=897.5s)]
*  I never thought this way until like a year ago, maybe a year and a half ago. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=898.5s)]
*  I did not, either. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=903.9s)]
*  Now I did not think this way. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=904.9s)]
*  I attacked anyone who did. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=906.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=908.14s)]
*  But can I say one thing that I've noticed now that I'm in middle age is that all my [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=909.14s)]
*  life, the older guys I've known, like you go on duck hunting trips or whatever in Washington, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=914.34s)]
*  where I lived, like with my dad and his friends or whatever, and the guys who were in their [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=918.9s)]
*  50s and 60s all thought this way. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=923.3s)]
*  They all thought this way. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=926.14s)]
*  After like a lifetime of government service as an operations officer, whatever you're [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=927.46s)]
*  doing, right? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=930.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=931.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=932.78s)]
*  They all had this mindset. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=933.78s)]
*  I remember sitting like in a duck blind thinking, these guys are fucking crazy. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=934.78s)]
*  They're all nuts. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=938.06s)]
*  What I didn't realize was there's a reason that people become more open to these sorts [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=939.62s)]
*  of explanations the more they see. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=946.98s)]
*  Of course. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=950.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=951.5799999999999s)]
*  I don't know why I didn't get that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=952.5799999999999s)]
*  It's probably just our generation that thought the schoolhouse rock thing was true. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=955.14s)]
*  I mean, right? [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=959.3399999999999s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=962.38s)]
*  Because we grew up with all the president's men and after the church committee. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=963.38s)]
*  We thought it all had come out. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=968.3s)]
*  The good guys won. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=970.2199999999999s)]
*  There's transparency. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=971.6999999999999s)]
*  We have the Freedom of Information Act. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=972.8199999999999s)]
*  We can find everything out. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=974.42s)]
*  No. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=976.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=977.06s)]
*  It turns out no. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=978.06s)]
*  Right? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=979.06s)]
*  No. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=980.06s)]
*  I thought of Schoolhouse Rock and all the president's men as sophisticated propaganda [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=981.8199999999999s)]
*  put there by the intel agencies, but I think you're right. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=985.66s)]

*  to anybody who wants to buy it, including governments. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1010.58s)]
*  No privacy whatsoever. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1013.62s)]
*  Obviously, it should be illegal. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1014.62s)]
*  It's not illegal. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1016.38s)]
*  People are getting paid off to keep it legal. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1017.38s)]
*  Politicians specifically. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1019.98s)]
*  Politicians, by the way, are some of the ones using your data. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1020.98s)]
*  They buy it and then employ it in campaigns to swing your vote. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1026.76s)]
*  It's creepy as hell. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1031.98s)]
*  There's a way to get around it though. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1033.9s)]

*  think you're one of the great reporters still working. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1071.0600000000002s)]
*  Not that there are many. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1073.0600000000002s)]
*  Not that there's a ton of competition. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1074.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there aren't many. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1075.0600000000002s)]
*  You are, by your nature, a curious person, which is requirement one for journalism. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1079.3400000000001s)]
*  The one thing no one else seems curious about, I think, but you are. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1085.7s)]
*  Can you just go through in no particular order the stories whose endings you'd like to know? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1088.18s)]
*  What are you curious about as we enter an age of disclosure, God willing we do, what [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1095.82s)]
*  do you want to know? [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1101.4199999999998s)]
*  So, first of all, just to back up, I tried to make a list a couple of days ago. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1102.4199999999998s)]
*  Oh, did you really? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1107.02s)]
*  Yeah, of all the things that I would want to investigate if I were in that kind of a [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1108.02s)]
*  position to order these kinds of things. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1113.62s)]
*  I'm actually going to take notes as you talk because I'm going to follow along at home [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1115.62s)]
*  as this happens. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1118.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1119.78s)]
*  But I couldn't finish. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1120.78s)]
*  There were so many different things that I never got to the end, but I would say that [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1124.02s)]
*  the big ones, there are huge glaring questions, which is unusual. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1127.42s)]
*  For instance, who was president the last four years, especially the last year? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1133.7s)]
*  I mean, I think that's an enormous question. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1138.82s)]
*  Tony Blinken. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1142.7s)]
*  Do you think it was Blinken? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1143.7s)]
*  I think Blinken's so evil, so demonstrably evil and also stupid that I just see his fingerprints [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1145.86s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1153.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1154.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1155.96s)]
*  But that's just a pure guess. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1156.96s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1159.72s)]
*  We don't really know. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1160.72s)]
*  I know that in the last two months, Blinken did everything he could to accelerate the [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1161.72s)]
*  war between the United States and Russia, which should be illegal. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1165.0s)]
*  I don't know how he got away with that. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1169.8400000000001s)]
*  Nobody said anything about it, but that's a fact. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1171.16s)]
*  So anyway, sorry to interrupt you. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1173.92s)]
*  His State Department was also involved in the censorship stuff too. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1176.76s)]
*  Who was president? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1181.64s)]
*  Who was president? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1182.64s)]
*  Let's start with the big question. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1185.3200000000002s)]
*  No, I mean, I think of all the crimes that are on the table and the potential corruption [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1186.3200000000002s)]
*  issues, people signing documents or somehow getting documents signed by an incompetent [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1191.16s)]
*  president or an unfit president has to rank up there with the most serious things that [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1199.8000000000002s)]
*  have ever happened in American history. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1205.2800000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1208.44s)]
*  You have to look at what was the process of the White House operation. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1209.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1216.8s)]
*  Who was actually running things? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1217.8s)]
*  We know from a surface point who held the posts. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1220.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1225.24s)]
*  So Ron Klain was the chief of staff. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1226.24s)]
*  We know roughly who else was in Joe Biden's orbit. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1228.5s)]
*  What was the schedule? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1233.92s)]
*  You know, did he sign things by auto pen? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1234.92s)]
*  Because they have this machine that does. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1238.0800000000002s)]
*  And who basically had the power of attorney to turn that on. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1241.2800000000002s)]
*  Right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1245.5200000000002s)]
*  These are all questions that we have to get answers to. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1246.5200000000002s)]
*  What was the day to day operation of the Biden White House? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1249.0400000000002s)]
*  And again, especially in the last year, because I think that gets to bigger questions of who [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  was really making these big foreign policy decisions and who was making decisions about [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1259.5600000000002s)]
*  things like, you know, cutting off the Democratic primaries to challengers. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1265.52s)]
*  You know, these are big party decisions, not necessarily White House decisions. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1271.8s)]
*  Who decided to kick Biden off the ticket? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1277.56s)]
*  Biden on July 13th was giving a speech in Detroit and he's like, I'm running. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1282.72s)]
*  I mean, he couldn't have been more affirmative about the idea that he was not going to [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1289.76s)]
*  drop out of the race within seven days. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1295.16s)]
*  He was out of the race within three days after that Detroit thing. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1297.28s)]
*  There were stories leaked out in Politico that were basically saying that Nancy Pelosi [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1301.64s)]
*  was going to ask him to or going to try to pressure him to drop out. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1305.3200000000002s)]
*  But I don't believe that. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1309.96s)]
*  I think we need to find out exactly what those communications were. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1311.88s)]
*  I mean, who had the authority to push the president of the United States off his own [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1315.28s)]
*  ticket unless he had a sudden change of heart? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1319.28s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1324.76s)]
*  I think it's really obvious that his statement dropping out on Twitter was issued before [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1326.52s)]
*  he knew. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1331.36s)]
*  I mean, I've heard that again. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1332.36s)]
*  I don't know is the truth, but I've heard that it's very conspicuous that when he when [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1334.36s)]
*  he wanted to say things, he said it on camera. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1339.64s)]
*  But there were all kinds of things where the wording was much more careful and that was [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1342.72s)]
*  done on Twitter or in a letter or in a press release. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1347.24s)]
*  I mean, even the note explaining the pardons, who wrote that? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1351.08s)]
*  It was on Biden's Twitter account. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1356.44s)]
*  I doubt he's sitting there tweeting. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1358.8s)]
*  So it's just a coup. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1361.36s)]
*  I mean, that's a coup. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1362.36s)]
*  If you take a sitting president of the United States and force him to drop out, I mean, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1363.36s)]
*  right? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1369.04s)]
*  It's on the table. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1370.04s)]
*  It has to be because Jill Biden has been very circumspect in talking about it. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1371.04s)]
*  Said these really curious things about how she wants to reevaluate her relationships. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1378.16s)]
*  I think she was referring to Nancy Pelosi. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1382.72s)]
*  But what exactly happened in that one week period between the middle of July and the [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1386.5600000000002s)]
*  21st or so? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1394.8400000000001s)]
*  And then what happened between the 21st and the 22nd or whenever it was when Biden suddenly [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1396.44s)]
*  came out and made Kamala the nominee? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1402.3200000000002s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1406.96s)]
*  Who made that decision? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1408.48s)]
*  So that was after the Republican convention. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1409.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1412.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1413.68s)]
*  So you had this incredible week or two where Trump gets shot, survives, you have the convention [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1414.68s)]
*  and Biden drops out. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1424.2s)]
*  I mean, that's and as far as I know, I don't think anyone's ever done like a real TikTok [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1425.2s)]
*  on that. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1430.92s)]
*  No. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1431.92s)]
*  There were stories, but they were incredibly incomplete. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1433.88s)]
*  And this is one of the things where I was looking at it even from just a professionalism [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1437.2s)]
*  point of view in terms of the New York Times, the Washington Post, all of these papers. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1442.52s)]
*  How does nobody ask who made the decision to nominate Kamala Harris? [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1447.8400000000001s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1454.68s)]
*  How was he kicked off? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1457.4s)]
*  Or how did he come to that decision? [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1459.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, there would be a big show of that. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1462.52s)]
*  Somebody would come out and give an interview to, I don't know, 60 minutes and say, well, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1465.84s)]
*  here's how that happened. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1470.92s)]
*  And whether it was true or not, there would be a grand explanation whenever there's something [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1472.52s)]
*  big that happens with the president. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1478.24s)]
*  Here they just kind of did a little tweet or press release and there were things that [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1480.88s)]
*  were leaked out in newspapers. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1485.96s)]
*  None of it made any sense. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1488.1200000000001s)]
*  So they have to get all those communications. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1489.84s)]
*  And I think that's what was important. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1492.36s)]
*  There were preservation letters that were sent out by some Senate committees. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1494.72s)]
*  I hope it captured a lot of this stuff, but we'll see. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1497.56s)]
*  Do you have any sense of what the answer is to either one of these questions? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1502.52s)]
*  Who was functionally operating the Biden administration and who kicked Biden out? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1507.76s)]
*  Who made these decisions? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1513.04s)]
*  I've only heard theories about this. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1514.04s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1517.52s)]
*  It's kind of irresponsible for reporters to speculate. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1519.8s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1522.48s)]
*  All we know, we saw little bits and pieces of things. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1523.48s)]
*  There was a really weird moment. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1527.3999999999999s)]
*  You might remember when Biden said something to the effect of, we can't allow Putin to [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1529.6s)]
*  stay in office or whatever it was. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1535.68s)]
*  And people immediately interpreted that as a regime change comment. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1538.6s)]
*  37 minutes later, the White House comes out with a walk back clarifying statement saying, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  our policy towards Russia is unchanged or something ambiguous like that. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1550.3600000000001s)]
*  But there were leaks in the press about what happened there. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1554.92s)]
*  And there was a remarkable line in one of those stories saying that Biden was allowed [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1558.3200000000002s)]
*  to participate in the workshopping of that second statement. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1563.0800000000002s)]
*  How is he not in charge of it, first of all? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1569.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1572.16s)]
*  They're talking about Jake Sullivan is involved in the process. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1573.64s)]
*  But that just gives you a little glimpse into this idea of a collective presidency where [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1578.1200000000001s)]
*  at best Biden was a participant. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1583.64s)]
*  So I think we need to know a lot of things about who was actually making those decisions. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1587.4s)]
*  It might be different in terms of, you know, for each realm of the government, right? [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1595.0400000000002s)]
*  Maybe the national security questions were dealt with by one person, then the foreign [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1600.56s)]
*  policy things by another. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1605.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1607.6s)]
*  I mean, we'll see. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1608.6s)]
*  And then domestic policy, which doesn't even really exist in this country. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1611.0s)]
*  It's all national security, like runs everything. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1613.92s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1617.0s)]
*  Who's doing that? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1618.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1620.0s)]
*  Oh, that was only the first thing in the list, right? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1621.0s)]
*  No, you know, it's so funny as you say this, and I won't interrupt you anymore, but I just [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1623.48s)]
*  can't. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1627.84s)]
*  I mean, it's like crazy. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1628.84s)]
*  This just happened this summer. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1630.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1632.12s)]
*  And I was there. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1633.12s)]
*  I mean, I know a lot of the people. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1634.12s)]
*  I feel like I'm not that informed, but maybe more informed than average because it's my [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1635.76s)]
*  job. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1640.08s)]
*  I kind of forgot about all this stuff. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1641.08s)]
*  Like so much stuff has happened. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1643.1599999999999s)]
*  It's like, it's amazing. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1645.0s)]
*  What we have allowed to sort of pass by us without demanding answers. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1647.84s)]
*  I mean, I remember being in Russia in the late 90s. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1652.08s)]
*  There were multiple episodes that you might classify as quasi coups. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1656.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1662.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1663.44s)]
*  There was an episode where people tried to arrest Yeltsin's bodyguard, Alexander Karshakov, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1664.44s)]
*  and it kind of turned out the other way in the end. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1671.72s)]
*  But there was intense reporting about this by the supposedly unfree Russian press at [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1674.96s)]
*  the time. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1681.56s)]
*  And then there was also the whole question of why was Putin brought in? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1682.6s)]
*  What did he do when he was immediately kind of used to clamp down on an investigation [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1688.9599999999998s)]
*  of Yeltsin that was done by the general prosecutor at the time? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1696.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, that's all in the weeds. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1699.4399999999998s)]
*  What I'm trying to say is even in a third world country, we got more information about [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1700.9199999999998s)]
*  stuff that was going on than we got last year in the United States of America, where we [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1708.32s)]
*  had a gigantic press corps sitting in Washington supposedly covering all this stuff. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1712.6000000000001s)]
*  It blows my mind. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1720.08s)]
*  I mean, you've done this your whole life, so you know and you grew up in it. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1721.08s)]
*  So you must still know people in that gigantic press corps. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1724.56s)]
*  A few, but you know, the ones that I'm still in touch with mostly have been kind of squeezed [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1729.04s)]
*  out. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1736.08s)]
*  You know, there are people who did try to get to the bottom of what happened. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1737.08s)]
*  I mean, Cy Hirsch did a story about the mechanics of how it got to be went from Biden to Kamala. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1742.8s)]
*  And, you know, that story came out on Substack, but it wasn't picked up anywhere. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1750.8s)]
*  And that's kind of the way the media works. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1756.2s)]
*  Cy Hirsch also broke the story that the United States, NATO, the Biden administration was [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1757.92s)]
*  behind the sabotage of Nord Stream, the natural gas pipeline to Western Europe, to Germany. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1762.9199999999998s)]
*  And that, I mean, that's on the list too, obviously. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1768.9199999999998s)]
*  But that's, I mean, I think we can say that's true. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1771.6399999999999s)]
*  And I mean, why isn't Cy Hirsch getting the Pulitzer for that? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1777.1599999999999s)]
*  Why, you know, he was immediately, this guy's been a hero on the left for my entire life [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  before I was born. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1784.8s)]
*  He was a hero on the left. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1786.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden everyone's like, shut up, Putin apologist. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1789.08s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1791.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1793.08s)]
*  And you know, all this is just, ah, it drives me insane. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1794.08s)]
*  It drives me insane. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1796.8s)]
*  But not only are there almost no good reporters left, the few good reporters left are like [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1797.8s)]
*  attacked all the time. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1801.84s)]
*  Yeah, they've all been kicked to the curb. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1802.84s)]
*  You know, it's, I think it's very notable that a lot of the high profile investigative [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1807.04s)]
*  reporters just can't even publish in the United States. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1811.92s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  And you know, look at somebody like Jeff Girth, who writes, who made a point of kind of keeping [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1816.44s)]
*  ties to traditional media and not burning bridges and doing all that stuff and worked [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1823.6000000000001s)]
*  his butt off to get this 24,000 word piece about Russiagate into the Columbia Journalism [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1830.64s)]
*  Review and it should have landed hard. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1837.2800000000002s)]
*  It should have landed like a Mike Tyson uppercut, you know? [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1841.0s)]
*  And people just ignored it. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1844.64s)]
*  So even when they don't kick you out of the club, they just ignore the hardcore reporting. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1847.0s)]
*  And Jeff Girth, for people who were under 40, was definitely one of the most famous [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1851.56s)]
*  investigative reporters in the world and feared. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1856.56s)]
*  Yeah, the New York Times front page. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1859.6s)]
*  Worst, Jeff Girth. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1862.04s)]
*  Big deal guy for many, many years. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1863.04s)]
*  He was the bulldog going after the Clinton administration on everything, right? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1865.84s)]
*  So I mean, when he did a story, it mattered. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1870.32s)]
*  He was on the desk of every senator in the country. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1873.48s)]
*  Of course. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1875.4s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1876.4s)]
*  And that's what's so interesting about this period is that there is none of that. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1877.4s)]
*  The stuff that lands on the desks of people in the relevant committees in Washington is [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1882.52s)]
*  PR. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1889.0800000000002s)]
*  There's no reporting there for the most part. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1890.56s)]
*  Maybe that will change now. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1893.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1894.96s)]
*  But you know, I doubt it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1895.96s)]
*  People read your stuff, I happen to know. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1899.68s)]
*  So that's good. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1901.56s)]
*  That would be great. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  They do. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1903.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1904.6799999999998s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1905.6799999999998s)]
*  But Nord Stream, don't forget that. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1906.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay, so Nord Stream. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1908.6799999999998s)]
*  Let's go to Nord Stream. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1909.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'm going to stop interrupting. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1910.6799999999998s)]
*  Nord Stream. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1911.6799999999998s)]
*  What do we know? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1912.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, we know that there's five or six shifting official explanations of what happened. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1913.6799999999998s)]
*  They eventually settled on this kind of labyrinthine story about a rogue Ukrainian operation that [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1921.6s)]
*  apparently without our input went and did this. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1932.6s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1937.24s)]
*  I mean, it's laughable to think that that's true. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1939.24s)]
*  But that's the kind of... [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1943.6s)]
*  Nord Stream is just one... [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like looking up at the stars in the sky. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1947.9199999999998s)]
*  That's just one of them. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1949.8999999999999s)]
*  And that's a huge story. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1952.08s)]
*  I mean, think about it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1953.36s)]
*  That could have started... [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1954.36s)]
*  It destroyed the German economy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1955.36s)]
*  It will destroy the EU. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1956.36s)]
*  Ultimately, when people wake up from their dream state, it will destroy NATO because [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1957.6399999999999s)]
*  it was an attack by one NATO power on a NATO ally. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1962.04s)]
*  Another NATO member was attacked by the United States on Germany. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1966.1999999999998s)]
*  And it wrecked the German economy. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1969.3999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1971.1999999999998s)]
*  It strained the incoming relations. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1972.1999999999998s)]
*  And it could have resulted in an immediate nuclear escalation. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1974.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, there are so many different things. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1983.3999999999999s)]
*  It was a massive ecological disaster. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1985.32s)]
*  It was a Deepwater Horizon level environmental event. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1987.08s)]
*  The greatest manmade emission of carbon dioxide in history. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1991.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1994.84s)]
*  And it's a tiny footnote to the insane lunacies that happened during this period. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=1995.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, but it is. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2003.64s)]
*  Nord Stream is... [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2004.88s)]
*  If you're making a list of the 10 weirdest things that happened in the last eight years, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2006.04s)]
*  it's probably at the bottom, I would think. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2013.3999999999999s)]
*  I mean, don't you think? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2015.04s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2017.72s)]
*  I just, you know, I like Western Europe. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2018.72s)]
*  I think it's important to have a thriving Western Europe. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2020.8s)]
*  I don't think they're a rival. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2022.9199999999998s)]
*  I think they're a complementary region to the United States. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2024.76s)]
*  And to see it destroyed intentionally by the Biden administration, let's just wreck Western [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2028.52s)]
*  Europe. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2033.24s)]
*  Like, why would you do that? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2034.24s)]
*  And so I'm fixated on it. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2035.24s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2037.8799999999999s)]
*  So what are the others? [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2039.6799999999998s)]
*  So COVID? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2041.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2042.76s)]
*  I mean, there are so many different areas where they're going to have to investigate, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2043.76s)]
*  reinvestigate that. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2050.32s)]
*  We just went through a period where, you know, there was sort of mass stonewalling of Congress [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2052.64s)]
*  when it was trying to investigate what happened with COVID. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2059.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, people that were key people, like Peter Dazak from the EcoHealth Alliance who [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2063.08s)]
*  just didn't answer subpoenas, right? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2068.44s)]
*  So we're going to, there are documents that we know exist that we're going to get now, [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2071.28s)]
*  you know, with FBI communications between the Bureau and a lot of these scientists, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2078.1200000000003s)]
*  you know, dating back 10 years. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2084.36s)]
*  And it's going to tell a very crazy story. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2088.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, a really interesting story. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2090.5600000000004s)]
*  There's a reason why Fauci's pardon is backdated to 2014, because that's the time period [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2091.88s)]
*  that they're going to have to start looking, which is, you know, when did we start defying [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2100.76s)]
*  the ban on gain of function research? [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2106.6400000000003s)]
*  We clearly did. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2108.88s)]
*  I think that's pretty established at this point. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2110.28s)]
*  Why were we doing it? [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2115.2400000000002s)]
*  What connection did that have to the Wuhan thing? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2117.0400000000004s)]
*  What kind of advance notice did we get? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2119.88s)]
*  What kind of lies were told about it? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2123.32s)]
*  Who were responsible for those lies? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2126.44s)]
*  What information did we get about the inefficacy of the vaccine? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2128.68s)]
*  And how did that connect to statements by the CDC and the White House? [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2133.44s)]
*  This also connects to the censorship issue in a major way, because there was also a sort [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2138.48s)]
*  of massive effort to control the public conversation about this that went through the health agencies. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2145.6s)]
*  So we know they're looking at that. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2153.68s)]
*  And that's another executive order, by the way. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2155.92s)]
*  The free speech order directs them, the Department of Justice, to come up with a comprehensive [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2158.44s)]
*  review of all the censorship stuff. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2165.6s)]
*  So we're going to find out about that. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2167.52s)]
*  But I just think COVID is a gigantic rat's nest of stuff. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2170.0s)]
*  And it's going to be like a Turkish shoot. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2174.84s)]
*  Every direction they look, they're going to find something revelatory. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2177.64s)]
*  The question is, will that information reach the public? [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2182.48s)]
*  Because the intermediaries, the media, so congressional investigators, executive branch [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2187.12s)]
*  agencies like DOJ, they're constantly, inspectors general, they're always releasing reports. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2193.04s)]
*  And no one reads them because nobody picks them up in the media. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2198.08s)]
*  Do we have enough interested reporters to disseminate what they find? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2200.92s)]
*  I think we do, because I think that what we think of as the media is dead. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2206.68s)]
*  They no longer really matter. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2212.4s)]
*  The media that matters now are people like you and Joe Rogan and other, you know, there's [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2216.32s)]
*  podcasters out there. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2224.64s)]
*  There's this gigantic, thriving independent media culture that turned the last election, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2226.4s)]
*  clearly. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2233.6800000000003s)]
*  It was also abundantly clear that the old media no longer had any ability to control [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2234.6800000000003s)]
*  the narrative about anything. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2241.8399999999997s)]
*  They're totally discredited. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2243.72s)]
*  So I think this stuff is going to come out and because it's going to be so explosive, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2245.24s)]
*  it's going to sort of solidify and heighten the prestige of all this new media. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2251.52s)]
*  I think we're probably going to see whole institutions that are going to be built around [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2257.24s)]
*  these disclosures. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2261.24s)]
*  We're going to have new newspapers, new TV stations. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2262.24s)]
*  So you normally save this for the end, but I'm feeling so enthusiastic. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2265.16s)]
*  I'm going to do it now in case people don't get to the end. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2268.4399999999996s)]
*  Where do people find you? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2270.4399999999996s)]
*  How do they support you if you've made it this far in this conversation? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2271.52s)]
*  You're like, this guy's unbelievable. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2276.08s)]
*  How did I'm sorry, shamelessly promote for this. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2277.92s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2280.68s)]
*  No, I'm at racket.news on Substack where a lot of these new sites are. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2281.68s)]
*  For those who didn't grow up playing squash, how are you spelling racket? [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2287.84s)]
*  R-A-C-K-E-T dot news. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2291.72s)]
*  So racket. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2295.2s)]
*  So not squash racket. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2296.2s)]
*  Not squash racket like racket. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2297.68s)]
*  That's a racket, which this is. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2299.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2301.72s)]
*  Turned out to be aptly named. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2302.72s)]
*  Nice. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2304.72s)]
*  But yeah, no, I'm feeling very optimistic now. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2305.72s)]
*  I think there are still some holes in this new media landscape. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2308.64s)]
*  We don't have the huge institutions that have reporters who have beats, which I think is [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2315.28s)]
*  crucial, right? [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2321.04s)]
*  Because you need to have people who develop sources in one small area. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2322.84s)]
*  I agree. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2326.36s)]
*  But you saw that with Julie Kelly on January 6th. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2327.76s)]
*  Julie Kelly, I don't even know what she did before. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2331.8s)]
*  She's purely kind of a creation of the internet. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2334.08s)]
*  Well, she's a self creation, but her medium was the internet and X specifically. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2336.48s)]
*  And she's got mad about January 6th and just relentlessly focused on that. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2341.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm sure she has other opinions, but she only did that. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2345.76s)]
*  And I mean, man, this one woman and I think she's my age-ish, like unearthed all this [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2349.28s)]
*  information that was like, no, no one else got it except her because she was just so [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2356.3199999999997s)]
*  focused on this thing. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2360.08s)]
*  You know, it's great. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2361.4399999999996s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2363.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's exactly how the press is supposed to function. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2364.3199999999997s)]
*  They're not supposed to be credentialed. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2367.9599999999996s)]
*  Like, it's not supposed to be a thing where, you know, somebody confers a title. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2369.52s)]
*  You are the official media. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2374.2s)]
*  No, the citizen, like that's part of our job is to be the press, right? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2376.4399999999996s)]
*  Like that's why the first amendment was designed for exactly for that to happen. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2382.16s)]
*  And there were there was lots of incredible reporting that was done by either individuals [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2387.48s)]
*  or small, you know, organizations like the U.S. Right to Know. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2395.2s)]
*  They filed hundreds of FOIA requests on Fauci and gain of function and everything. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2400.56s)]
*  They really started the ball rolling on that whole side of that investigation. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2407.8s)]
*  It's, you know, it's a relatively small site. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2412.04s)]
*  And they had good, good young reporters there who were hungry. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2415.32s)]
*  And that's how this thing works. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2418.08s)]
*  You know, amazing, right? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2419.28s)]
*  Amazing. It's exciting. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2421.52s)]
*  It's so exciting. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2423.6s)]
*  And it's also true that there are increasingly people making like a legit living and getting rich, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2425.4s)]
*  but like paying the bills, doing this job. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2432.12s)]
*  Right. And is important. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2435.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's also how it's supposed to work. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2437.08s)]
*  I mean, I remember hearing a story about I.F. Stone when I was starting on Substack. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2439.64s)]
*  I was calling around to some of the old timers and saying, like, is this a good idea for me to tap out of mainstream media? [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2446.72s)]
*  And they told me a story that they said, you know, I.F. Stone cranked out a newsletter for those people who don't know. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2453.6s)]
*  He was a Izzy Stone. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2460.16s)]
*  He was a, you know, one of the original independent investigative journalists. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2462.08s)]
*  He worked out of his house. He put out this little newsletter, the I.F. Stone Weekly. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2467.92s)]
*  It was great reporting, independent, didn't have to answer to editors who told him to shape things one way or the other. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2472.44s)]
*  And he made a nice living, got himself a nice little house. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2479.52s)]
*  And that was enough. Right. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2483.52s)]
*  And he had an impact. And you can do that now. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2485.8s)]
*  The Internet makes it easier, actually. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2488.6s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2490.6s)]
*  Yeah. In America, we do things a little differently and we always have. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2491.7999999999997s)]
*  But the British said, hey, we're going to tax your favorite morning beverage. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2496.0s)]
*  The Revolutionary Sons of Liberty said no. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2500.2s)]
*  And they poured the entire shipment of tea into Boston Harbor and created a new country, a country based on personal choice and freedom. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2502.72s)]
*  Well, two hundred and fifty one years later, it is time to throw something else overboard. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2511.7599999999998s)]
*  Your overpriced big wireless contract. You don't need it. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2516.24s)]
*  You need to pay $100 a month just to get a free phone. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2520.2s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2524.12s)]
*  The cell phone company we use, Pure Talk, says no to all of this inflated prices, the BS, the contracts you can't understand, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2526.08s)]
*  and instead gives you service that you need, that you actually need. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2534.24s)]
*  With Pure Talk, it's super straightforward. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2537.3599999999997s)]

*  So you get everything and you know exactly what it is. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2553.0s)]
*  It's not designed to deceive you. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2555.7599999999998s)]
*  We strongly recommend it. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2558.56s)]
*  Pure Talk provides the same coverage as the other guys. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2559.68s)]
*  It's just a lot more affordable and a lot more straightforward. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2563.24s)]
*  You can find out for yourself. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2567.24s)]
*  Visit pure talk dot com slash Tucker. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2568.2799999999997s)]
*  Make the switch today. Pure Talk, America's wireless company. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2570.8399999999997s)]
*  You wonder again, I'm delaying you in your narrative once more with apologies, but you wonder even just the four topics you've [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2574.84s)]
*  mentioned so far are so big that if we got the truth or some higher percentage of the truth about those things, you wonder about [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2582.64s)]
*  the social effect. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2591.7599999999998s)]
*  So one of the things the censors always say is they're doing this or preventing you from knowing certain things to preserve [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2593.48s)]
*  societal stability. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2598.88s)]
*  Yeah, and trust in institutions. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2600.48s)]
*  Trust in institutions. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2601.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2603.12s)]
*  Trust in institutions. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2603.6s)]
*  So I mean, that's already gone away, but it will evaporate completely the more we know, don't you think? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2605.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2612.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2613.3199999999997s)]
*  But it'll be like, I mean, hopefully it'll be like the church committee hearings where, look, we just have to accept people are [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2613.6s)]
*  going to have their minds blown by discoveries, revelations. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2622.3199999999997s)]
*  For instance, it's already starting in the news media. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2628.4s)]
*  We're starting to get stories from journalists who are told they had to suppress certain angles, right? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2631.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, there was a Politico story about some people who were told to stay away from the the Hunter Biden laptop story. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2638.08s)]
*  Two Politico reporters having left Politico admitted that Politico, which is supposedly covering Washington, told them, no, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2645.68s)]
*  we're not we're not doing that. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2653.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2654.08s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2654.56s)]
*  And, you know, my first question is, why didn't you say that when it happened? [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2655.2799999999997s)]
*  But I guess people have jobs, right? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2659.52s)]
*  So that's that's a thing. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2661.16s)]
*  But there are going to be a lot more of those. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2663.56s)]
*  I mean, there are already kind of whispers going around. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2665.4799999999996s)]
*  But people are going to learn that institutions they believed in their whole lives were fraudulent, that they lied to them about [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  important things. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2680.3599999999997s)]
*  And it's going to be difficult at first, especially since there are not solid new institutions in place to replace them. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2681.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2691.88s)]
*  You know, it's one thing if you're taking down the CIA in the 70s and there's a supposedly reformed CIA there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2692.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2700.32s)]
*  This is different. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2702.36s)]
*  The media is going to have to rebuild itself from the ground up. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2703.6s)]
*  I think it's already doing great, but it doesn't have that look for a lot of people. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2706.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2712.36s)]
*  That's right. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2712.56s)]
*  And it looks very different. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2713.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2714.32s)]
*  And so, you know, it's going to be as you. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2714.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2717.0s)]
*  I think that's a good point. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2717.4s)]
*  It's a transitional period for people. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2718.2s)]
*  I guess. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2720.2s)]
*  Look, if you want trust in institutions, and I definitely do, I do. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2721.96s)]
*  I grew up trusting institutions. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2726.72s)]
*  I don't now. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2728.2799999999997s)]
*  That's their fault, not mine. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2729.16s)]
*  I think your country doesn't work if nobody trusts any of the institutions. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2731.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2734.32s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2734.64s)]
*  So we want that. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2735.16s)]
*  The only way to that is through transparency, honesty. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  So I get all that and I'm for it vehemently. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2740.96s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is the people who've been administering the system and benefiting [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2744.24s)]
*  from it are completely freaked out. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2749.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2752.32s)]
*  That's why they're trying to stop Tulsi. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2752.52s)]
*  But I wonder if they get threatened enough, if they don't become like just flat out [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2754.68s)]
*  dangerous to everybody else. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2759.92s)]
*  Like the only way to stop disclosure at this point would, would be with like a [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2761.48s)]
*  catastrophe that's so all encompassing 9 11 COVID that it just, everything shuts [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2765.4s)]
*  down. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2770.84s)]
*  All trends in progress stop. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2771.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2773.64s)]
*  And I just feel like there's a lot at stake for these people. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2773.84s)]
*  If you're, you know, John Brennan or Jim Clapper and you're like a criminal or Mike [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2775.96s)]
*  Pompeo, you're a criminal. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2780.1600000000003s)]
*  That's my opinion, but I think they're obviously criminals. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2782.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, you know, you've got a lot to lose. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2784.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2788.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2788.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2789.7200000000003s)]
*  And people in the intelligence agencies whose names are not known to the public, they're [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2790.3199999999997s)]
*  about to be. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2796.16s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2797.52s)]
*  And, you know, that we don't know what that's going to result in. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2798.48s)]
*  What impact that's going to have. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2805.24s)]
*  So this was my thinking about, you know, the period between the election and the [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2806.7599999999998s)]
*  inauguration this week. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2811.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that's one of the reasons that Tony Blinken was pushing so hard for a real war [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2814.52s)]
*  trying to kill Putin, for example, which the Biden administration did. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2819.6s)]
*  They tried to kill Putin. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2822.12s)]
*  Really? [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2823.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2823.56s)]
*  Yes, they did. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2824.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2824.7999999999997s)]
*  Which is insane. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2825.7599999999998s)]
*  I feel like, okay, so who takes over Russia? [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2826.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2829.04s)]
*  And what happens to the nuclear arsenal in a country that's like so complex, outsiders [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2829.52s)]
*  can't even understand. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2834.64s)]
*  I mean, you live there, you know, that's demented that you would even think of [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2835.2799999999997s)]
*  something like that. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2839.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2839.8399999999997s)]
*  So why were they? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2840.36s)]
*  Because chaos is a screen that protects them. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2841.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, I don't know this. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2844.48s)]
*  That's just like watching what they're doing. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2845.44s)]
*  I'm like, why would they be doing that? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2847.04s)]
*  Part of it is because like, it's like when you're taking off the roof of the embassy [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2848.68s)]
*  in Saigon, you burn all the papers, right? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2852.52s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2854.44s)]
*  But they can't because they're digital. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2855.08s)]
*  So maybe you need like a war to hide your tracks. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2856.3999999999996s)]
*  Or to keep the public's attention elsewhere. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2859.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2862.6s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2862.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2864.3199999999997s)]
*  I had the same fears and that was part of my thinking when they started approving the [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2864.68s)]
*  firing of American missiles into Russian territory and British missiles and French [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2871.6s)]
*  missiles. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2876.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm like, why would you do like, what possible reason would there be to do this? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2876.84s)]
*  You're not really going to make any military gains by doing this. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2883.32s)]
*  So it's you're doing it either to provoke the other side or to create a headline. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2887.1600000000003s)]
*  The headline, I don't think it gets you anything. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2892.96s)]
*  No. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2895.5600000000004s)]
*  So what were they doing? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2895.84s)]
*  And, you know, if you're, if as you're saying, they were fiddling with regime [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2897.8s)]
*  change in the interim. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2903.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2905.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2906.44s)]
*  I think that was a fear that a lot of people had. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2906.8s)]
*  I didn't think that frankly that Trump would become president. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2909.4s)]
*  I thought, you know, for a variety of different reasons, I don't know exactly what could [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2914.08s)]
*  have happened to stop that. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2920.0s)]
*  But it was hard for me to accept that it did happen. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2922.6800000000003s)]
*  I was sitting about six feet away and I just thought, wow, I can't believe this has [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2927.2000000000003s)]
*  actually happened. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2930.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2931.36s)]
*  Up until the second he said the oath, I was like, man, you know, I mean, you just get [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2931.8399999999997s)]
*  superstitious or paranoid or whatever it is, having seen all the stuff. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2936.72s)]
*  And I was embarrassed to have those thoughts. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2940.56s)]
*  I agree. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2942.24s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2942.68s)]
*  I was like, wow, I'm becoming crazy. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2943.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2945.3599999999997s)]
*  But it's not totally crazy when you see the pattern. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2945.68s)]
*  So, but I guess my, the point I would make is it's like, we're not, the process has [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2948.04s)]
*  not unfolded fully yet. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2952.16s)]
*  So like, there's still a lot that we don't know disclosure is, as you've said, like [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2953.7599999999998s)]
*  imminent and that sets up an incentive for the people being exposed to do something [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2959.16s)]
*  really crazy. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2963.7599999999998s)]
*  It does. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2965.04s)]
*  But I think the moment has passed for, for the real, like there was a moment where [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2965.56s)]
*  they could have installed, you know, a European style regime to stop [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2974.12s)]
*  misinformation. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2982.7999999999997s)]
*  This is, this is the new trend, right? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2983.72s)]
*  Remember the, the hurricanes happened and immediately FEMA is talking about setting [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2985.24s)]
*  up an anti misinformation center, right? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2989.4799999999996s)]
*  It just happened in California. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2992.72s)]
*  So fucking crazy. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2994.3999999999996s)]
*  Right? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2995.56s)]
*  I mean, the fact that Gavin Newsom had time to try to come up with a state bureau for [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=2996.16s)]
*  protecting my reputation. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3004.9599999999996s)]
*  But, but they could really have done that. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3007.9599999999996s)]
*  They could have basically put a net over everything with, I mean, that, that's the [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3012.12s)]
*  thing that's scary about the, the European situation is, is they already have that [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3018.56s)]
*  massive infrastructure in place to completely control the flow of information, what [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3023.7599999999998s)]
*  people see, what people don't see that they can punish people who step out of line. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3030.08s)]
*  And we were, you know, this far away from being part of something like that. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3034.56s)]
*  And if they were going to do that, if they had done that, and I think there, there was [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3040.52s)]
*  probably some thinking that that would have been accomplished by 2024. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3045.4s)]
*  If you go back and look at some of the European unions papers on the subject, they were [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3049.6400000000003s)]
*  anticipating that we were going to be signatories to certain agreements, like the code of [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3055.04s)]
*  practice on disinformation, that we would have our own version by now. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3060.6400000000003s)]
*  If they had done that, then none of this would be possible. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3064.36s)]
*  You know, all these independent outlets, they could scream to high heavens, but no [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3068.08s)]
*  one would see it. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3072.6s)]
*  It would be like, you know, it's totally right. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3073.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3075.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, you, you know, this because you, when you were doing shows about COVID, well, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3075.96s)]
*  now we can look behind the scenes and see that the White House was demanding that [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3081.92s)]
*  Facebook dial it down. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3085.48s)]
*  They turned it down to 50%. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3087.44s)]
*  I mean, that's in print. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3089.32s)]
*  I mean, what did you think when you saw that, by the way, when? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3091.2400000000002s)]
*  Totally ignored it. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3094.44s)]
*  I ignore all coverage that in any way pertains to me. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3096.16s)]
*  I don't want to become self-conscious. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3099.0s)]
*  So I didn't spend, you know, one second thinking about it. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3100.52s)]
*  I've had a couple other things and one other thing, particularly in the last year that [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3104.92s)]
*  was like so shocking. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3108.2400000000002s)]
*  I never thought about it again because you just don't. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3109.64s)]
*  I'm sure you've been through this. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3113.76s)]
*  I mean, you were speaking of mistreated. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3115.44s)]
*  I'm not going to bring it up, but you were identified as disobedient and I mean, they [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3117.64s)]
*  tried to end you. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3122.08s)]
*  I watched it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3123.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3124.6s)]
*  So you shrug it off or whatever, but you shrug it off. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3124.92s)]
*  But from my perspective, it's always you see things clearly when you look at someone [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3127.12s)]
*  else's life. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3130.12s)]
*  Sure. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3130.7200000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3131.52s)]
*  I didn't even know you at the time. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3132.08s)]
*  I was like, why are they trying to kill this guy? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3133.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3136.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3136.6s)]
*  Well, they were. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3136.96s)]
*  And that's my interpretation of it anyway. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3137.8s)]
*  But you can't brood on it. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3141.44s)]
*  No, but the fact that the mechanics, they were trying to install the mechanisms by [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3143.92s)]
*  which all this stuff would have been locked down. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3152.52s)]
*  And we saw during the COVID period how effective it was. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3155.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3160.12s)]
*  I mean, look, the new head of the NIH, Jay Bhattacharya, mostly didn't hear about his [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3160.96s)]
*  research, right? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3169.92s)]
*  I mean, this is the guy who. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3170.72s)]
*  Can you believe Jay Bhattacharya, who I love, thoroughly decent man, by the way, in addition [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3172.84s)]
*  to being right on the science, but he's a decent guy. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3178.08s)]
*  He's like the sweetest guy in the world. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3180.52s)]
*  I know. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3182.3599999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3182.64s)]
*  He's the head of NIH? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3183.08s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3184.08s)]
*  Isn't that amazing? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3185.0s)]
*  Kidding. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3186.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3187.2s)]
*  He goes from being censored to being the head of NIH. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3187.8399999999997s)]
*  It's an amazing transition. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3191.64s)]
*  But the thing that's so extraordinary about it is America would have had a completely [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3193.44s)]
*  different idea about lockdowns if they had understood how infectious the disease was, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3199.6s)]
*  how fruitless it was to try to physically prevent people from getting infected, and [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3206.7999999999997s)]
*  how unlikely that was to succeed and how compared to all the other negatives that could have [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3217.12s)]
*  happened from keeping people at home and everything like that. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3224.4s)]
*  Like they wouldn't have made that decision going forward, but they were able to effectively [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3226.7999999999997s)]
*  suppress that point of view, which is really scary, right? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3231.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, there was real research out there and most people didn't see it. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3236.24s)]
*  I didn't see it until a year and a half later. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3239.52s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3241.6s)]
*  Right? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3242.08s)]
*  No. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3242.64s)]
*  So, and that's what could have happened with all this stuff. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3242.96s)]
*  So, I know that you, without getting too specific, but you're in touch with doctors, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3248.96s)]
*  like on a personal level, like you know doctors, just practicing, you know, clinical physicians, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3255.04s)]
*  right? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3260.16s)]
*  My wife's the doctor. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3260.3199999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3261.7599999999998s)]
*  I didn't know if you wanted to say that. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3262.0s)]
*  You're married to a doctor. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3263.2s)]
*  So, did they know, like they, it was kept from them too, like they didn't. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3264.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3269.52s)]
*  Your average like emergency room physician was like aware that a lot of the COVID propaganda was fake. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3270.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I know some ER doctors as well, and they had to go looking for information. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3276.0s)]
*  And it was very hard to find. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3284.7999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, to this day, if you go on Google and you go looking for things, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3286.48s)]
*  you're not likely to find the sort of counter narrative thing easily. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3292.72s)]
*  And I think for a lot of doctors during that period, it was frustrating because [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3299.3599999999997s)]
*  even peer reviewed research was not always easy to find for them. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3304.16s)]
*  So, yeah, during that period, it affected the whole question of like [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3309.8399999999997s)]
*  experts who talked to the press, like they weren't always informed about what was going on, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3316.3199999999997s)]
*  or about different studies that had been done. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3322.72s)]
*  And yeah, we had a completely different idea about the pandemic than maybe we should have. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3325.2s)]
*  The point being is not so much that that was destructive in itself, though I think it was, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3331.7599999999998s)]
*  but that it was a proof of concept of something that was to come, you know. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3337.68s)]
*  Do you think that as we unearth more about COVID that the biggest question of all, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3343.04s)]
*  which was what was the point of that? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3347.2s)]
*  Clearly, it was a point. I mean, if every part of the society was coordinated and aimed toward the [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3349.2s)]
*  same goal, which was increasing the fear, preserving the lies about its origin, hiding a lot of stuff, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3354.64s)]
*  and like telling you and pushing you toward the vaccine. So like, and it was utterly coordinated. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3363.44s)]
*  If anyone was coordinated, that was from the churches to the schools to the media, everything, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3368.56s)]
*  everyone's in the same picture. Like, why? I don't know. I mean, that's what we have to [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3373.92s)]
*  that's why these documents will be so fascinating to get. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3379.3599999999997s)]
*  Do you think that we'll ever get to that we'll ever be able to say with some certainty or [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3381.92s)]
*  confidence like this is why they did that? We may not know some of the higher level [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3386.4s)]
*  thinking about things. I mean, you're probably not going to get a document that says, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3394.0s)]
*  look, it's really important that we do this because if we really stress masking, then we'll [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3399.92s)]
*  have established the precedent of that visible symbols of conformity are, you know, a positive [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3406.64s)]
*  goal for an authoritarian regime. I mean, they're not going to have that on paper anywhere, right? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  Yes. But there might be emails back and forth about how we get people to [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3417.68s)]
*  to follow instructions about how we manage the problem of academic freedom, right? [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3426.24s)]
*  There are probably going to be emails back and forth saying we have to change America's thinking [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3436.3999999999996s)]
*  about this and get them to start thinking more in the direction of trusting authority, right? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3440.64s)]
*  There's probably going to be some stuff about that because we've already seen that in, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3445.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, FOIA disclosures with some of these anti-disinformation groups and that's [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3450.0s)]
*  sort of thing. So I imagine there's going to be some stuff with the White House, the CDC, the NIH, [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3456.16s)]
*  there might be some things like that in there. But the higher level, sort of broader conspiratorial [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3463.6s)]
*  questions, I don't know what we're going to get, but I'm fascinated to find out. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3471.2799999999997s)]
*  Me too. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3475.04s)]
*  I want to tell you about an amazing documentary series from our friend Sean Stone called [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3475.52s)]
*  All the President's Men, the Conspiracy Against Trump. It is a series of interviews with people [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3481.12s)]
*  at the very heart of the first Trump term, many of whom are close to the heart of the second [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3486.4s)]
*  Trump term. This is their stories about what permanent Washington tried to do to them, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3492.56s)]
*  in many cases send them to prison, for the crime of supporting Donald Trump. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3497.68s)]
*  Their words have never been more relevant than they are now. Steve Bannon, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3501.2799999999997s)]
*  Cash Patel, I'm in there even. All the President's Men, the Conspiracy Against Trump, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3504.7999999999997s)]
*  and you will find it only on TCNTuckerCarlson.com. Highly recommended. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3509.36s)]
*  So, okay, so COVID. Next. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3522.32s)]
*  Okay, Russiagate? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3528.6400000000003s)]
*  Russiagate. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3530.48s)]
*  And the sort of related phenomenon of fake news, intelligence leaks designed to destroy careers, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3531.8399999999997s)]
*  which bleeds into kind of lawfare, right? But Russiagate specifically, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3540.8799999999997s)]
*  that's a big story. That's a place where I think that's going to be the easiest hit for [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3548.48s)]
*  investigators because we know where the documents are. In some cases, we even have them already. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3553.3599999999997s)]
*  They're redacted. So we get to look under the redactions now. Why did they start the [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3561.12s)]
*  original investigation? What was the impetus for the July 31st opening in 2016 of Crossfire [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3568.08s)]
*  Hurricane? There's some conflicting stories in the past. Did it really come from Britain? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3576.64s)]
*  Did John Brennan really advise the CIA to look into it? Or was it something else? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3584.24s)]
*  Why did the FBI open an investigation into Trump specifically after he had taken office [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3590.8799999999997s)]
*  in May of 2017? It's just an extraordinary thing. Thinking back to that time, we don't remember it, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3598.56s)]
*  but the FBI opened a probe into the sitting president of the United States [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3607.44s)]
*  to ask the question of whether he was working for a foreign power at that time. And what evidence [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3613.12s)]
*  could they have possibly had for that apart from the fact that he fired Jim Comey? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3619.52s)]
*  They had no evidence. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3626.64s)]
*  If there's nothing under those redactions more than that, then that itself is an extraordinary [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  scandal just by itself, right? So the predicate for all of this, I think, maybe even earlier, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3634.0s)]
*  but to my knowledge, late in the summer of 2016 with the hacking of the DNC and the emails from [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3639.52s)]
*  the DNC. And the FBI never investigated it, never investigated the actual, the physical removal of [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3648.08s)]
*  this data from their servers. Instead, a company called CrowdStrike, which worked for the Democratic [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3655.52s)]
*  Party did. And then exactly at that moment, or right around that moment, a DNC staffer was killed [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3660.08s)]
*  in Washington, DC in an apparent robbery in which nothing was taken from him that I happen to know [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3668.4s)]
*  for a fact the MPD, the Metropolitan Police Department thought was like bizarre. And they [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3673.6s)]
*  kind of didn't believe it. A Fox News host went on air and asked questions about this killing. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3677.92s)]
*  Why wouldn't you? And the parents of the man who was killed either sued or I think they sued, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3685.52s)]
*  they certainly threatened to sue and basically scared the crap out of everyone. So no one's [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3691.52s)]
*  ever asked a question about it since. They hired a private investigator who looked around. In that [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3695.04s)]
*  case, I remember and there were some odd details there. The FBI ended up in possession of his laptop. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3701.28s)]
*  Why would the FBI wind up in, I mean, this is a local crime, right? [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3712.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. This was one of the first reasons I started to look at that case because I got a call from [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3717.2000000000003s)]
*  somebody about that. And I don't know why that was the case, but it is the case. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3722.48s)]
*  And there were people at the DNC, one of whom I know, who thought that he was murdered for [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3732.1600000000003s)]
*  political reasons at the DNC. A very high ranking person at the DNC told me that. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3737.28s)]
*  And I probably should just say, but everyone can guess who it is who's informed on this, but I don't [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3743.0400000000004s)]
*  want to betray confidence, but I'm not making this up. And I don't know what happened, but like, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3747.6800000000003s)]
*  as far as I know, not one person has looked into that in the media. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3753.36s)]
*  Yeah. No, and even if it is just an unsolved murder of a type that they normally solve, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3756.32s)]
*  the whole situation, that whole timeline was very strange. It doesn't really make sense. The [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3768.2400000000002s)]
*  hacking of the DNC, the bringing in of CrowdStrike, when the information was released [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3776.0800000000004s)]
*  online, they never really proved that case, but they immediately made inferences about it. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3785.28s)]
*  And there was an incredibly sophisticated kind of public campaign to create this narrative that [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3791.2000000000003s)]
*  upon closer examination, it turns out not to be true. So we got to go back and find out what did [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3799.28s)]
*  exactly happen there. Why did they order this crossfire hurricane probe? Why were they sending [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3806.2400000000002s)]
*  informants in after Trump or people in his orbit? And we know they did. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3813.28s)]
*  And who were all those informants? It'd be interesting. I have some suspicions. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3820.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Well, we know who some of them were, right? But we don't know who all of them were. I mean, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3824.5600000000004s)]
*  I did a story to the effect that the people in the House Intelligence Committee who were looking at [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3830.32s)]
*  this, Cash Patel's initial probe, they came up with a number that it was 26 different people who [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3836.64s)]
*  were being investigated in Trump's orbit. No matter what happened, it's a huge story because [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3845.12s)]
*  it's the political espionage story. It's not unlike Watergate, really. And we've laughed it off, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3854.08s)]
*  or the mainstream press has shrugged and snorted at the idea that this is a scandal that needs to be [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3862.3199999999997s)]
*  taken seriously. But it does. It absolutely does. Just because it's Donald Trump doesn't [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3869.7599999999998s)]
*  mean you can ignore the FBI conducting political investigations, willy-nilly and inventing [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3875.04s)]
*  predicates to look into people's campaigns and using FISA and all kinds of other crazy [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3883.12s)]
*  crazy... Can I say crazy shit? Yeah. I mean, that stuff was all nuts. And we need to find out [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3891.12s)]
*  exactly what happened with that. And that is one of the reasons I think that people are [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3897.6s)]
*  nervous about this weaponization of government probe, because it's absolutely going to look in [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3903.36s)]
*  that direction. Yes. And that's one of the first things they're going to look at is, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3908.32s)]
*  who was behind that? Who cooked up the Steele dossier? How was that released? [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3914.96s)]
*  And then there's the whole question of leading up to impeachment and the leaks that were done. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3925.12s)]
*  A lot of them were kind of illegal on their face, right? Like you can't leak signals, intelligence to [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3934.16s)]
*  newspapers. And it was done repeatedly during that time period. It happened to me. They did it to me. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3939.76s)]
*  Right. Yeah, exactly. The NSA read my text and leaked them to the New York Times twice. Right. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3943.44s)]
*  Yeah. And they admitted it one time, but it was under FISA. So it was like... [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3949.76s)]
*  Which is, by the way, hilarious because initially they were denying that it even happened, right? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3956.4s)]
*  And then of course later it turns out there was more advantageous to leak the contents. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3965.12s)]
*  So, but people had developed, they developed very short memories during this time period. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3971.36s)]
*  They were not able to retain information among other things because journalists got out of the [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3975.92s)]
*  habit of repeating the story. That was one of the things that we were taught. When I was taught [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3980.8s)]
*  growing up, when you're doing a story about anything, you have to recount all of the facts [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3987.84s)]
*  as if the reader has never encountered the story before. Each story should stand alone. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=3993.76s)]
*  Yes, exactly. You have to retell the whole thing so that they don't have to go looking for another [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4000.08s)]
*  story to find out what this means. Exactly. And one of the subtle little changes that happened [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4004.7999999999997s)]
*  to the media business in the last eight years is they stopped doing that. They would tell you... [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4012.72s)]
*  That's fascinating. Right? They would tell you the thing that happened that day [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4018.24s)]
*  and they wouldn't tell you all this backstory that you needed to know to really understand [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4021.84s)]
*  what you were reading. And so, yeah, I think we're going to have the opportunity now to see these [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4026.7999999999997s)]
*  things laid out in full and in hindsight and that's hopefully going to be able to persuade [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4035.04s)]
*  people who didn't see it the first time. That's such a fascinating observation, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4042.72s)]
*  which I've never heard before or thought of. But isn't it true? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4047.7599999999998s)]
*  It's so true. It's so true. And so everything's out of context. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4050.56s)]
*  Right. Yeah. There's a certain element of dot connecting required in journalism. Like, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4055.2s)]
*  why am I telling you this? Why does it matter? How does it connect to things that happen, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4060.24s)]
*  other things that happened or may happen? Even simple things like when... [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4063.9199999999996s)]
*  If Anthony Fauci comes out and says, well, masks are important because of X, well, you have to put in [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4071.8399999999997s)]
*  the timeline of what he originally said about that. Or Joe Biden saying, we have to [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4079.12s)]
*  correct misinformation because they're killing people. And you've got to point out that they [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4090.08s)]
*  were wrong about things themselves or that the Biden administration itself was deamplified [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4093.9199999999996s)]
*  by some of these platforms accidentally, but they were, right? But yeah, they just left out [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4101.28s)]
*  a lot of backstory and we have to get back into the business of telling people the whole story [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4109.679999999999s)]
*  from the beginning. Fascinating. Okay. So... [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4114.799999999999s)]
*  Russiagate. Russiagate. And that's one of the reasons why the pardon of Adam Schiff is kind [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4120.4s)]
*  of interesting because he's a central figure of both the J6 committee, but also the Russiagate [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4126.96s)]
*  story. And he was somebody who was giving interviews saying that preemptive pardons should [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4136.64s)]
*  never be given, but whatever. Yeah. Russiagate is a thing. Then there's the whole question of [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4141.84s)]
*  lawfare, right? And the effort to make sure that Biden faced no opposition at all in his re-election [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4149.92s)]
*  campaign. And here I'm not just talking about Donald Trump and the lawsuit to prevent him from [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4160.4800000000005s)]
*  being on the ballot because of the Fourth Amendment and all that. This extends to even to groups like [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4168.400000000001s)]
*  No Labels or the Green Party or Dean Phillips or Marianne Williamson or Cornell West. There was [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4175.04s)]
*  an extraordinary calculated effort to prevent competition. Now, that's not necessarily illegal. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4182.8s)]
*  Parties can do whatever they want internally, but it's still fascinating that there had to have been [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4191.68s)]
*  some kind of coordinated campaign. If there's any communication between the White House, say, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4200.64s)]
*  and the groups that were suing No Labels or RFK or issuing challenges, No Labels went through this [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4206.64s)]
*  extraordinary incident where somebody created a dummy No Labels site and it had a big picture of [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4218.240000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump on it so that it would try to associate No Labels with Trump. And there's a lawsuit [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4227.52s)]
*  going on about it right now. What was the real origin of that? Who financed that whole thing? [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4234.64s)]
*  I think there are a lot of stories about little tiny dirty tricks that are going to be coming out. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4242.64s)]
*  Well, it also, the main question was who makes these decisions? So if the Democratic Party is [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4248.4800000000005s)]
*  running the United States, which they have for four years, I think we can say that. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4253.4400000000005s)]
*  What does that mean? Who's running the Democratic Party? I would imagine it's a coalition of [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4256.88s)]
*  elected officials, Chuck Schumer, big fundraisers, Jeffrey Kassenberg, and Obama, I guess. But who [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4263.84s)]
*  really is running this? Who's on the central committee? Right. And how is that done? How was [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4277.599999999999s)]
*  the coordination managed with these sort of legal action committees that were mass filing suits [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4283.84s)]
*  about everything from the ballot access issue to there were Klan Act suits that were filed [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4290.8s)]
*  against people? Did that have any connection to people who are actually in office? If it did, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4297.4400000000005s)]
*  then we have another corruption situation involved. But yeah, the larger question of who [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4305.28s)]
*  was managing all this stuff, because it clearly wasn't Joe Biden. Right, who runs the country? [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4312.0s)]
*  Who runs the country? In a democracy, we have a right to know. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4318.4s)]
*  Right. Our mutual friend, Walter Kern, talked about this saying that this was the first time [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4322.719999999999s)]
*  that we had a president that had a sign on his desk basically that said, the buck does not stop [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4330.32s)]
*  here. We don't know where the buck stopped during this period. And so that's a fascinating [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4336.56s)]
*  question. But the whole war gaming of the last election season, there are a lot of stories, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4344.080000000001s)]
*  people don't even remember this, like New Hampshire held a primary, right? People went and they voted [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4350.64s)]
*  in the New Hampshire primary. And then the results were canceled and they held a second [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4357.120000000001s)]
*  nominating event on a Saturday night, months later, where a bunch of officials got together [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4362.96s)]
*  and they just decided to allocate the delegates themselves. Like I'd never heard of that before, [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4370.0s)]
*  just canceling an election and just sort of redoing it in a closed meeting. Like, how does [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4377.2s)]
*  that happen? And just turning the spoils over to somebody else? I mean, I think it ended up mostly [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4382.64s)]
*  having the same result, but for some reason they held the second contest. It's just very strange [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4388.32s)]
*  why that happened. So that we got to get into. Then there's the whole question of the investigation [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4395.28s)]
*  of the Trump assassination incidents. We heard nothing about that. It was the most extraordinary [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4406.639999999999s)]
*  news story that I've ever, apart from the disappearing president and the mysterious nomination [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4411.92s)]
*  and COVID, presidential candidate and ex-president gets shot and the story's dead within like 48 [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4417.36s)]
*  hours. And all you read in the news from the FBI, there were these comments saying that they don't [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4425.76s)]
*  have any motive evidence. We've done a hundred interviews, we've done a hundred interviews, [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4433.28s)]
*  but we don't know anything about why this happened or what was going on there. Do you believe that? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4438.32s)]
*  I have a very hard time believing that there's nothing interesting in the- [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4445.759999999999s)]
*  He was kind of your classic 20 year old American kid with no social media presence whatsoever ever. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4449.2s)]
*  Right, yes exactly. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4454.639999999999s)]
*  It is a very typical American story where Wendy just wake up and decide to die assassinating a [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4457.679999999999s)]
*  presidential candidate and then she's like, oh, I'm going to die. And then she's like, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4463.04s)]
*  I'm going to die assassinating a presidential candidate for no reason. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4466.88s)]
*  Right, it's like your first joint. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4469.28s)]
*  Your first joint. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4472.32s)]
*  Yeah. And then the second one, I mean, the Ryan Routh thing, that's not weird at all. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4476.400000000001s)]
*  I just flew into Florida last night. I don't think I could have gotten my hands on a Chinese made [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4486.72s)]
*  SKS semi-automatic rifle without help. I mean, I don't know. That's being a little [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4493.92s)]
*  conspiratorial, but look, there are a lot of- [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4500.639999999999s)]
*  Well, he met with the members of Congress. He was lived in Ukraine. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4502.48s)]
*  What? And we know that our intelligence is working through the Ukrainian intelligence. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4507.12s)]
*  He's had murdered all these people and tried to murder all these people, including some I know [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4512.5599999999995s)]
*  personally. And so that's a fact. And he was there with them, but this had nothing to do. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4515.6s)]
*  And by the way, are those the only two attempts on Donald Trump's life, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4524.72s)]
*  do you think, during this campaign season? I don't think so. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4527.200000000001s)]
*  So why don't we know more about that? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4530.08s)]
*  I don't know why we don't know more about that. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4531.68s)]
*  Yeah, right. So I mean, I've talked to the Trump people and Trump himself, and I'm being sincere. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4533.6s)]
*  I really don't have a sense of what they think of all of that. I know that in public, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4542.32s)]
*  they haven't been anxious to talk about it at all. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4546.4s)]
*  So I've talked to some of them and I've heard a lot of anger about this. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4549.28s)]
*  And I think this is the impetus for these investigations. I think probably the second [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4560.719999999999s)]
*  attempt was the last straw for some of the people on his staff. And it's part of the reason why I [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4565.36s)]
*  think they're going to be very public about this. It can't come too soon, I really think. And [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4575.599999999999s)]
*  I will say, whatever people watching think of Trump, I know for a dead certain fact that a lot [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4582.88s)]
*  of people who work for him really like him personally. So I think they are mad about it. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4586.799999999999s)]
*  They're very mad about it. And then, sorry, just to finish off the censorship thing, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4591.68s)]
*  that is going to be a major investigation. There's at least two that I know of that are [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4601.280000000001s)]
*  already underway. The Government Affairs, the Rand Paul's Committee, Government Oversight Committee [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4607.76s)]
*  in the Senate, they really want to do a big thing like a government files type of thing where [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4615.52s)]
*  it would be like the Twitter files, but for the whole federal government, basically. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4622.96s)]
*  And I think there are so many different wings of the government that were involved [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4626.8s)]
*  in what we got to see in the Twitter files, which to follow the example of what I just said, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4635.12s)]
*  I have to repeat what this is. When Elon Musk bought Twitter, he opened up Twitter, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4641.68s)]
*  Twitter's internal correspondence, and we got to see that there was this big bureaucracy with [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4647.280000000001s)]
*  government pressuring platforms like Twitter and Facebook to censor content. But we only got to see [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4653.4400000000005s)]
*  a little bit of it. And I think what's going to come out is how extensive it really was, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4659.12s)]
*  what agencies were really involved in it, how many people were committed to that effort. Also, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4666.56s)]
*  were we negotiating with the European Union to be part of the Digital Services Act? [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4678.0s)]
*  Was the State Department doing that? So there's going to be a big- [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4686.64s)]
*  People who haven't followed it, can you just describe the Digital Services Act? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4691.52s)]
*  The Digital Services Act is like the wet dream of every censor in the world. Basically, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4694.64s)]
*  it mandates that every internet platform abide by the recommendations of these [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4700.88s)]
*  people called trusted flaggers, who are basically licensed content reviewers who look at things on [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4708.8s)]
*  social media. And if they see a narrative that they don't like, they will elevate it to the [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4717.280000000001s)]
*  platform. If the platform does not abide by the recommendations, they get crippling enormous fines. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4723.44s)]
*  And this is one of the reasons why there was a dispute between Elon Musk and Europe about whether [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4730.0s)]
*  or not he was following these rules closely enough. This just came into effect last year, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4738.08s)]
*  but it's an extremely effective way to regulate speech because it doesn't require the government [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4744.5599999999995s)]
*  to actually do it. It's the private platform that actually commits, of course, the censorship. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4753.5199999999995s)]
*  And this third-party methodology, which is specifically, by the way, what Donald Trump [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4759.12s)]
*  referenced in his free speech executive order, we don't want that to happen. We're going to [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4765.679999999999s)]
*  not allow that. They already have the full-blown Death Star version in Europe of that. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4772.08s)]
*  And so the investigation here in the United States is going to basically uncover how far along were we [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4779.04s)]
*  into developing the same kind of thing. The Twitter file suggests that we're already doing it [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4786.5599999999995s)]
*  informally and illegally, probably, but we want to find out exactly. We have Snopes and all the other [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4792.96s)]
*  fact-checkers. Yes, all the fact-checking organizations. Sometimes that was done [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4801.92s)]
*  informally by inference or it was done through NGOs that made recommendations. But I think the [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4808.64s)]
*  really dangerous stuff is when you had State Department agencies like the Global Engagement [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4816.88s)]
*  Center or the FBI's Foreign Influence Task Force making direct recommendations to these platforms [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4821.28s)]
*  or the White House, in your case, we're going to find out all these communications, not just [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4828.48s)]
*  little pieces of them. What about the U.S. government, the intel agencies' control of [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4834.24s)]
*  Wikipedia, which basically is our collective memory at this point? It's elevated by Google. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4839.839999999999s)]
*  It's the top of every search. It is the only history most people will ever read, and it's [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4845.36s)]
*  controlled by the U.S. government to disappear in convenient facts. Yeah, I mean, Wikipedia has [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4851.36s)]
*  a very advanced system for regulating what gets into Wikipedia pages. If it's not a certain kind [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4858.5599999999995s)]
*  of source, it doesn't get on there. There was a bizarre incident last year where the real clear [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4868.5599999999995s)]
*  politics, you know, polling average, which is a tool that reporters have been using for almost [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4874.719999999999s)]
*  two decades, they kind of left it off their page of polling average sites because they didn't like [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4881.92s)]
*  the page, I guess. I don't know. But yeah, I think we have to get some clarity about what happened [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4890.32s)]
*  there. Obviously, the former head of Wikipedia is now in a senior position in NPR. The deputy or the [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4896.32s)]
*  government media job to another. Yeah, exactly. And the COO of NPR is the former head of this thing [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4908.4800000000005s)]
*  called the Aspen Commission on Information Disorder, which is one of the groups that we [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4915.6s)]
*  investigated in the Twitter files was sort of heavily into this whole content moderation [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4919.52s)]
*  question. So the merging of state media with platforms and regulation of [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4925.360000000001s)]
*  sourcing and all that stuff, that's probably going to come out too. Kind of weird that the head of [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4932.400000000001s)]
*  the Aspen Institute wrote the biography of Elon Musk, isn't it? Right. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4936.72s)]
*  Walter Pinkus, right? Isaacson. Isaacson. Sorry. Walter Pinkus was the CIA reporter at the [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4942.8s)]
*  Washington Post. Can you cut that? No, no, no, it's just funny. You remember Walter Pinkus. Yeah, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4947.6s)]
*  Walter Askson. Yeah. Yeah, no, it is weird. The Aspen Institute, I mean, they played a very strange [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4952.88s)]
*  role in the whole censorship story. But, but yeah. So what happens to the, you said the media [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4959.6s)]
*  as constituted is dead. But I mean, like the Episcopal Church, like they have enormous, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4966.56s)]
*  like shells left, you know what I mean? Like the churches died, but the, they've got great churches, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4972.96s)]
*  right? Buildings. What do you, what happens to like the Washington Post and NBC News? [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4978.88s)]
*  There's still those bureaus and CNN and like, what, what happens to these things? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4983.280000000001s)]
*  They're going to struggle, I think, to get audience back. You already see that the strategy [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4989.36s)]
*  of some of them is to try to pander to the audiences that they betrayed previously. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=4996.96s)]
*  Yeah, there was a funny episode over last weekend where NBC and Saturday Night Live, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5005.12s)]
*  you know, they finally did a joke picking on Rachel Maddow. It wasn't particularly funny, [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5011.92s)]
*  but it was a signal that, okay, we're going to suck up to this group now, right? As opposed to [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5018.08s)]
*  the other one, which is so loathsome, right? And that, but- [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5023.759999999999s)]
*  Rachel Maddow was not the core, whatever you think of Rachel Maddow, she just like [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5026.96s)]
*  advertises herself as Rachel Maddow, you know, one person's opinions. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5032.48s)]
*  That's funny. You sounded like her for a second there. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5036.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, I know her and I've never been mad at her. I couldn't disagree more. I know, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5038.0s)]
*  sure, she's attacked me a lot. I wouldn't know, but I'm not mad at Rachel Maddow. I'm mad at [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5042.32s)]
*  Ken Delaney and like, you know what I mean? People who pose as reporters who are actually just [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5047.12s)]
*  mouthpieces for the intel world. Of course. And my only point is that just by, you know, changing [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5052.08s)]
*  the direction of their BS, they're not going to win back audience, right? People, you know, [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5061.28s)]
*  and this is something that I've noticed since I've been in the business, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5069.12s)]
*  is people in media continually underestimate audiences. They think that they're much stupider [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5072.96s)]
*  than they really are. I remember when I covered Wall Street, I was constantly told that you [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5080.4s)]
*  can't do these big stories on credit default swaps and all these other things because audiences [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5088.08s)]
*  don't want to hear about it. They'll turn the page, but it's not true. People have a great hunger to [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5092.72s)]
*  find out things and they have a much stronger ability to understand things than most media [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5098.56s)]
*  people imagine. And so when they do these sort of transparent exercises in lying and PR and [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5104.8s)]
*  political propaganda, and they think that people won't notice, it makes it worse. The numbers are [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5114.4800000000005s)]
*  going to go down rather than up when they start. Totally true. Well, it's just interesting. I [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5121.200000000001s)]
*  actually think it's more sinister even than you described. So the two topics after 30 years in [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5125.6s)]
*  the television, the two topics that they never wanted to do, they always wanted to do stuff about [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5130.400000000001s)]
*  trannies or race or whatever, all that stuff, but they never want to do economics or foreign policy [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5135.92s)]
*  ever. And their view was, their stated view was the audience doesn't care. And then I get fired [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5141.360000000001s)]
*  and start doing foreign policy stuff and it gets crazy numbers. And I only do it purely because [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5149.200000000001s)]
*  I'm interested. That's it. I was always interested and I'm also interested in economics. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5153.36s)]
*  I'm not an expert, but I think it matters. That's why I'm interested, right? You do a story like that, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5156.639999999999s)]
*  you blow out of the water all the pap that they do. So it turns out there's a deep reservoir of [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5162.96s)]
*  interest among viewers and readers for these stories. And I'm starting to think that maybe [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5168.32s)]
*  the people who run the networks where I worked, they just didn't want to address that stuff [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5173.36s)]
*  because there was a consensus on it that they agreed with and that they didn't want to challenge. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5178.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5183.04s)]
*  You think so? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5183.6s)]
*  Oh, I, a hundred percent. I think that, I think that the, especially when you're talking about [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5184.16s)]
*  interventionist military policies, whether or not they've been effective, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5192.32s)]
*  try pitching stories to one of the big newspapers about maybe some kind of downside to [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5197.68s)]
*  an invasion or an occupation or the expansion of, you know, with a thousand military bases in the [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5206.4800000000005s)]
*  Middle East or whatever it is, drone warfare, like, you know, you're going to have a hard time [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5212.96s)]
*  selling that one, right? But they did it in the slyest way. I mean, it went right over my head [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5218.320000000001s)]
*  for decades. They did it not by saying, you know, we just don't agree, you know, we have one [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5224.08s)]
*  perspective on that and we're going to stick with it. That's a straightforward way to explain it, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5228.56s)]
*  which I can digest. They instead said, no, the audience just doesn't care. And you're basically [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5232.48s)]
*  putting the business at risk by covering things that people have no interest in. So get back to [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5236.719999999999s)]
*  Natalie Holloway or whatever the drama of the moment was. And I believed that. I believed it. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5241.12s)]
*  I mean, I just assume people just aren't interested. I guess I internalized the, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5247.919999999999s)]
*  our audience's dumb position, which they had for the whole time I worked there. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5251.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And it's, it's worse than TV than it is in print, but, but it shouldn't be, right? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5255.679999999999s)]
*  But I, and I got the same thing. I mean, not, not so much at Rolling Stone, but I remember [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5262.639999999999s)]
*  we did one story where our plan was to do one story on what caused the financial crisis. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5268.8s)]
*  And we got such an overwhelming response because it wasn't anywhere. People could not read anywhere [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5274.16s)]
*  what happened to the economy in 2008. There was not a rational explanation that people could read. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5281.92s)]
*  You did big, I guess, numbers is not applicable to a magazine, but that got, I mean, your stories [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5288.0s)]
*  on that were widely read because you're one of the only people doing it. Right. But it wasn't so much [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5294.5599999999995s)]
*  what I was doing. It was just, it was just the fact of, you know, how does this work? Who was [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5299.759999999999s)]
*  really profiting by it? What happened to the people who bought these homes, et cetera, et cetera, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5305.679999999999s)]
*  just basic questions. And people wanted to know. And as you discover, they want to know other [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5310.88s)]
*  things. Where are they spending the money that I send every year that goes to the Pentagon? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5316.96s)]
*  That's right. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5322.0s)]
*  Right. How is, how does it disappear into a black hole and it's not auditable and that's okay. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5322.64s)]
*  And I, you know, it's funny. I remember getting back in the summer, late August of 2001 from Maine. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5329.04s)]
*  I'd been in Maine and, you know, on just on vacation, going back to work and our, I was at [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5337.36s)]
*  CNN then and we were wall to wall, literally wall to wall on a story about a Congressman from [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5343.36s)]
*  Bakersfield, California, Kern County called Gary Condit. And the question was, did he murder his [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5349.44s)]
*  intern Chandra Levy? And then later, whatever, in case anyone cares, turns out she was killed by [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5355.12s)]
*  an illegal alien from El Salvador called Ingmar Gwendeke. He killed a couple other people, I think. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5360.48s)]
*  Anyway, whatever, that was the story. But at the time we were fully immersed in this question of, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5365.36s)]
*  is this moderate Democrat from Bakersfield a murderer? And I mean, we did specials on it. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5370.64s)]
*  It's all we did. And then that September, that was interrupted by 9-11. And I remember thinking at [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5376.56s)]
*  the time, like 9-11 came out of nowhere. There was no kind of backstories. It just happened. It was [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5383.52s)]
*  like truly like the least expected thing that ever happened. Right. Right. In retrospect, I think, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5388.56s)]
*  were there things going on in the world along bigger trends that maybe we should, you know, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5395.04s)]
*  as a news company, we should have been paying attention to? Sure. To kind of prepare people for [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5399.68s)]
*  at least the idea that like, wow, something bad could happen because there's a lot going on abroad. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5404.0s)]
*  Yeah. I think if you had visited parts of the Middle East back then, you would have- [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5409.04s)]
*  We had the coal bombing and then like the Saudis where we had bases in places that were clearly [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5413.280000000001s)]
*  very provocative for no real reason. There was- [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5418.400000000001s)]
*  The FATWA, the Kenyan bombing. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5420.96s)]
*  Yes. Exactly. There was a lot going on and we just kind of ignored all of it. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5423.200000000001s)]
*  But we didn't just ignore it. We ignored it like this manic way, like must cover Gary Condit. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5428.24s)]
*  And I'm not a conspiracy nut, Matt, but you do sort of wonder like, what was that? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5433.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Those were the good old days when the manias were things like the summer of the shark. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5439.679999999999s)]
*  Right. Remember that? [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5445.759999999999s)]
*  Do I remember? I think I participated in it. Should you swim? [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5447.44s)]
*  I should swim. But then you get 9-11 like this one, you know, sort of beautiful fall morning and [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5451.28s)]
*  everything changes. And it's like, I do think it's fair to ask, even if there's no intent involved, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5459.12s)]
*  like how did we, like what should we have done differently to at least give people the sense [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5464.08s)]
*  that there were highly organized, well-funded elements abroad that hated us? Like I just did [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5469.28s)]
*  not know that. And most people didn't. Yeah. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5474.48s)]
*  And it came- Why didn't we do that? Honestly. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5476.719999999999s)]
*  And it came as a shock to a lot of people. Like a complete shock. Were you in the country [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5479.52s)]
*  when that happened? No, I was in Russia. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5483.92s)]
*  And- Well, so at least you have that excuse, you know, you're living in another country. I lived [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5486.88s)]
*  in Washington, DC covering the news for CNN. I mean, I hosted a show on CNN and I had no idea that- [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5491.120000000001s)]
*  Like, that's a terrifying feeling, right? To be, you got to cover something that you have no [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5495.92s)]
*  background in. Well, there was no covering it. There was just watching it. Right. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5502.0s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. And there's never actually been any [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5505.52s)]
*  covering of it. No one's ever really covered 9-11. Like what was that? [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5507.52s)]
*  Yeah. Exactly. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5511.120000000001s)]
*  And what followed it. Yeah, exactly. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5513.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, I did cover that. But like the 9-11, like how exactly did that happen? We have all these [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5515.120000000001s)]
*  law enforcement and intelligence agencies protecting us and they had no idea that there [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5520.8s)]
*  are dozens and dozens and dozens of, you know, the 19 hijackers, but then all the support people [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5526.0s)]
*  living in our country, training, getting money from- We never really- What? Anyway, I don't know [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5531.68s)]
*  why I'm going off on that, but it's like no one ever asked the basic questions. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5539.52s)]
*  Right. Right. And, you know, there are a lot of people who didn't ask basic questions [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5543.84s)]
*  in the last eight years. I've noticed. Including me, I guess, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5551.2s)]
*  because a lot of the things you just said are like, yeah, whatever happened to that? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5555.2s)]
*  Well, it becomes overwhelming after a while. I mean, you know, the 50th time they tell you [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5559.2s)]
*  that democracy is going to end in 10 minutes or, you know, you're going to die if you don't, you [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5566.8s)]
*  know, take this medicine or whatever it is or, you know, your kids are going to die. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5571.92s)]
*  Emotionally, it wears on people and it becomes very difficult. I mean, I think this was a factor [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5578.320000000001s)]
*  in- It was a factor in a lot of the corruption stories because the audiences were not- [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5584.16s)]
*  They were not going to be receptive to alternative versions of what they had just heard because it [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5591.12s)]
*  was such an emotionally wrenching experience for them. So it's going to take a while for people [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5596.16s)]
*  to digest a lot of these things. You know, I think it's happening slowly, but what's going to be [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5602.24s)]
*  interesting about this period is that there's going to be this avalanche of primary material [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5610.16s)]
*  that's going to come out. And I'm fast. I can't wait. You're going to hire more staff to keep up [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5615.5199999999995s)]
*  with it all. Yeah, probably. Probably that's the case. And it's going to be a fun time for [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5622.639999999999s)]
*  journalists like me, but just as a citizen, I can't wait to read it, you know? So can I ask [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5628.8s)]
*  one last question of your reporting is marked by its command of detail, I would say. I mean, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5633.36s)]
*  it is. I read it. Hopefully. Yeah. No, but I've like a lot of detail, like a lot of detail. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5639.68s)]
*  And so you look at things, I kind of like, you know, I'm not a detail guy. You are. What name one [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5645.280000000001s)]
*  tiny detail that you are personally obsessed with and maybe mildly embarrassed to admit you're [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5654.240000000001s)]
*  obsessed with, but what's the one thing that you just, you want to know, that you've been [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5659.6s)]
*  wondering about? I mean, I think the thing that happened last year with that frenzied week in July [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5664.56s)]
*  with Biden and, you know, and the lying about the poll numbers and the phony, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5674.320000000001s)]
*  the clearly planted stories about Nancy Pelosi. The lying about the poll numbers? What? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5684.64s)]
*  Well, there were like, there were stories that Biden was ahead in the polls that came out as [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5690.959999999999s)]
*  they were telling us that he had to drop out because the poll numbers were so dire. NPR did [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5696.719999999999s)]
*  a story like virtually, I believe it was this a couple of days after the debate. I'll have to go [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5701.759999999999s)]
*  back and look at this. But there, but there were stories that he was doing fine in the polls. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5709.36s)]
*  And of course, we later found out from Biden staffers that they said they never had [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5714.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, that that was about Kamala. They never had internal polling showing Kamala ahead. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5721.28s)]
*  Even though there were scads of stories telling us the opposite, which is, but for me, the story [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5726.799999999999s)]
*  that I just can't get past is what happened in that one week. And how did they manufacture that [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5734.24s)]
*  whole thing without anybody showing any kind of curiosity about it? You know, had the media been [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5743.84s)]
*  so completely paper trained by that moment that they, I guess so, right? But, you know, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5751.28s)]
*  it's the same, but it's the same impulse that maintains discipline in Washington and in the [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5758.56s)]
*  media, which is commitment to party first. And what is so that is the one thing, like, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5764.24s)]
*  all the things I disagree with the Democratic Party and some of the Republican Party on policy, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5771.04s)]
*  like all kinds of disagreements, like I think that they think that's okay, got it. But the one thing [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5774.96s)]
*  I really can't relate to is the loyalty to party. What is that? I never understood that, you know, [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5778.4s)]
*  like, what you're going to agree with a bunch of people on everything that they do, and you're [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5786.32s)]
*  going to support that. It's one thing for politicians to act that way, but I cannot [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5791.76s)]
*  understand it in a media person. Do you think that's a defining [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5797.76s)]
*  fact of like our life is this commitment to party? Well, right now we have the situation [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5801.04s)]
*  where the only versions of things that you get are essentially party explanations. And that's why [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5806.0s)]
*  it's so interesting that there's this sort of intermediate podcast space, where people are [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5813.12s)]
*  exploring things from all different directions. And that's where all the people are going. I [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5820.5599999999995s)]
*  don't think it's a coincidence. Can that last? I think it can. I think what's going to happen is [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5825.04s)]
*  you're going to have new institutions that are built up around that, that are just going to find [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5830.48s)]
*  new ways to- Then you can't have, as long as that lasts, you can't have authoritarian rule. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5837.04s)]
*  Right. Oh, yeah. And that was proven. I mean, look, the handful of podcasts that a lot of people [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5841.68s)]
*  chuckled about had a huge impact in the last election. And you know what? Shame on those [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5851.76s)]
*  media people who laughed at those podcasts because among other things, they had lower numbers than a [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5857.76s)]
*  lot of those podcasts, significantly lower. Most of them, yeah. Right? And they're snobs about it. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5862.16s)]
*  They say, oh, well, we have a better quality of audience. No, you just are not convincing. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5868.400000000001s)]
*  Actually, they have a much lower quality of audience. You know, your average Rogan [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5875.68s)]
*  listener is way smarter than your average cable news viewer. Like, sorry. Right. Yeah. And they're [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5880.4800000000005s)]
*  more willing, partly because they watch shows like Joe Rogan, which ask them to entertain multiple [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5888.0s)]
*  points of view on things. Right? That's kind of the whole idea. You'll see somebody, there are lots [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5895.280000000001s)]
*  people who go on the Rogan show that I disagree with. But I hear it, you know? And that's the whole [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5900.8s)]
*  point, right? Is you get to hear different points of view. And that's been excluded from this other [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5906.8s)]
*  form of media, this kind of bifurcated red-blue landscape, which doesn't work anymore and is in [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5912.88s)]
*  collapse. But I just think that this period now, it's going to be great for launching [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5919.84s)]
*  this new media that's necessary, because they're going to have all this material to work with. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5930.56s)]
*  And because it's going to be all documents, people are going to trust it. Right? And the same way [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5935.04s)]
*  that they trusted the Twitter files, I didn't have anything to say about it. I just sort of put it [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5940.96s)]
*  out there. But all these independent organs are going to look at these reams of material, [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5944.48s)]
*  and they're going to discuss it and pass it around. And that's going to be how the public [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5954.4s)]
*  is educated, which is great. I love it. It's the best. Right? Man, you put me in such a better mood. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5959.44s)]
*  Matt Taibbi, thank you. No, thank you. Seriously. I mean, I think you would do this for free. I get [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5964.5599999999995s)]
*  that feeling. Absolutely would. I love it. Thanks, Tucker. Thank you. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5970.56s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising. That's [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5979.4400000000005s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the world right [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5984.56s)]
*  now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, with the wars, one the cusp of [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5988.56s)]
*  fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. And that [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=5993.84s)]
*  is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=6000.0s)]
*  a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way that you [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=6006.16s)]
*  could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REEtJTqJbxI&t=6010.32s)]
