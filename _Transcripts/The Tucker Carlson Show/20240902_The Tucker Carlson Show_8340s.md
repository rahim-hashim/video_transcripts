*  We can get tickets at Tucker Carlson dot com. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Hope to see you there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=55.36s)]
*  So sometimes I think to myself, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=60.0s)]
*  why are current events so unclear to so many people? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=83.28s)]
*  And I always go back to the question of history. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=87.36s)]
*  You can't really understand what's happening right now unless you understand [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=90.32s)]
*  what has happened before. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=93.32s)]
*  You certainly can't plan a coherent future unless you understand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=94.24s)]
*  And I think, well, why do people know so much so little about history? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=97.6s)]
*  Probably because it's not taught. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=101.32s)]
*  And then to the extent that it is taught in, say, airport bookstores. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=102.52s)]
*  You know, our popular historians are people like John Meacham and Michael [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=106.63999999999999s)]
*  Beschloss and Doris Kearns Goodwin and Anne Applebaum. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=109.83999999999999s)]
*  You know, not only sort of the dumbest people in the country, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=113.56s)]
*  I would say, I know most of them, but also completely dishonest political actors. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=116.92s)]
*  And so I think I just want to I can tell you hate compliments, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=120.92s)]
*  but I just want to say, I think you are the most important popular historian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=124.72s)]
*  working in the United States today. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=128.44s)]
*  You work in a different medium on Substack X podcasts. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=130.32s)]
*  But I'm a fan of yours because of the way you treat history, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=135.2s)]
*  which is with relentless curiosity and honesty. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=138.68s)]
*  And I'm sure you have all kinds of political beliefs, religious beliefs [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  or whatever, but I feel like you get to what you think is true [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=146.12s)]
*  based on really intense research. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=149.52s)]
*  So I just for those people who aren't familiar with who you are. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=151.76s)]
*  I want people to know who you are. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  And I want you to be widely recognized [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=157.88s)]
*  as the most important historian in the United States, because I think that you are. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  So that's my last compliment for our time together. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=164.52s)]
*  I know it was excruciating. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=167.32s)]
*  Tell us some of the stories. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=169.76s)]
*  We call them stories, but historical events that you have taken a really close look at. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=172.0s)]
*  Recently, so I decided to start with an easy one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=176.12s)]
*  I did a 26 hour series on the early history of Zionism [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=180.44s)]
*  and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=183.6s)]
*  whether that was naivety or hubris. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=186.84s)]
*  It turned out pretty well. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=189.6s)]
*  Yes. You know, and the reason it turned out well, I think. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=190.88s)]
*  And I've had time to really think about it over the years. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=193.96s)]
*  I started it in 2015. Took me a few years to complete. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=197.4s)]
*  But I've received hundreds of emails from Israelis, from [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=201.0s)]
*  Jews around the world who are boosters of Israel, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  as well as Palestinians and people around the Middle East [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=210.64000000000001s)]
*  and people who are critical of Israel, who all of them on all sides have kind of told me [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=213.8s)]
*  that it opened up, at least opened up their perspective to the way the other side [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=217.72s)]
*  saw the world, which is what I was going for. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=222.4s)]
*  You know, in all of my series, something that I didn't really say, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=224.64000000000001s)]
*  I think that the series that you did on the formation of Israel, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=229.24s)]
*  I think is regarded by honest people as the most honest, most non-aligned look. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=232.72s)]
*  No axes were being ground, maybe ever done. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=238.28s)]
*  Can you just tell people who aren't familiar that what did it take to produce that? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  You said it took a few years, but what did you do in preparation for it? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=245.24s)]
*  Well, you know, it's funny, actually, because [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=248.72s)]
*  when I first started it, I didn't really know what went in making a podcast like that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=252.72s)]
*  Right. So I had this experience where I started working on it after I'd read [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=256.68s)]
*  maybe like six books, because I only the series only goes up to 1948. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=261.6s)]
*  I did some follow up work on the more modern period. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=265.04s)]
*  But this is up to the foundation of the state of Israel and the lead up to that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=267.0s)]
*  Right. That's the I only covered that part. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=270.6s)]
*  And so I didn't know if this was going to be a one episode thing, a two episode thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=272.92s)]
*  I start working on it after I've read about six books on that pre 1948 period. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=276.36s)]
*  And I'm working on it for maybe, you know, quite a while, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=282.32000000000005s)]
*  taking my time because I was working for the Department of Defense at the time. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=285.44s)]
*  So it was, you know, a side gig. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=288.44s)]
*  And it wasn't even a gig. I didn't make any money from it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=290.52s)]
*  But and after a while, when I started to approach the end of that episode, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=292.68s)]
*  this is months and months and months later. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=297.68s)]
*  By now, I've read 20 books, 30 books about that pre 1948 period [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=300.68s)]
*  and a lot of the tangential topics and issues that that help better [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=305.28s)]
*  help you better understand it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=310.04s)]
*  And I went back and I started going over [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=311.76s)]
*  what I'd created for that first episode. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=314.88s)]
*  And it was so embarrassingly terrible [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=316.92s)]
*  where you look at it and you're like, this is not even that phrase, not even wrong. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=320.48s)]
*  It's like this is not even. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=324.88s)]
*  It was a nightmare to read. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=327.56s)]
*  And you realize and I realized something at that point, I was like, I've read. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=329.24s)]
*  I started this. I'd read six books on this topic. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=333.0s)]
*  Six books is a lot, you know, on a single historical topic. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  There's countless topics that I've read a book or two on. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=339.64s)]
*  And if you give me like an energy drink and let me go, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=342.92s)]
*  I'll start pontificating for hours about it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=345.48s)]
*  Oh, I know the feeling. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=348.48s)]
*  I read a book on the Federal Reserve once. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=350.6s)]
*  And so eventually I got to the point I counted them all up one time. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=352.44s)]
*  People keep asking me to put together a list. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=356.12s)]
*  I can't put together a complete one because I just didn't keep [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=357.96000000000004s)]
*  as good a track as I should. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=361.36s)]
*  But I read over 80 whole books, parts of another [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  100, at least, and about when I counted them up, I [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=366.8s)]
*  could remember about like 12, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=371.8s)]
*  1300 academic papers and journal. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=373.96s)]
*  I read everything I could find. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=377.76s)]
*  So only people in prison read any books. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=379.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, or people who work for the Department of Defense and their job entails [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=381.4s)]
*  spending eight to 10 months a year going overseas by yourself, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=386.4s)]
*  often with nothing to do in a country that nobody speaks your language. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=390.56s)]
*  So, you know, I would I would go over to work with [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=393.64s)]
*  one of our foreign allies, usually on the weapon systems that I specialized in. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=398.2s)]
*  We go over there and we work during the day. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=402.68s)]
*  Most of the Ministry of Defense people, it doesn't matter what country you go to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  You can go to Israel. You can go to Norway. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=409.64s)]
*  You can go to Japan, Korea. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=412.96s)]
*  All they want to talk about is American gun culture. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=414.08s)]
*  It's there. I've noticed. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=416.64s)]
*  And is that an interest of yours? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=419.16s)]
*  Hmm. Is that are you knowledgeable on that topic? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=421.04s)]
*  I wouldn't say I'm necessarily like technically knowledgeable, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=424.04s)]
*  like my gun friends are. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=427.04s)]
*  But yeah, in terms of, you know, I'm a hunter. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=428.76s)]
*  And I'm a gun owner, an educated gun owner, you know. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=431.52000000000004s)]
*  But I have friends who are real gun nuts that I refer to. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  That's totally fair. Right. It's all specs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=439.08000000000004s)]
*  And I say that with all affection when you know this. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=440.88s)]
*  And so, you know, I would go overseas and spend my day, work day, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=444.44s)]
*  working with them, training them, helping them with, you know, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=448.52000000000004s)]
*  whatever was broken or needed upgrading, whatever we were doing over there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  And sometimes I would spend, like I said, eight to ten months a year overseas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=455.04s)]
*  I would be doing this by myself most of the time. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=457.88s)]
*  And so after the workday was done, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=460.96s)]
*  it's just me in my hotel with nothing really to do. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  And, you know, I grew when I was growing up, I [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=466.64s)]
*  I counted these up one time and it was between kindergarten and 12th grade. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=470.28s)]
*  I went to like 35 different schools like I was changing schools [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=474.12s)]
*  sometimes every few months. Not a good sign. Sorry. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=477.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you know, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=479.71999999999997s)]
*  one of the good habits I picked up from it was reading because it gave, you know, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=482.4s)]
*  books were what gave me a sense of continuity from environment [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=486.08s)]
*  to environment to environment. Right. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=489.56s)]
*  I'm in the middle of a book and I moved to another school [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=491.56s)]
*  and I have to adjust to that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=494.4s)]
*  But I'm still reading this book and it sort of patches me over. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=495.56s)]
*  And that became sort of the background reality of my life as, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=498.2s)]
*  you know, I sort of moved around in this unpredictable way, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=503.32s)]
*  like for most of my early years, as I still have this this thread [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=507.04s)]
*  that was coherent that I was following, you know, consistently. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=510.88s)]
*  And so it definitely helped with a sense of stability like that. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=513.96s)]
*  And it implanted this idea that, you know, like I take refuge in books. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=517.56s)]
*  Yes. It's you know, they they if I'm anxious, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=521.96s)]
*  a lot of people, if they're anxious, they can't sit down and read a book [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=525.76s)]
*  because they can't sit still books. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=528.84s)]
*  Make they make my anxiety go away. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=530.88s)]
*  Yes. It's what they do for me. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=533.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm just a nerd is what I'm saying. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=534.64s)]
*  Yeah. Basically, right. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=537.64s)]
*  I'm a nerd. And I had a lot of time to read books. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  And once I started really getting obsessed with the podcast, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=541.8s)]
*  you know, it got to the point where I was waking up three hours early [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=545.92s)]
*  so that I could read and write and work on the podcast. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=549.88s)]
*  If I was in a meeting and we were waiting for the next speaker to come in, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=552.88s)]
*  I was working on the podcast lunch. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=558.08s)]
*  I was working on the podcast evening. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=560.84s)]
*  I was working on the podcast. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=562.56s)]
*  And I mean, became like a real obsession, partly partly because [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=564.36s)]
*  I mean, left to my own devices. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=569.56s)]
*  I would read books and talk to people about them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=570.84s)]
*  That's you know, if I had a trillion dollars and nothing to do with myself, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=572.8s)]
*  I would want a whole library and a bunch of interesting people [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=576.0799999999999s)]
*  to talk to about these books. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=579.16s)]
*  That's what I do anyway. Right. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  And so it was never really work. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=582.52s)]
*  But, yeah, that's the way you do it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=586.04s)]
*  People who want to do [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=588.16s)]
*  it's a lot of people I know who started doing history podcasts or other [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=591.8s)]
*  maybe not history, but not sort of conversational, just [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=595.56s)]
*  back and forth discussion podcasts where they do research [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=600.9200000000001s)]
*  and they want to make a presentation. Right. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=603.4000000000001s)]
*  And a lot of these guys who started [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  back when I started in 2015, 2016. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=608.44s)]
*  And, you know, my success up to this point has been kind of unique in the space. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=611.44s)]
*  Not everybody wants to listen to a seven hour podcast on Jim Jones. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=616.2800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, that's only the fifth out of seven episodes on the topic. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=620.08s)]
*  Right. So that's not for everybody. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=623.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, they they ask me sometimes, like, how do I [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=625.96s)]
*  how could I do this as well as you do it? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=629.88s)]
*  And other people who are like aspiring podcasters have asked me that. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=632.64s)]
*  And like you said, I don't like compliments. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=635.76s)]
*  And so I get shy when people ask me things like that. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=637.32s)]
*  But I tell them, and you're going to object to this [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=639.36s)]
*  because you're a nice fellow and everything. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=641.6s)]
*  But like, I'm not that smart. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=643.6s)]
*  I'm not that it's nothing like that. I work on this. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  You have to like, if you want to do something like this, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=649.28s)]
*  you have to be willing to get up a little early to use your lunch hour to [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=652.12s)]
*  you got to spend time in books. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=657.4s)]
*  You got to read and read. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=658.96s)]
*  And then when you think you've read enough, you got to read some more. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=660.48s)]
*  And because there's just there's so much out there. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=663.36s)]
*  Like I said, that experience after I had read six books [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=665.72s)]
*  on just the pre 1948 period of, you know, the Zionist [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=669.0400000000001s)]
*  Israeli-Palestinian conflict story. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=672.5600000000001s)]
*  And I knew nothing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=674.5600000000001s)]
*  I knew nothing. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=676.12s)]
*  Like embarrassingly, worse than nothing. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=677.48s)]
*  Because like, at least before I read the book, the illusion of knowledge. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. At least before I had read the books, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=682.96s)]
*  I would just be repeating to you whatever I had heard, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=685.88s)]
*  you know, Benjamin Netanyahu say or somebody, whatever, somebody like on TV. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=689.92s)]
*  I at least would have just been repeating that. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=695.0s)]
*  This was worse. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=698.16s)]
*  This was like the full midwit kind of meme in production where [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=699.0s)]
*  where you know enough to really embarrass yourself. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=704.48s)]
*  And I'm glad that I sort of recognize that at the time. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  And I went back and like scrapped the whole thing. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=710.48s)]
*  Didn't start it for another year after that, probably, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=712.68s)]
*  because I just realized that, you know, I got to get deeper into this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=715.92s)]
*  And as I've moved through different topics over the years, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=719.4799999999999s)]
*  because I don't do an Israel Palestine podcast, I do a history podcast. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=724.04s)]
*  And I choose topics based on [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=727.4s)]
*  what I want to read about. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=731.5999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's all it is. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=733.0s)]
*  Like usually while I'm working on one [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=734.04s)]
*  something as I'm sort of getting into the second half, finishing it up, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  so I can see the finish line on the thing I'm working on now. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=741.36s)]
*  It'll get harder and harder to discipline myself, to stay on that topic, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=744.28s)]
*  because there's something that's pulling me away. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=748.04s)]
*  I know the feeling. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=749.84s)]
*  Yeah. And so it's like a feeling of relief where like I finish it [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=750.84s)]
*  and now I can I already know the next topic because it just emerged kind of naturally. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=754.08s)]
*  And I move on to that. And sometimes they're very, very different. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=758.16s)]
*  I've done, like I said, a, you know, 32 hour series [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=760.0s)]
*  on the Jonestown Cult, which turned into you say, how do you do 32 hours on that? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=765.0s)]
*  I told the story of the 32 hours. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=770.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the reason for that, and I didn't know this going in. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=773.92s)]
*  I never know exactly how this is going to unfold when I'm going in, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=776.48s)]
*  unless it's like sometimes I'll do a single episode and I kind of know the story. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=779.48s)]
*  But when I start a long series, it's going to take me a year [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=782.64s)]
*  and a half to put out every episode. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=785.32s)]
*  I don't necessarily know how it's going to turn out. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=786.84s)]
*  And, you know, when you look at something like the Jonestown [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=789.68s)]
*  Cult and for people who don't know, you know, 1978, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=792.92s)]
*  everybody's heard the phrase, don't drink the Kool-Aid. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. And that's what people know about Jonestown, basically, is that [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=799.0s)]
*  Christianity sometimes goes off the rails. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=803.64s)]
*  Don't drink the Kool-Aid. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=805.92s)]
*  Thousand people, you know, nine hundred, I think, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=807.6s)]
*  16 people committed mass suicide in the jungles of Guyana. Right. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=810.52s)]
*  At the direction of this of this preacher, Jim Jones. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=814.72s)]
*  That's what most people know about it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=818.64s)]
*  When you open any book about it, even mainstream books about it, which, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=820.32s)]
*  you know, again, most people don't get to that point. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=823.36s)]
*  This won't be in any of the documentaries, for the most part that you see. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=825.36s)]
*  We open to like page one or two of any book about it. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=829.32s)]
*  And the first thing you see is that 75 percent of the people that died out there [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=832.48s)]
*  were African-Americans. Yeah. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=836.36s)]
*  Black women from Oakland. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=838.04s)]
*  From Oakland. But if they were over [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=840.12s)]
*  40 or 50 years old, there weren't really any black people in Oakland [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=843.72s)]
*  until the Second World War. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=846.84s)]
*  So these were migrants who had come from the South as part of the Great Migration. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=848.52s)]
*  Right. And you think like if 75 percent of the people that died out there [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=852.24s)]
*  were Mexican immigrants, first generation Mexican, that that [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=857.12s)]
*  that wouldn't be a part of the story. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=861.2s)]
*  That would be like the story. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=862.4s)]
*  Like what is going on here? Right. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=863.68s)]
*  Not just how did this religious cult get out of control? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=865.24s)]
*  And like, like, you really need to understand that. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=868.72s)]
*  I never knew that. I always knew about Jonestown on the surface level. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=871.32s)]
*  But I saw that I'm like, I have to understand this better. And so, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=874.68s)]
*  you know, it drew me deep into the history of African-American [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=879.16s)]
*  life in America post post slavery. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=883.6800000000001s)]
*  And really, really deep into the Great Migration and the forces that drove it [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=887.28s)]
*  and the experiences that African-Americans encountered when they got to the cities, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=890.96s)]
*  the north and west, when they left the rural south. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=894.8s)]
*  And, you know, when I get emotional when I think about the Jonestown story, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=897.5600000000001s)]
*  I worked on that for a long time. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=903.2s)]
*  I read literally every single book or thing that's been written about it. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=904.8s)]
*  And there's a lot of documents. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=908.96s)]
*  I think was UCSB had an interview. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=912.28s)]
*  I mean, there's just a lot out there. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=914.84s)]
*  Well, not only that, the FBI sees a thousand hours of tapes from Jonestown [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=916.0s)]
*  after the suicide and they're all available online. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=920.4s)]
*  I've listened to all of it and most of it twice. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=922.56s)]
*  Like for months, I had this guy's sermons in my head. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=925.52s)]
*  I had their like backroom midnight meetings where they're all going through [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=929.12s)]
*  struggle sessions, screaming at each other, beating each other up. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=933.16s)]
*  All of their recordings of these late night torchlight sessions [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=936.6s)]
*  that they would have out in Guyana in the jungle. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=940.52s)]
*  You know, if you watch most documentaries about Jonestown, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=943.72s)]
*  it's all about the craziness of the last year, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=946.6s)]
*  which is when they were all actually in Jonestown, in Guyana. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=949.48s)]
*  These people have been together for 20 years. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=953.08s)]
*  He started his first church in the 1950s. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=955.12s)]
*  And this is a guy, Jim Jones, who, you know, in 1953 in Indianapolis, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=957.32s)]
*  which was a KKK stronghold at the time, you know, because the second KKK [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=964.88s)]
*  was not really a southern anti-black movement. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=969.5600000000001s)]
*  It was more of a Midwest and northern urban anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=972.4s)]
*  And so Indianapolis was one of the strongholds. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=977.8s)]
*  And he lived, that's where he lived at the time. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=980.3199999999999s)]
*  He's like a 23 year old guy. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=982.72s)]
*  He was born 39, maybe 24 years old, starting his first little Methodist [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=985.4399999999999s)]
*  church in this storefront with folding chairs, you know, and he and his congregation [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=989.9599999999999s)]
*  are going out and boycotting stores in 1953, years before anybody heard of a bus [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=995.04s)]
*  boycott or anything like that. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1000.88s)]
*  And, you know, with Martin Luther King, he's going out there and doing that, [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1002.32s)]
*  getting death threats from KKK leaders, getting death threats from the American [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1005.48s)]
*  Nazi party, trying to integrate these businesses. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1008.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1011.0s)]
*  And so this is a true believer. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1012.36s)]
*  Like when it comes to his family, he adopted the first African, he was the first white [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1013.8s)]
*  family to adopt an African-American child in the history of the state of Indiana. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1018.56s)]
*  And this was back in the fifties. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1022.92s)]
*  And he was, you know, Jim Jones had been hit by a bus in 1962. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1024.96s)]
*  They moved out to, they moved out to the Bay area in 1965. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1030.3999999999999s)]
*  He would be remembered today as one of the early pioneers of the American [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1036.44s)]
*  civil rights movement and like revered for it. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1039.48s)]
*  He really would be. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1041.3999999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1042.6399999999999s)]
*  And so I started to read about this stuff and I realized that there was this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1043.2s)]
*  theme that was starting to emerge in all of my podcasts for the most part. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  And the Israel-Palestine one and this one, which is here's this guy who really [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1052.32s)]
*  is an idealist and I'm not saying he didn't have pathologies, you know, that [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1056.96s)]
*  were already inherent in there, although I'm very suspicious of accounts when, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1060.88s)]
*  you know, whenever I'm reading a book about, and all of the Jim Jones biographies [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1064.5600000000002s)]
*  are like this and you have to learn how to like read past it, but you're reading [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1070.1200000000001s)]
*  a book about Stalin and the author went and found and interviewed somebody who [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1074.16s)]
*  was in sixth grade with him or something. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1079.5600000000002s)]
*  And they're like, you know, he got tripped on the playground one time and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1081.3200000000002s)]
*  stood up and said, I'll get revenge on all of you one day. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1084.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's when I knew I'm, I just, I'm very suspicious of all those stories, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1087.24s)]
*  you know? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1093.12s)]
*  And so you have this guy who's a true idealist and he could be, you know, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1093.48s)]
*  whether or not his, his, his politics were correct or whether his, you know, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1097.28s)]
*  was misguided, that's a separate question. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1102.08s)]
*  He was an idealist. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1104.24s)]
*  Like he really believed these things. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1105.1599999999999s)]
*  He really did treat people in a way that in 1953 in America was uncommon, you [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1107.28s)]
*  know? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1112.64s)]
*  And, and so you have this idealist, just like with the, in the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1113.1200000000001s)]
*  conflict at the beginning, you read all the early accounts of the early Zionists. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1120.76s)]
*  And it's all about, it's just, it's soaring rhetoric about returning to the Holy [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1125.2800000000002s)]
*  Land and there's people who have really grand idealistic visions of what it's [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1130.0800000000002s)]
*  going to be like when they get down there. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1135.24s)]
*  And then people run into the rocks of reality and how we respond to that. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1138.0s)]
*  Pressure, you know, really defines the, the, the, the destiny of a movement and [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1143.44s)]
*  the people in it. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1149.3200000000002s)]
*  And there are always, there are always going to be people and sometimes entire [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1150.48s)]
*  movements that the pressure ends up, you know, turning them off the road completely, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1155.0400000000002s)]
*  you know, and into a ravine. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1161.88s)]
*  And that's kind of what happens. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1162.88s)]
*  So if you look at like the Jonestown story, the reason it turned into a 32 [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1163.8400000000001s)]
*  hour series is, like I said, they started in the 1950s doing stuff that you would [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  recognize as just early civil rights stuff, you know, boycotting a local business [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1174.52s)]
*  to get them to integrate right around the time, few years before, but like that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1178.9599999999998s)]
*  Martin Luther King was going to start that kind of thing. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1182.4799999999998s)]
*  And then, so you have Greensboro, you have these things and their trajectory as an [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1184.36s)]
*  organization, the People's Temple, I realized, I mean, they, that, that [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1189.32s)]
*  trajectory from about 53 to 1978, when everything came to an end, that 25 year [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1194.2s)]
*  trajectory follows almost to the month. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1199.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is uncanny, like how perfectly it follows. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1203.6000000000001s)]
*  It makes perfect sense because of how plugged into it they were. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1206.76s)]
*  It follows the trajectory of the civil rights and protest movement in America [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1209.76s)]
*  through its rise, its peak, its radicalization, and then its decline in the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1214.2s)]
*  late sixties and then into the seventies into insanity and death. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, and it is. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1224.84s)]
*  I mean, it's almost a month. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1227.28s)]
*  You can tell the story of Jonestown and give a month by month account of that [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1228.4399999999998s)]
*  process, of those protest movements being radicalized and turning to violence and [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1233.6s)]
*  insanity in the sixties and seventies. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1238.36s)]
*  And so it became a vehicle for that. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  And that's what, that's what really the story is about. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1241.84s)]
*  It's about that period of American history from the mid fifties up until about 1980. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1244.0s)]
*  So how'd you like to cut your cell phone bill in half every single month? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1249.5600000000002s)]
*  That's probably pretty high. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1253.76s)]
*  Have you checked it recently? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1254.52s)]
*  Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile want you to believe that you have to have something [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1256.0400000000002s)]
*  called unlimited data and maybe you're in the small percentage that do need [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1260.2s)]
*  unlimited data, whatever that is. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1264.68s)]
*  But for most people, you do not need unlimited data and you certainly [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1266.28s)]
*  shouldn't be forced to pay for it. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1270.48s)]
*  That's where PureTalk comes in. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1272.64s)]
*  PureTalk only charges you for the data that you want. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1273.92s)]
*  How about that? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1276.6000000000001s)]
*  If you walked into an ice cream parlor and they said you can only buy 11 cones [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1277.8s)]
*  and you said, I just want one. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1282.08s)]
*  You probably wouldn't go back, would you? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1284.04s)]
*  No, you go to the place that sold you what you wanted. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1285.56s)]

*  and they were true believers. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1428.56s)]

*  of the movement, to be honest with you. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1448.24s)]
*  He was just sort of the titular leader, but, uh, the movement, the, the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1449.44s)]
*  organization was running itself and you had a bunch of true believers who were [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1453.32s)]

*  And in the last few months, when they're approaching just maximum psychosis and [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1461.72s)]
*  paranoia, you've got like Angela Davis, Huey Newton, Harvey milk, like a lot of [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1467.32s)]
*  these, I think he might, you got killed shortly after who are literally calling [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1473.6399999999999s)]
*  into Jonestown and being put on the speaker for everybody to listen, saying, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1477.56s)]

*  paranoia and psychosis is going to lead to their mass death within a few months. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1496.04s)]
*  And that's what these people are doing, calling in, just feeding into it. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1500.28s)]
*  And, you know, it makes me sick because you have people, and I know this wasn't [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1504.0s)]
*  maybe supposed to be just a Jonestown thing, but this topic again, like it's. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1508.72s)]

*  Like there's this one woman, she was the lead singer of the Jonestown band. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1515.08s)]
*  And the night before they all committed suicide, Leo Ryan, the congressman was [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1520.56s)]
*  there and his entourage was there and they put on a performance and there's a video. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1524.88s)]

*  Yep. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1531.68s)]
*  And there's a video of that night, you know, it was in the, and they show a [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1532.1200000000001s)]
*  musical performance and this woman who's the lead singer and band conductor is up [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1538.3600000000001s)]
*  there and she's this, you know, this African-American woman, beautiful, great [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1543.48s)]
*  voice up there, like really like confidently commanding the stage and like [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1547.5200000000002s)]
*  in really in her element, right? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1552.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, her backstory was back in Indianapolis. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1555.0400000000002s)]
*  Uh, Jim Jones, when his family had lived there, knew her when she was a little [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1558.0400000000002s)]
*  girl, just a little bit, like her mom came to the church sometimes, something like that. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1562.3600000000001s)]
*  And after Jim Jones and his people left, uh, you know, she got abandoned by her mother. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1567.3600000000001s)]
*  She ended up, um, being pimped out by her drug dealer boyfriend when she was 15, 16 [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1575.0s)]
*  years old and she's living her life on the streets, being beat up by this guy [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1583.76s)]
*  who's forcing her to go out and, uh, and prostitute for him, you know, and that's [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1588.6s)]
*  her life and now she's about 20, she's committed suicide three or four times at [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1593.52s)]
*  this point, uh, and now she's 20 and the Jonestown people make a trip back to [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1596.84s)]
*  Indianapolis cause they would go around the country and their buses and, you [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1601.4s)]
*  know, speak at churches and hold events and stuff. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1604.4s)]
*  And so they go back there and she just kind of knew who the Jones family was. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1606.56s)]
*  She said they treated her with kindness and her mother with kindness when she [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1611.76s)]
*  was a little girl and she's in the, in the depth of suicidal depression, drug [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1614.64s)]
*  addiction, you know, uh, it's just, she's close to the end, right? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1618.8799999999999s)]
*  And, um, man, even when the podcast when I was recording, it makes me emotional [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1624.36s)]
*  because they got out there. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1630.0s)]
*  She, she went there to the event when the, when the Jonestown people came in [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1632.16s)]
*  because she just remembered that like these people had been kind to her 15 years [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1635.52s)]
*  ago, you know, when she was a little girl. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1639.64s)]
*  So she came out to see and Jim Jones sees her and immediately recognizes her. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1641.2800000000002s)]
*  And starts talking to her, just, you know, friendly, everything, the people [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1646.68s)]
*  like start talking to her and she starts telling them kind of about how her life's [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1651.5600000000002s)]
*  gone since that time. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1655.72s)]
*  And he said, Oh, well great. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1657.72s)]
*  Like, or he said, not great, but he said, Oh, well come with us, hop on the bus. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1659.72s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1663.72s)]
*  Like we've got houses, we've got a whole community out here. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1664.2800000000002s)]
*  Like, you know, we can find a job for you until you do something, whatever. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1666.52s)]
*  Yeah, come on out. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1670.92s)]
*  And so she did, she did. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1671.68s)]
*  And she went out there and they cleaned her up. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1673.4s)]
*  They got her off drugs. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1675.96s)]
*  They took this broken, destroyed, abused woman and put her in an environment [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1677.4s)]
*  where it, and again, you have to understand that even this, this psychotic [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1684.04s)]
*  movement, you know, the way it turned out, this part was genuine. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1689.0s)]
*  They put her into an environment where she felt like she belonged and it really [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1691.84s)]
*  was the people cared about her and she cared about the people there, you know? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1697.3999999999999s)]
*  And so she ends up being the band leader. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1701.9199999999998s)]
*  She's like a super talented magician, a musician, and she's writing the songs. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1703.44s)]
*  She's leading the practices for the band. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1708.9199999999998s)]
*  She's the lead singer and everything. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1711.56s)]

*  all the rest of those old people and kids and everybody else, she, um, she [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1719.44s)]

*  a lot of people's favorite episode. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1745.24s)]
*  Um, it like I have a rule that I don't start a podcast until I feel like I can [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1746.68s)]
*  at least understand where everybody in this story is coming from. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1753.0800000000002s)]
*  I didn't start the Israel Palestine podcast until I felt like I could see how [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1757.1200000000001s)]
*  the Zionists saw things, how the Arabs saw things, how the British saw things [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1761.88s)]
*  and how their behavior toward each other made sense to them in the context of, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1766.76s)]
*  of their own world. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1771.68s)]
*  And I did the same thing with Jonestown, which was a challenge. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1773.28s)]
*  Cause I mean, talking about, uh, you know, a psychotic cult leader who, who [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1776.44s)]
*  who dragged his people to their deaths, you know, in the jungle, their meaningless [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1782.04s)]
*  deaths, there were literally people Tucker who, I mean, hundreds of people, parents [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1785.48s)]
*  who were injecting cyanide into their baby's mouths, uh, and watching them froth [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1789.72s)]
*  and twitch until they were sure they were dead. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1795.16s)]
*  And then they could take the suicide, uh, drink themselves because they had done [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1797.04s)]
*  that this is almost a thousand people. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1801.04s)]
*  It was one woman who was in the Capitol. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1803.7199999999998s)]
*  She wasn't, she was at their office in the Capitol. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1806.36s)]
*  She wasn't out at the, um, at the actual compound in which she got the call. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1808.28s)]
*  Like it's time we're doing it. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1812.56s)]
*  She slashed her kid's throats and then stabbed herself in the heart. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1814.32s)]
*  I mean, this is, uh, and yet these people loved each other. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1817.28s)]
*  These people actually did believe like in equality. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1825.04s)]
*  They believed in like human brotherhood and all these things. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1830.08s)]
*  And she slashed her kid's throats. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1832.8s)]
*  And you, if you're going to tell a story like that, you can't do what all of [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1835.52s)]
*  the biographies of Jim Jones do. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1839.52s)]
*  You know, they'll all talk about like these weird things about him as a kid and [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1841.1999999999998s)]
*  some something where it was all there at the beginning and it was just the, the [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1844.36s)]
*  gradual, you know, the gradual flowering and unfolding of this psychosis that [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1848.36s)]
*  had always been in there and all these other people just got sucked into it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1852.96s)]
*  It's just, it's total nonsense. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1857.08s)]
*  You really have to understand how people could get to a place like [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1859.04s)]
*  that from where they were. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1862.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, everybody doesn't matter who you're talking about. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1864.2s)]
*  Uday Hussein. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1867.68s)]
*  Uh, there was a time, and I always try to keep this in mind because. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1869.08s)]
*  I mean, it's like, it's one of the governing thoughts as I go through any [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1875.52s)]
*  of these stories, Uday Hussein, Joseph Stalin, I don't care who you're talking [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1878.52s)]
*  about, there was a time where that was a little three-year-old kid and they [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1882.0s)]
*  weren't evil, they weren't, um, who they became. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1886.92s)]
*  And so how did they become what they ended up being? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1891.28s)]
*  You know? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1895.64s)]
*  So I think you're approaching this, which is why I am so impressed by what you do [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1896.04s)]
*  and want more people to experience it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1901.72s)]
*  Um, you're approaching this from the most honest possible perspective and allowing [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1905.3600000000001s)]
*  readers, viewers, listeners to come to their conclusions with them, with the [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1910.76s)]
*  maximum amount of information, which you're not doing is using history as a [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1914.12s)]
*  weapon, a cudgel, um, or as a kind of propaganda tool to make policy. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1920.6s)]
*  So in that you're, you almost stand alone, I would say right now. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1927.1599999999999s)]
*  Uh, I'm really interested in the project that you're working on now. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1931.76s)]
*  I'm a little bit baffled by it, so I'm just going to answer my own questions. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1935.52s)]
*  So you were working on, uh, World War II. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1938.36s)]
*  Which has to be even more than the Kennedy assassination, the most written [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1942.08s)]
*  about event in human history. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1947.3999999999999s)]
*  I can't think of one that has occasion more books. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1948.4399999999998s)]
*  So, um, why World War II? [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1951.04s)]
*  Well, uh, you know, I was giving a talk to, uh, a, an, um, a graduate history [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1955.2399999999998s)]
*  class, the University of Vienna a while back online, um, giving them a talk. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1961.8s)]
*  And, uh, one of the things that I said to them, and I was curious how this was [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1966.84s)]
*  going to go over in Austria, um, but it seemed to go over all right, as I told [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1971.92s)]
*  them over the next few decades, like, look, anytime you have a historical event. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1975.8799999999999s)]
*  For us in the United States, it's the civil rights movement, it's World War II. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1980.96s)]
*  And to a certain degree, it's still the civil war. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1985.12s)]
*  Everything in between and before those things, you can do whatever you want. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1988.4s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1991.48s)]
*  You think that the Russians were to blame for World War I and not the Germans. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1991.96s)]
*  You think it was all British conspiracy. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1995.96s)]
*  You can do whatever you want. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1997.56s)]
*  It's fine. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1998.3400000000001s)]
*  Because that's not part of the founding mythology of the order that we're all [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=1999.24s)]
*  living in at this time, right? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2004.48s)]
*  Those other things are. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2005.88s)]
*  And whenever you have a historical event that is mythologized, and when I say [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2007.28s)]
*  that, I don't mean myth, like that's a myth, that's a lie. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2012.88s)]
*  That's not what I mean. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2016.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean that it's, it's a formative part of how we all understand the world we're [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2016.76s)]
*  in, or at least officially, like the official world, like the structures we live in. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2021.24s)]
*  It's the justification for a lot of those structures, right? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2025.68s)]
*  Whenever you have those things, you're going to have taboos. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2029.0s)]
*  You're going to have certain ways that certain topics have to be talked about [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2033.6000000000001s)]
*  that are going to guarantee that that, that that topic is just profoundly [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2038.48s)]
*  misunderstood. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2042.8400000000001s)]
*  And I told the students at the University of Vienna, I said, over the next couple [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2044.28s)]
*  decades, like we're going to get to a point where the interwar period and the [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2049.0s)]
*  second world war are far enough away that people can actually start taking a [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2054.08s)]
*  more honest look at everything that went on. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2057.52s)]
*  And it is going to be the most fruitful place that any aspiring historian can [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2060.0s)]
*  dive into because we spent the last 70 years, I mean, in Europe's case, like [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2063.96s)]
*  literally throwing people in jail for looking into the wrong corners, right? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2068.04s)]
*  So there's so, and even, even particularly in Austria, right, right. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  And so even in the United States, it was an invaded country. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2075.56s)]
*  So I'm not exactly sure why it's so important. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2077.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2080.64s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's a big topic, but I mean, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  even the United States where, where, where you're not going to go to jail [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2083.96s)]
*  necessarily for doing that. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2088.36s)]
*  You might have your life ruined and lose your job. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2090.52s)]
*  You might absolutely go to jail in this country. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2092.32s)]
*  Nowadays you might. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2094.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2095.0s)]
*  But you know, for you could write a book, you could take any angle on it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2096.16s)]
*  You want, you're not going to ever get a job or have a publisher want to publish [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2100.16s)]
*  it or anything, but you could do it. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2103.2400000000002s)]
*  You can go out on the street corner and stand on a box and say whatever it is you [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2104.7200000000003s)]
*  think. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2107.56s)]
*  Uh, but even, even still, you know, that event is really, it's, it's, it's, it's [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2108.48s)]
*  such a core part of the state religion that there are emotional triggers built [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2115.12s)]
*  into people since childhood that almost prevent them from, from taking an [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2119.64s)]
*  approach that would, uh, that would, that might lead them to information or to [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2126.04s)]
*  conclusions that are not part of the state religion's version of, of that [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2130.64s)]
*  event, you know? [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2134.16s)]
*  And, and again, you're going to find that I'm sure the Peloponnesian wars were [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2135.04s)]
*  like that for the ancient Greeks. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2139.0s)]
*  Well, by the way, the American Revolution, which is now totally irrelevant to [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2141.48s)]
*  modern America, unfortunately, was like that. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2145.52s)]
*  The life of Lincoln was like that. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2147.96s)]
*  Lincoln was an extra very complicated guy. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2149.28s)]
*  It's not an endorsement of slavery. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2151.96s)]
*  Well, speaking for myself, I think slavery is disgusting. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2154.04s)]
*  That's the worst thing. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2155.8s)]
*  I, if you, what you're saying is absolutely right. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2157.08s)]
*  It's not just the second world war that is sort of uniquely censored or, uh, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2158.96s)]
*  protected the mythology around it. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2164.84s)]
*  It's, it's every event that's central to a nation's understanding of itself. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2167.28s)]
*  And then that changes over time. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2170.7200000000003s)]
*  So do you think that we are far enough away 80 years from that war where you [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2171.92s)]
*  can try to take as an objective, a look as you can and that will be allowed? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2177.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, no, I don't. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2183.52s)]
*  Um, I think we've got a little, little ways to go on that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2185.36s)]
*  Uh, but I hope I can kind of start to break the ice a little bit, you know, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2189.1200000000003s)]
*  because like here's the problem with doing something like that. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2192.96s)]
*  And this is something I'm very aware of as I research it and start to work on [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2197.88s)]
*  the project is that when you have a mythologized historical event that is [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2200.7200000000003s)]
*  told, that is, I mean, again, you go to a lot of places in Europe, it's a [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2205.92s)]
*  legal requirement over here. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2210.48s)]
*  It's not quite that, but it almost might as well be, uh, where that, that this [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2212.36s)]
*  event is going to be described from a certain perspective, you're going to [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2216.2000000000003s)]
*  approach it a certain way, uh, you're there are just certain things. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2219.7200000000003s)]
*  You're not allowed to question. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2222.84s)]
*  You have to literally it's a crime to ask questions. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2223.88s)]
*  Um, then whenever that's the case, when you try to add any type of [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2227.0s)]
*  balance to that account, when you try to tell the story in a way that [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2232.1200000000003s)]
*  brings other approaches and other perspectives into it, it's going to [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2235.6800000000003s)]
*  look like you're trying to justify those other things. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2238.56s)]
*  That's just how it's going to seem to people who are very locked into this side. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2242.36s)]
*  And so if you start talking about the interwar period and how weimar the [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2245.6800000000003s)]
*  Weimar culture, you know, after the first world war led to something like, uh, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2250.72s)]
*  the rise of the national socialists and why the people who embraced that [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2255.64s)]
*  movement did embrace it in a way that's not just, you know, was because they [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2259.3999999999996s)]
*  were, you know, you had this country, Germany, a sophisticated cultural, uh, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2264.56s)]
*  you know, superpower that was fine. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2269.7599999999998s)]
*  And then they all turned into demons for a few years and now they're fine again. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2271.9199999999996s)]
*  Like that's sort of the official story. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2275.24s)]
*  And I think deep down, we all know that makes no sense. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2276.72s)]
*  Everything has a cause, you know, again, to go back like Uday Hussain got to be [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2279.8s)]
*  Uday Hussain from that three-year-old little kid, Jim Jones got to be Jim [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2283.6000000000004s)]
*  Jones from being that guy who was just an earnest local Indianapolis civil [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2288.1600000000003s)]
*  rights, uh, activist. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2293.6800000000003s)]
*  They all got to be those people that led to the chaos that they eventually [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2295.52s)]
*  invited into the world and onto themselves and their people through [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2300.32s)]
*  their experiences in the world. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2303.88s)]
*  And through a series of decisions, decision points that at the time, if [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  you can, if you can bring yourself to step into the shoes of those people, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2313.1200000000003s)]
*  and it's not a comfortable thing to do. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2317.84s)]
*  I mean, I literally listened to probably 2000 hours of Jim Jones's sermons and [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2319.76s)]
*  him screaming at his people and just going insane to the point where I was [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2325.0800000000004s)]
*  dreaming about this guy for months. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2328.4s)]
*  I would have my headphones in as I was working, listening to Jim Jones. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2330.28s)]
*  And it's really hard. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2334.04s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2335.04s)]
*  You're the only guy in the office doing that. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2335.52s)]
*  I think I'm probably the only person in the world that's done that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2337.16s)]
*  And so like, and I got to the point where I felt like I knew this guy. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2341.56s)]
*  I, I could notice from tape to tape, I would hear changes in his tone of voice. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2345.68s)]
*  And I knew whether he was, uh, high on amphetamines that day, or if he had [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2352.04s)]
*  taken his barbiturates already, and now he's, you could just, I felt like I knew [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2356.48s)]
*  this guy and their tapes, by the way, they're not all from like one year. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2359.96s)]
*  They're from like 15, 20 years. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2364.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2366.16s)]
*  So you can, you can watch this process of, uh, uh, of, of a descent into madness [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2366.4s)]
*  as it's happening and, you know, to get to a point where you can bring yourself to [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2373.12s)]
*  step into the shoes of any other human being and understand that as much as, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2377.68s)]
*  you know, as much as it makes you uncomfortable, it is just a human being. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2383.0s)]
*  And at the very, very like base level, their motivations are the same as yours. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2387.0s)]
*  Their needs are the same as yours. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2391.08s)]
*  Um, but that we're very, we're multivariate species. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2392.92s)]
*  They can go a lot of different directions, right? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2395.96s)]
*  And, um, and to be able to do that and force yourself to do it is the key. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2399.32s)]
*  And so when you do something like that with, I mean, again, like a historical [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2403.32s)]
*  event, like world war II, where, I mean, the one rule is that you shall not do that. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2407.2s)]
*  You shall not look at this topic and try to understand how the Germans saw the world. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2411.92s)]
*  Like how the whole thing from the first world war on up to the very end of the war, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2418.48s)]
*  how these people might've genuinely felt like they were the ones under attack, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2425.1200000000003s)]
*  that they were the ones being victimized by their neighbors and by all these, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2430.44s)]
*  by, by the allied powers, you know, and you can, you can handle that, uh, with [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2435.2000000000003s)]
*  a sentence, you know, you can wave it off and say, well, you know, they're [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2441.44s)]
*  justifying themselves or they're rationalizing their evil or whatever you [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2444.1600000000003s)]
*  want to say, but again, that's, it's, I think we're getting to the point where [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2447.28s)]
*  that's very unsatisfying for people. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2451.0s)]
*  Most of us, well, actually all of us go through our daily lives using all sorts [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2452.88s)]
*  of quote free technology without paying attention to why it's quote free. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2456.6400000000003s)]
*  Who's paying for this and how think about it from it. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2462.44s)]
*  Think about your free email account, the free messenger system used to chat with [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2465.8s)]
*  your friends, the free other weather app or game app you open up and never think [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2470.2400000000002s)]
*  about it's all free. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2475.36s)]
*  But is it? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2477.32s)]
*  No, it's not free. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2478.2400000000002s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products and just giving them to [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2480.8s)]
*  you because they love you. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2484.2400000000002s)]
*  They're doing it because their programs take all your information. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2486.52s)]
*  They hoover up your data, private personal data and sell it to data [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2489.28s)]
*  brokers and the government. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2493.84s)]
*  And all of those people who are not your friends are very interested in [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2496.84s)]
*  manipulating you and your personal political and financial decisions. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2500.36s)]
*  It's scary as hell and it's happening out in the open without anybody saying [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2504.6s)]
*  anything about it. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2508.52s)]
*  This is a huge problem and we've been talking about this problem to our friend, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2510.36s)]
*  Eric Prince for years. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2514.16s)]
*  Someone needs to fix this and he and his partners have and now we're partners with [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2515.32s)]
*  them and their company is called unplugged. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2519.56s)]
*  It's not a software company. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2522.4s)]
*  It's a hardware company. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2523.64s)]
*  They actually make a phone. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2525.2s)]
*  The phone is called unplugged and it's more than that. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2527.48s)]
*  The purpose of the phone is to protect you from having your life stolen, your [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2530.6400000000003s)]
*  data stolen. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2537.44s)]
*  It's designed from a privacy first perspective. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2538.44s)]
*  It's got an operating system that they made. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2542.6800000000003s)]
*  It's called messenger and other apps that help you take charge of your personal [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2544.2400000000002s)]
*  data and prevent it from getting passed around to data brokers and government [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2547.2400000000002s)]
*  agencies that will use it to manipulate you. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2551.6000000000004s)]
*  Unplugged is to its customers. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2554.56s)]
*  They will promise you and they mean it that your data are not being sold [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2556.76s)]
*  or monetized or shared with anyone from basics like it's custom Libertas [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2560.24s)]
*  operating system, which they wrote, which is designed from the very first day to [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2565.2s)]
*  keep your personal data on your device. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2569.04s)]
*  It also has, believe it or not, a true on off switch that shuts off the power. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2571.8399999999997s)]
*  It actually disconnects your battery and ensures that your microphone and your [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2576.4799999999996s)]
*  camera are turned off completely when you want them to be. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2580.9199999999996s)]
*  So they're not spying on you and say your bedroom, which your iPhone is. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2584.4799999999996s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2588.08s)]
*  So it is a great way. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  One of the few ways to actually protect yourself from big tech and big government [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2591.28s)]
*  to reclaim your personal privacy without privacy, there is no freedom. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2595.1200000000003s)]
*  The unplug phone. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2599.8s)]
*  You can get a $25 discount when you use the code Tucker at the checkout. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2600.76s)]
*  So go to unplug.com slash Tucker to get yours today. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2604.84s)]
*  Highly recommended. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2609.4s)]
*  It's more than unsatisfying. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2610.48s)]
*  I mean, it's childish and shallow, of course. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2613.7200000000003s)]
*  Hold on. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2617.0800000000004s)]
*  Let me, sorry to interrupt. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2617.5600000000004s)]
*  But that's true. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2618.68s)]
*  But every society has founding myths. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2619.68s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2622.24s)]
*  And, and you need them, you know, like, I don't think that we're necessarily better [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2623.04s)]
*  off now that people are, uh, now that people are able to just freely tear down [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2627.64s)]
*  a statue of George Washington, cause he was a slave owner, right? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2635.3599999999997s)]
*  And so like there are sacred, uh, symbols and national myths that any group of [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2638.3999999999996s)]
*  people are going to need to hold themselves together. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2643.7599999999998s)]
*  And there's also parallel in knowing the truth about things. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2645.96s)]
*  I mean, if when we finally find out how president Kennedy was murdered in 1963, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2648.64s)]
*  when we finally find out what all these weird lights in the sky are at night, we [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2653.72s)]
*  really get to the truth of that. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2656.56s)]
*  Will we be better off or not? [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2658.56s)]
*  I mean, those, you know, those are fair questions. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2660.08s)]
*  I don't know the answer. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2662.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, but, but let me just say what I completely agree with you, particularly [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2663.96s)]
*  any unifying myth, you know, is important. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2669.96s)]
*  Um, I'm just highly distressed by the uses to which the myths about World War [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2672.8s)]
*  II have been put in the context of modern foreign policy, particularly the war in [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2680.52s)]
*  Ukraine, but, but not just the war in Ukraine, so many others, you know, [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2686.2000000000003s)]
*  Churchill's the good guy, Neville Chamberlain's the bad guy. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2690.1200000000003s)]
*  You know, it's just, it's too, uh, Pat, it's obviously quite been all, uh, but [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2694.1600000000003s)]
*  it also has justified like the killing of millions of people since the end of [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2699.36s)]
*  the second world war. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2703.08s)]
*  And so I do think it's fair to ask like what, what really was going on. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2703.84s)]
*  So why, for example, and I'm American, I'm not English, so I don't have any [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2707.6800000000003s)]
*  weird motive in asking this, but how would you assess Winston Churchill? [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2713.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh, I got in trouble with my podcast partner, Jaco Willink one time because [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2718.32s)]
*  he's a New England Dutchman who's his family it's near and dear to their Dutch, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2722.76s)]
*  but very near and dear to their heart that Winston Churchill is a hero. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2728.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2732.1600000000003s)]
*  Everyone thinks that he really thinks that. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2732.4s)]
*  And I told him that I think, and maybe I'm being a little hyperbolic, maybe, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2735.2400000000002s)]
*  but I told him maybe trying to provoke him a little bit that I thought Churchill [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2740.76s)]
*  was the chief villain of the second world war. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2743.76s)]
*  Now he didn't kill the most people. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2746.6800000000003s)]
*  He didn't, uh, commit the most atrocities, but I believe, and I don't really [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2748.6s)]
*  think, I think when you really get into it and tell the story right, and don't [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2753.44s)]
*  leave anything out, you see that he was primarily responsible for that war [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2757.88s)]
*  becoming what it did becoming something other than an invasion of Poland or. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2761.6400000000003s)]
*  Just, I mean, at every step of the way, like people are very often, I find [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2767.56s)]
*  surprised to learn there's a two step process. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2772.1600000000003s)]
*  Why don't you just make the case, make the case for that. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2774.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2776.88s)]
*  So you've made your statement. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2777.04s)]
*  A lot of people are thinking, well, wait a second. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2778.32s)]
*  You said Churchill, my childhood hero, the guy with the cigar. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2779.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2783.88s)]
*  Well, and the next thought that comes into their head is that, Oh, you're [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2784.56s)]
*  saying Churchill was the chief villain. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2787.72s)]
*  Therefore his enemies, you know, Adolf Hitler and so forth were. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2789.72s)]
*  Stalin the protagonist, right? [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2793.8799999999997s)]
*  That they're the good guys. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2795.3999999999996s)]
*  If you think he's a villain, that's not the case. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2796.3199999999997s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2797.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, Germany, look, they, they put themselves into a, into a position and [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2799.24s)]
*  Adolf Hitler is chiefly responsible for this, but his whole regime is responsible [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2805.0s)]
*  for it, that when they went into the East, uh, in 1941, they launched a war where [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2808.4399999999996s)]
*  they were completely unprepared to deal with the millions and millions of [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2815.6s)]
*  prisoners of war of local political prisoners and so forth that they were [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2821.2799999999997s)]
*  going to have to handle, they went in with no plan for that and they just threw [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2826.24s)]
*  these people into camps and millions of people ended up dead there. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2830.04s)]
*  You know, you have, uh, you have like letters as early as July, August, 1941 [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2833.6s)]
*  from commandants of these makeshift camps that they're setting up for these [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2840.52s)]
*  millions of people who were surrendering or people that rounding up. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2843.76s)]
*  And they're so it's two months after a month or two after Barbara Rocha was [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2846.96s)]
*  launched and they're writing back to the high command in Berlin saying, we [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2851.36s)]
*  can't feed these people, we don't have the food to feed these people. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2855.88s)]
*  And one of them actually says, rather than wait for them all to slowly [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2860.0400000000004s)]
*  starve this winter, wouldn't it be more humane to just finish them off quickly now? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2864.1200000000003s)]
*  And so this is like two months into the invasion, right? [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2869.36s)]
*  And like my view on this, uh, you know, I argue with my Zionist, uh, interlocutors [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2872.4s)]
*  about this all the time with regard to the current war in Gaza, look, man, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2878.8s)]
*  like maybe you as the Germans, you felt like you had to invade to the east. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2882.8s)]
*  Maybe you thought that Stalin was such a threat or that if he launched a surprise [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2888.7200000000003s)]
*  attack and sees the oil fields in Romania, that you would now not have the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2893.32s)]
*  fuel to actually respond and you'd be crippled and all of Europe would be under [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2897.04s)]
*  threat and whatever it was, whatever it was that like, maybe you thought you had [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2900.28s)]
*  to do that, but at the end of the day, you launched that war with no plan to care [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2904.48s)]
*  for the millions and millions of civilians and prisoners of war that were [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2909.8s)]
*  going to come under your control and millions of people died because of that. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2912.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2916.48s)]
*  And you can look at it and say, like, um, you know, there, well, yeah. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2917.28s)]
*  So it would get back to your, like your main question about Churchill. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2923.32s)]
*  You know, if you go to, uh, 1939, when the Germans and the Soviet [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2927.3999999999996s)]
*  union invade Poland, um, as soon as that war's wrapped up on the German side, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2932.2s)]
*  Hitler starts firing off peace proposals to Britain and France because they had [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2938.3999999999996s)]
*  already declared war. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2942.4399999999996s)]
*  He was, he didn't expect them to declare war actually. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2943.64s)]
*  Like there's a, you know, famous scene where he kind of throws a fit when he [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2946.12s)]
*  finds out that they actually did, that they did do that. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2949.72s)]
*  And so he doesn't want to fight France. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2953.2s)]
*  He doesn't want to fight Britain. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2954.6s)]
*  He feels that's going to weaken Europe. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2955.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, when we've got this huge threat to the East, the communist threat over there. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2957.3199999999997s)]
*  And he starts firing off peace proposals. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2962.2799999999997s)]
*  He says, let's not do this. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2964.7999999999997s)]
*  Like we can't do this. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2965.8799999999997s)]
*  And of course, you know, year goes by 1940 comes around and they're still at war. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2967.52s)]
*  And so he launches his invasion to the West, takes over France, takes [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2972.12s)]
*  over Western and Northern Europe. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2975.64s)]
*  Once that's done and the British have, uh, you know, uh, escaped at Dunkirk. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2978.16s)]
*  There's no British force left on the continent. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2983.16s)]
*  There's no opposing force left on the continent. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2985.44s)]
*  In other words, the war is over and the Germans won. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2989.6400000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2992.96s)]
*  But by, but what, by what point? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2993.96s)]
*  Uh, fall of 1940, right? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2996.76s)]
*  So there's just, there's literally no opposing force on the, on the continent. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=2999.28s)]
*  And throughout that summer, Adolf Hitler is firing off radio broadcasts, giving [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3004.32s)]
*  speeches, literally sending planes over to drop leaflets over London and other [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3009.6000000000004s)]
*  British cities, trying to get the message to these people that Germany [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3014.24s)]
*  does not want to fight you. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3017.52s)]
*  Like we don't want to fight you offering peace proposals that, you know, it said, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3019.08s)]
*  you keep all your overseas colonies. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3023.64s)]
*  We don't want any of that. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3025.6s)]
*  We want Britain to be strong. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3026.52s)]
*  The world needs Britain to be strong, you know, especially as we face this [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3027.9599999999996s)]
*  communist threat and so forth, like this, this what's going on. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3031.04s)]
*  And I think that if there were people in Britain who, uh, well, if they [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3034.72s)]
*  hadn't put it this way, if they hadn't been so successful at delegitimizing, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3039.68s)]
*  uh, the peace approach by demonizing Neville Chamberlain and so forth and [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3043.04s)]
*  holding him responsible for the invasion of Poland, um, that people would have [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3047.4s)]
*  been, they would have understood, understood, like we don't need another, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3053.08s)]
*  a repeat of the first world war, you know, we don't, which is not what ended [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3056.76s)]
*  up happening, but that's what everybody thought was going to happen. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3060.16s)]
*  And so Churchill, I mean, you have a guy who wants, Churchill wanted a war. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3063.36s)]
*  He wanted to fight Germany. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3067.68s)]
*  Uh, and the reason that I, I don't begrudge him that. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3070.08s)]
*  You know, people can come national leaders. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3072.92s)]
*  You can fight whoever you want. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3074.92s)]
*  If, you know, if you feel like you're long-term, uh, the long-term interest [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3076.0s)]
*  of the British empire threatened by the rise of a powerful continental power [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3079.96s)]
*  like Germany, and you need to check that. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3083.1600000000003s)]
*  That those are great power games and you play them the way you feel [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3085.5600000000004s)]
*  like you need to play them. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3088.44s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3089.1600000000003s)]
*  The reason I resent Churchill so much for it is that he kept this war going. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3089.96s)]
*  When he had no way, he had no way to go back and fight this war. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3094.84s)]
*  All he had were bombers. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3098.96s)]
*  He was literally by 1940 sending fire bomb fleets, sending bomber fleets [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3100.12s)]
*  to go fire bomb the black forest, just to burn down sections of the black forest. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3105.04s)]
*  Just, just rank terrorism, you know, going through and, uh, starting to, you know, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3109.24s)]
*  what eventually became just the carpet bombing, the saturation bombing [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3114.72s)]
*  of civilian neighborhoods, you know, to kill is the purpose of which was to [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3117.72s)]
*  kill as many civilians as possible. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3121.3199999999997s)]
*  And all the men were out in the field. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3123.6s)]
*  All the fighting age men were out in the field. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3124.92s)]
*  And so this is old people, it's women and children, and they knew that. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3126.56s)]
*  And they were wiping these places out as gigantic scaled terrorist attacks. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3129.2s)]
*  The greatest scale of terrorist attacks you've ever seen in world history. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3135.3999999999996s)]
*  Why would he do that? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3139.2799999999997s)]
*  Because it was the only means that they had to continue fighting at the time. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, they didn't have the ability to reinvade Europe. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3144.96s)]
*  And so he needed to keep this war going until he accomplished what is, you [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3148.3199999999997s)]
*  know, what he, what he hoped to accomplish. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3152.64s)]
*  We know now there's actually a really great series of books. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3153.9199999999996s)]
*  It's, it's one of the best. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3156.3599999999997s)]
*  I recommend to everybody, but it's really expensive now. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3158.16s)]
*  And it's six long volumes called history of British special operations [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3160.56s)]
*  in the second world war. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3164.48s)]
*  And one of the books gets into the level of just the extent of media operations, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3165.88s)]
*  propaganda operations, everything that they were running in the United States [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3173.76s)]
*  to eventually drag us into that war. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3177.2s)]
*  And that was his whole plan. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3179.92s)]
*  His whole plan was we don't, we don't have a way to fight this war ourselves. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3181.4s)]
*  This war is over. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3185.48s)]
*  We need either the Soviet Union or the United States to do it for us. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3186.72s)]
*  And that was the plan and kept the war going long enough for that plan to come [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3190.2s)]
*  to fruition and to me, that's just, it's a craven, ugly way to, to fight a war. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3194.16s)]
*  And what was the motive? [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3199.68s)]
*  Um, well, you know, Churchill's got a long and complicated history. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3204.64s)]
*  I mean, he's like, you know, he's somebody who that was the [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3208.64s)]
*  riotest smile I think I've ever seen. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3211.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3214.16s)]
*  Um, well, look, I think on one level, there was a sense that Churchill was [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3215.6s)]
*  sort of humiliated by his performance in the first world war. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3223.2799999999997s)]
*  He was the head of the Admiralty and he was out in the cold for a long time. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3226.16s)]
*  I mean, glibly. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3229.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3230.48s)]
*  And which, you know, was, that was his operation, you know? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3231.04s)]
*  And so he was rightly held responsible for that and seen as responsible for one [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3235.0s)]
*  of the great disasters that the British suffered during that war. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3239.56s)]
*  And so I think part of it was probably kind of personal, you know, he wanted [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3243.04s)]
*  redemption, he wanted to go out there and like prove that he's the warlord, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3246.4s)]
*  that they can go out there and fight this big war. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3250.2s)]
*  Um, probably. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3253.92s)]
*  I think part of it, like I read about Churchill and he strikes me as a psychopath. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3255.68s)]
*  Um, but he's also a sort of, I mean, he was a drunk, he was very [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3260.68s)]
*  childish in strange ways. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3265.24s)]
*  People would talk about how as an adult, like at, you know, as prime minister, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3266.52s)]
*  they'd find him in his room and he's like playing with action figures, like war [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3271.6s)]
*  toys and army men and stuff. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3274.72s)]
*  And we get mad when people would, uh, would interrupt him, you know, when he [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3276.24s)]
*  was doing that, this is a strange, strange fellow, you know, there's all those things. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3279.88s)]
*  Um, but then you get into, uh, you know, why was, why was Winston Churchill such [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3284.3199999999997s)]
*  a, such a dedicated booster of Zionism from early on in his life, right? [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3289.68s)]
*  And there's ideological reasons. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3296.2s)]
*  Uh, one, you know, like in 1920, he wrote a kind of infamous now article [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3298.2400000000002s)]
*  called Zionism versus Bolshevism. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3302.76s)]
*  And he basically, uh, makes the case that, which was, which was true to a large [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3305.1600000000003s)]
*  extent that all of Eastern Europe, the Pale of Settlement, which is where the [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3310.7200000000003s)]
*  vast majority of Jews lived other than the United States, which is where a lot [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3315.2400000000002s)]
*  of them had, had traveled to, um, that, that area had been, had become so engulfed [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3318.96s)]
*  by a revolutionary spirit that all the young Ashkenazi Jews who were over there [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3325.48s)]
*  were getting swept up into it. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3331.0s)]
*  It was the sixties here on steroids, right? [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3332.2400000000002s)]
*  And in a much more serious, uh, ended up being destructive way. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3335.32s)]
*  And this is 1920. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3338.36s)]
*  So this is shortly after the Bolshevik revolution. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3339.28s)]
*  Basically the point of his paper is he says these people who over there, they're [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3341.12s)]
*  all going one direction or the other. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3346.0s)]
*  They're going to be Bolsheviks. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3348.6s)]
*  They're going to be Zionists. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3350.36s)]
*  We want them to be Zionists, you know? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3351.64s)]
*  And so we need to support this. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3353.28s)]
*  And so that was early on. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3354.4s)]
*  There was an ideological component of it, but then as time goes on, you know, you [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3355.28s)]
*  read stories about Churchill going bankrupt and needing money, getting bailed [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3359.5600000000004s)]
*  out by people who shared his interests, uh, you know, in terms of Zionism, but [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3364.96s)]
*  also, uh, his hostility just, just, you know, I think his hostility to, put it [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3370.6800000000003s)]
*  this way, I think his hostility to Germany was real. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3376.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, I don't think that he necessarily had to be bribed to have that feeling. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3379.6000000000004s)]
*  Um, but, you know, I think he was to an extent put in place by, by people, the [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3385.5600000000004s)]
*  financiers by a media complex that wanted to make sure that he was the guy who, you [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3392.88s)]
*  know, uh, who was, who was representing Britain in that conflict for, for the, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3399.6000000000004s)]
*  for a reason and, um, you know, Churchill's a, uh, again, it's so hard because like, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3404.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, and especially in a short interview like this, where, uh, you have [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3413.6s)]
*  this guy who, I mean, he's a, he's an Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3417.7599999999998s)]
*  Martin Luther King, like type figure in the, in the sort of Western consciousness. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3424.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3429.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3429.56s)]
*  And so people have so many assumptions and built in triggers, like when it comes [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3430.2799999999997s)]
*  to this guy that it's hard to talk about it because you're always thinking about. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3434.68s)]
*  Uh, the triggers that you're setting off and your listeners, and I don't say that [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3439.04s)]
*  in a way of like, I don't want to offend anybody. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3442.24s)]
*  No, no, I understand. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3444.08s)]
*  It's that it's, you know, you know, that things are going to be misunderstood. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3444.8799999999997s)]
*  And so this is why I do 30 hour podcasts. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3449.3599999999997s)]
*  But it's just, it's interesting because I, you know, as a follower of your work, I [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3451.4799999999996s)]
*  don't see you as hostiles to the West. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3455.3599999999997s)]
*  I see you actually as a product of the West and as a defender really of the [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3457.72s)]
*  West or its values, um, you know, in your approach and your open mindedness, rigor, [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3461.24s)]
*  you know, belief in accuracy and honesty. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3467.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, those are Western notions. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3470.2s)]
*  Uh, and yet Churchill has been positioned and has been really is accepted as like [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3472.3599999999997s)]
*  the defender of the West over the last hundred years. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3477.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3482.24s)]
*  And so maybe that's, and I, and I wonder why that is. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3483.24s)]
*  I don't, I mean, people can certainly take issue with any factual claims you're [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3486.08s)]
*  making, I assume they're all worth it. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3490.3199999999997s)]
*  Consistent with what I think I know to be true. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3491.68s)]
*  Um, but why do you think Churchill has been presented in a way in the way that [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3495.08s)]
*  he has? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3501.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3502.16s)]
*  Well, it's, it has to do with what you said earlier, right? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3502.36s)]
*  Uh, Neville Chamberlain versus Churchill has been the binary model that has served [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3505.2s)]
*  as the chief rhetorical device for every conflict we've wanted to get into since [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3511.56s)]
*  then, you know, the entire cold war. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3516.88s)]
*  And then even after the cold war in the global war on terror is if you appease [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3518.56s)]
*  them, you're Neville Chamberlain. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3523.4s)]
*  Hitler's the, uh, rather Churchill's the one who saw all along where this was [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3524.92s)]
*  headed and was trying to warn people this, you know, Cassandra. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3529.6s)]
*  And finally, because nobody listened to him, the war ended up breaking out and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3532.8399999999997s)]
*  we were forced to like, go stamp out this threat. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3539.52s)]
*  And now it's a much bigger threat than it ever would have been if we just [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3542.48s)]
*  would have listened to him. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3545.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3545.96s)]
*  If we had strangled it in its crib. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3546.2s)]
*  And it's justified every conflict, uh, you know, really since the second world [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3547.8399999999997s)]
*  war, everybody's the new Hitler, right? [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3552.8399999999997s)]
*  It's, it's, um, and so that it's, it's very valuable in that sense, but then [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3554.52s)]
*  also, you know, it really did become the, the, the founding myth of the, of the [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3558.8s)]
*  global order that we're all living in now. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3565.6800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3567.52s)]
*  Like, cause when you think about, like, if you go back to think about like, um, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3567.92s)]
*  in Machiavelli's the Prince, right. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3572.44s)]
*  And he's, he starts that book out kind of talking about why he's writing this book. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3574.4s)]
*  And one of the things that he says in there is, you know, Italy is a bunch of [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3578.88s)]
*  broken up little principalities and states and stuff, and he's looking over [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3582.32s)]
*  to the West and the North and seeing countries like Spain, countries like [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3586.08s)]
*  France and England who like, these are, these are countries that are now starting [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3589.36s)]
*  to operate on a totally different scale, like on a national, something [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3594.04s)]
*  that's a national scale. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3597.56s)]
*  Um, and we have, have got to get it, get it, get our act together and start [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3599.16s)]
*  learning how to act on that, on that level as well. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3603.12s)]
*  And so that's why I'm writing this book. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3605.88s)]
*  It's an instruction manual and like a call to action kind of. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3607.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, as that goes on and the nation state starts to put itself together [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3611.0s)]
*  in the, in the modern era, you know, you, you get to world war one and you think [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3615.7999999999997s)]
*  about what the nation state is, right? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3621.9199999999996s)]
*  Like history and to a large extent glow, like sort of global event style. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3623.52s)]
*  History is governed to, to, to a great degree by the military technology [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3627.08s)]
*  that's prevalent at a given time. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3632.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3633.96s)]
*  So like, I don't think it's, it's an accident, for example, that, um, the [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3634.24s)]
*  ancient Greeks had like an equal, a feeling of like citizen equality, um, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3639.9199999999996s)]
*  that was unprecedented at the world at the time. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3645.2s)]
*  And they had the, their chief combat system was the phalanx unit that required [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3647.16s)]
*  every man to stand by his, you know, his fellow citizen as a unit. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3653.04s)]
*  And they, that's what their, uh, position in the world depended on [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3657.56s)]
*  people being able to do that. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3662.56s)]
*  I don't think that's a mistake, right? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3663.72s)]
*  And I don't think it's a mistake when you look at other societies where, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3665.0s)]
*  uh, charioteers, you know, really expensive branch chariots, or, uh, when, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3668.0s)]
*  when you get to like, uh, uh, the high middle ages where the heavy horse [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3673.16s)]
*  cavalry is just totally dominant on the battlefield, but the, you know, so [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3677.24s)]
*  only the people who can afford that kind of a weapon system, they're the ones [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3682.12s)]
*  who are going to rule and the people who don't like it, they really don't have [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3685.08s)]
*  any means to, to, uh, you know, sort of express, um, their, their, their [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3687.6s)]
*  own, uh, political will. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3692.56s)]
*  And so as the nation state starts to get put together, you start to have, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3695.3599999999997s)]
*  you start to have military, uh, conflicts and just military buildups on a scale [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3700.0s)]
*  that nobody's ever heard of before. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3704.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, you're talking, you get to the first world war, I mean, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3706.0s)]
*  millions and millions of men. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3709.04s)]
*  And if you want to operate on that level, if you want to operate on the level of [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3710.3599999999997s)]
*  great game global politics, you got to be able to put an army of several [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3714.8799999999997s)]
*  million men in the field, you know? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3719.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's, it's why countries who tried their hand at, uh, at imperialism, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3721.12s)]
*  like the Dutch and the Belgians, you know, eventually they were just like, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3725.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, we're not doing it. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3729.2s)]
*  And, um, it's because they saw that. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3730.8399999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, when you look at the first world war and the second world war, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3732.96s)]
*  but really the first world war is like the apotheosis of the nation state in a [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3736.8399999999997s)]
*  lot of ways where you have, you know, if you, if you think back to like an old [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3740.56s)]
*  king in the early modern period or even, no, forget about that. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3745.08s)]
*  Look at like Louis the 14th. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3749.3199999999997s)]
*  So the sun king, right. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3751.2s)]
*  Powerful as any Monarch in Europe, like for hundreds of years, his actual [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3752.7999999999997s)]
*  ability to reach into the local affairs of some village and tell people how to [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3758.88s)]
*  act or what to think. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3763.7200000000003s)]
*  Pretty limited. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3765.2000000000003s)]
*  Very limited. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3766.1600000000003s)]
*  Like we, we think, you know, because of movies in TV that a Monarch is sitting [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3767.12s)]
*  on his throne and he just orders this and it happens, like God's saying, let [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3771.6400000000003s)]
*  there be light or something. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3775.88s)]
*  But had him. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3776.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3777.48s)]
*  And it's just, they didn't have that kind of reach, you know, they had [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3777.96s)]
*  influence and they had, but they had like, like any modern, uh, individual [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  politician, they had to work through existing structures and systems to get [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3785.88s)]
*  their will actually carried out. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3789.36s)]
*  And that meant making compromises and they just didn't have the resources to [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3792.08s)]
*  like, you know, technological resources, but also just human and financial [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3796.12s)]
*  resources to get down to the granular level of control that would become common [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3800.7200000000003s)]
*  when with the rise of the nation state. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3806.44s)]
*  And so you get up to the point where, you know, when, when, when the nations face [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3808.2000000000003s)]
*  off in world war one and you have countries that, I mean, when you look at [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3811.52s)]
*  the, the, the, the level of efficient mobilization toward a single cause, uh, [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3817.48s)]
*  you know, fighting the war, how the economy, how the government, everybody [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3825.36s)]
*  was on the same page and, you know, they were fighting this war as whole societies. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3832.12s)]
*  Like they, they figured out a way that they could do what Louis the 14th could [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3836.68s)]
*  never dream of. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3840.84s)]
*  They could mobilize their whole society for war. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3841.52s)]
*  And that was what you had to do if you wanted to compete on the level of Germany [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3845.6000000000004s)]
*  and France and so forth. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3850.28s)]
*  And so what somebody like Churchill during the first world war and probably [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3852.48s)]
*  actually the second world war as well, most people, I think players in the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3856.7200000000003s)]
*  second world war, what they thought they were doing was that this was a war [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3861.92s)]
*  between nation states like world war one and so on and so forth. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3865.56s)]
*  It was not that we found out afterwards that it was not that, that there were two, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3870.2s)]
*  uh, great military land empires, multi-ethnic, multi-racial, uh, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3874.44s)]
*  multicultural military land empires, the Soviet union, the United States, uh, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3878.84s)]
*  that, and when I say empire, obviously, like we don't think of the U S pre world [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3884.64s)]
*  war two in that way very much, but you know, we didn't start out with a whole [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3888.92s)]
*  continent under our control, right? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3893.2s)]
*  We started out as 13 colonies and we grew through, uh, a confrontation with [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3895.2s)]
*  and, uh, centuries long race war against the natives, right? [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3901.68s)]
*  I mean, that's, that's really, that was the formative experience of, of, of [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3906.0s)]
*  America in its early history. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3909.92s)]
*  And so that's an empire in a way, you know, not the way we normally like the, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3912.3599999999997s)]
*  it's not like the British empire, but I think you can call it that. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3915.12s)]
*  And you know, these two countries, that thing that Machiavelli was noticing [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3918.7999999999997s)]
*  when he's looking over at Spain and France, you actually had like Germany, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3923.2s)]
*  for example, there's this idea that the only reason that they did Molotov [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3926.72s)]
*  Ribbentrop was because, you know, Hitler needed to buy time so he could eventually [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3930.44s)]
*  invade the Soviet union later or something like that. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3934.64s)]
*  Um, not exactly true. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3937.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, that obviously was talking about the eventual conflict with the [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3939.3199999999997s)]
*  Soviet union very early in his career that was there. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3942.56s)]
*  But by the time you get up to like 1939, his views are starting to become more [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3945.52s)]
*  complicated on it, where he's starting to see the United States as the chief, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3949.04s)]
*  the real chief threat to not just to Germany, but to Europe, because he saw [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3954.08s)]
*  himself as the sort of European defender of Messiah guy, right? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3957.44s)]
*  So, and he looks over at Joseph Stalin and says, you know, a lot of his people [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3961.96s)]
*  kind of thought this way, that this is not an international communist movement [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3967.2s)]
*  anymore. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3971.88s)]
*  Like Trotsky's been banned, banished from the country and his [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3972.44s)]
*  followers are all dead. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3976.0s)]
*  You know, they were killed during the purges of the late thirties. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3977.4399999999996s)]
*  These people are all, are all gone. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3980.3599999999997s)]
*  Those are all of the people who, you know, from the very beginning, after the first [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3982.52s)]
*  world war, they saw Russia as the fountainhead of world revolution. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3987.24s)]
*  And Stalin, he never quite gave that up, you know, just like the United States, he [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3992.72s)]
*  saw it as his, uh, as his duty to build up ideologically aligned allies and so [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=3996.9199999999996s)]
*  forth. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4002.96s)]
*  But if you really look at what happened in the, a lot of the Germans saw it this [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4003.2799999999997s)]
*  way, you know, Stalin, what he did was kind of turn the Soviet union into like a [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4007.52s)]
*  national socialist nation state, really, you know, he kind of brought back to [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4011.6s)]
*  Russian empire and now it's called communist and stuff, but there's no goal [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4015.04s)]
*  to just set off global revolution. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4019.3599999999997s)]
*  And then once that happens, the chips will follow where it fall, where they [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4021.68s)]
*  may. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4024.4399999999996s)]
*  They kept inside the Kremlin, they kept all the paintings of St. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4024.7599999999998s)]
*  George, the patron saint of Russia, all the crosses, they, they, the whole [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4028.4399999999996s)]
*  Stalin period, they're there. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4032.08s)]
*  And I have, I mean, I have nothing good to say about Stalin. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4033.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't either, but I don't, I don't think it's been mis-advertised a little [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4036.56s)]
*  bit. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4039.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4039.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4040.2799999999997s)]
*  And when I, earlier, when I said that there's one episode that I have done [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4040.64s)]
*  where I feel like I didn't do my duty to force myself to understand the [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4043.84s)]
*  perspective of the perpetrators. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4047.6s)]
*  It was the one that I did about the Soviet conquest of Eastern Europe after [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4050.04s)]
*  the second world war and what they did in Germany and other places and, and [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4054.88s)]
*  specifically Romania, which is. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4058.2799999999997s)]
*  As far as I can tell, like so far after 30 years of reading history books is [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4061.0s)]
*  pretty much the worst thing that ever happened. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4064.8799999999997s)]
*  These, these prison experiments that they ran in Pitesci and other places in [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4067.3999999999996s)]
*  Romania after the second world war are, that's not family listening. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4072.2s)]
*  If you really want to. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4077.08s)]
*  The Soviets did. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4078.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4079.24s)]
*  The Soviet Soviet advisors were there. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4079.52s)]
*  It was carried out technically by the security and the Romanians themselves. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4081.12s)]
*  But, but you know, this was a, it was a program being run from Moscow, right? [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4084.7999999999997s)]
*  And it's whatever you're thinking it is out there, whoever's listening or watching [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4090.56s)]
*  this, it's a thousand times worse. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4095.12s)]
*  And I wouldn't recommend going and listening to my episode, the anti humans. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4096.76s)]
*  Um, unless, unless you're prepared for that. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4100.4s)]
*  So I'll just leave it at that, but I'll say like in that one, like I just [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4103.16s)]
*  couldn't, I couldn't bring myself to put, I couldn't put myself in the shoes of, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4106.36s)]
*  uh, of the people who were doing those things. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4111.88s)]
*  And I didn't really try and it comes across much more polemical [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4114.76s)]
*  than any of my other work. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4118.2s)]
*  And a lot of people love it because it does, you know, expose a lot of the [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4119.639999999999s)]
*  crimes that happened during that period and stuff, but I think it's hard sometimes. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4122.4s)]
*  I'll tell you one thing as a, I'm not a Stalin expert. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4126.48s)]
*  I don't speak Russian, but I have read about Stalin my whole life. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4129.84s)]
*  And one thing that I was very surprised to learn that it came out right after [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4132.0s)]
*  the, um, everything collapsed in 91 and the British historian, um, a Russian [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4136.92s)]
*  speaker got access to a lot of the Stalin archives, the personal archives. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4144.12s)]
*  And I was amazed to read in this book, quarter, the Reds are amazing book. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4148.84s)]
*  That is a great book. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4155.08s)]
*  It is a great book, but the thing that it overturned, I'm older than you. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4155.96s)]
*  So maybe you always do this, but growing up, we didn't, everyone thought [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4159.48s)]
*  Stalin was this bloodless technocrat. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4162.639999999999s)]
*  Not a true believer at all. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4165.4s)]
*  That was Lenin was certainly Trotsky seemed like a true believer. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4166.5599999999995s)]
*  Zinoviev Kamenev, you know, all the guys around him might've been, but he was not. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4170.24s)]
*  And you learn and read that. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4175.36s)]
*  So he was actually a devout, like religious level communist, which either [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4176.64s)]
*  makes him more repulsive or less depending. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4181.04s)]
*  I don't, I don't, I could see it from either side, but it's definitely [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4184.200000000001s)]
*  not what we thought he was. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4188.320000000001s)]
*  And what I loved about that was your view of something. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4189.56s)]
*  It's a small thing, I guess, for most people was a big thing for me to learn that. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4193.280000000001s)]
*  But your whole kind of accepted view of something can turn out to be utterly false. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4197.12s)]
*  Like a lot of history is just completely fake. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4202.240000000001s)]
*  And so when you see someone who's diving in face first with like courage and [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4205.28s)]
*  honesty, you just have to applaud. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4209.16s)]
*  That's why I'm just applaud. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4211.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't wait to find out what you conclude. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4212.28s)]
*  We want to announce something big that we've been working on for months now. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4216.76s)]
*  It's a documentary series called art of the surge. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4219.64s)]
*  It's all behind the scene footage shot by an embedded team that has never [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4222.76s)]
*  before seen footage of what it's actually like to run for president. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4228.0s)]
*  If you're Donald Trump, they were there at the Butler township [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4231.400000000001s)]
*  assassination attempt, for example, and got footage that no one has ever seen [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4234.12s)]
*  before, and it's amazing. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4237.72s)]
*  Become a member at Tucker Carlson.com to see this series art of the surge. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4239.8s)]
*  Where are you by the way, in this process? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4246.12s)]
*  Well, I'm currently working on a series. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4247.8s)]
*  I'm about probably going to do two more episodes on it on the history of the [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4250.28s)]
*  American labor movement. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4254.24s)]
*  It's not a, it's not a narrative history of the entire labor movement. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4255.2s)]
*  I pick certain episodes. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4258.0s)]
*  I talk about the battle of Blair mountain and one episode. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4259.84s)]
*  Um, do one on the, the hay market affair. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4262.68s)]
*  And really it's about the industrial wars of like the late 18th century from [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4264.96s)]
*  Pittsburgh to Chicago and everything. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4270.2s)]
*  Um, I did one on, uh, this 1968 teachers, uh, union strike in New York city. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4271.76s)]
*  That's kind of famous now, the ocean Hill Brownsville. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4278.5599999999995s)]
*  And, you know, that was one that a lot of my research for the Jonestown [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4281.76s)]
*  podcast about the great migration of African-Americans out of the [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4285.24s)]
*  South came in really handy. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4288.28s)]
*  Um, because really what it's about is, you know, the, the, it was a conflict [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4290.12s)]
*  in, uh, the New York's political system, like that centered around a school in [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4294.32s)]
*  Brooklyn, um, at a time when, you know, 75% of the teachers in New York city [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4300.28s)]
*  were Jewish and, you know, New York is, it's such an interesting city for the, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4306.12s)]
*  you know, for the, for the fact that, you know, it's obviously this, this [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4311.719999999999s)]
*  multi-ethnic, multi-cultural city that over the years just, you know, is where [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4315.36s)]
*  everybody washed up for the most part on our shores and from the Irish migrations [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4319.88s)]
*  to the Jewish and Italian migrations and everybody that came after that, there [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4325.2s)]
*  were, there was conflict and people had to figure out and eventually come to a [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4329.5199999999995s)]
*  settlement of like, how are we going to live here together and all feel like we [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4332.719999999999s)]
*  are being represented and so forth. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4336.0s)]
*  And so you had this city where again, like today, this sounds almost, uh, it's, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4337.5199999999995s)]
*  it sounds like a different world in some ways where, you know, the teachers were [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4343.24s)]
*  pretty much all Jews, the transit workers, pretty much all Irish, the cops [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4347.28s)]
*  are mostly Irish, the firemen were mostly Irish, most of the construction [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4352.28s)]
*  trade, the dock workers, things like that. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4356.28s)]
*  They were all Italians and everybody kind of, it wasn't something like that's [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4358.36s)]
*  what they gravitated to sanitation to sanitation. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4361.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4364.88s)]
*  But that was their economic territory and they had certain neighborhoods that [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4365.08s)]
*  were theirs and people kind of knew that it's not like a, you know, a Jew couldn't [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4369.36s)]
*  move into an Italian neighborhood or vice versa or something. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4374.08s)]
*  Um, but everybody knew that this was an Italian neighborhood and it was [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4376.799999999999s)]
*  going to stay that way. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4379.5599999999995s)]
*  And they had all kind of come to this settlement in a natural way. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4380.48s)]
*  Like it just, it was an emergent order that came over the years. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4383.24s)]
*  And when, uh, and again, there was conflict at every stage of that. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4387.04s)]
*  Um, after the 1924 immigration law that essentially cut off European immigration [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4391.679999999999s)]
*  and generally, uh, your immigration in general, um, the cheap source of labor [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4398.28s)]
*  that industry turned to were African-Americans from the South. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4404.44s)]
*  And so you saw over the course of about 40 or 50 years, about six or seven [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4407.5599999999995s)]
*  million African-Americans move out of the rural South to the Northern and Western [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4412.44s)]
*  cities. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4416.92s)]
*  And it turned out when they got up there that they had a lot of the same problems [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4417.4s)]
*  that they had had previously. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4421.92s)]
*  Um, but for, you know, various reasons, I think personally, the fact that, uh, we [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4424.36s)]
*  were in the post second world war period and we were in the middle of a cold war. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4430.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, that, you know, the, the process of integrating these people into the system [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4436.24s)]
*  as one of several, uh, you know, cause this was a great dream. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4441.759999999999s)]
*  If you read, um, what's the, what's the book, uh, Nathan Glazer and, uh, it's [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4445.88s)]
*  beyond the melting pot that he wrote. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4451.36s)]
*  And, um, they, in, in the, I think they wrote that in 1971 and what they predicted [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4453.5199999999995s)]
*  in that book was Moynihan and Glazer. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4459.0s)]
*  That's what it was. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4460.599999999999s)]
*  And, uh, they predicted in that book that, yeah, there's a lot of problems right [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4461.16s)]
*  now integrating the African-American and Puerto Rican populations into the, into [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4463.96s)]
*  the city, but what we're going to do, like, eventually this has always happened. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4467.719999999999s)]
*  It's happened in the past. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4471.96s)]
*  Eventually it's not going to be black and white like it seems right now. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4473.16s)]
*  It's going to be Italian and Jewish and Puerto Rican and black. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4476.719999999999s)]
*  And so they're going to take their place as one of the ethnicities, like in the [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4480.28s)]
*  sort of urban, uh, political structure and social structure we have here. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4483.24s)]
*  And when they look back on it, and I think it was maybe a 2012 edition, they [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4486.719999999999s)]
*  sort of recognized that that was obviously a, um, you know, a prediction [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4491.639999999999s)]
*  that, that did not come true. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4495.88s)]
*  Um, they, you know, they, they sort of, they, they get into that. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4498.48s)]
*  And so, um, but this, the teacher strike, um, of 1968 was like, first of all, it [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4501.84s)]
*  was, at least in my reading of it, one of the pretty rare expressions of mass and [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4513.16s)]
*  open anti-Semitism, anti-Semitism, of course, but, but, but like for real in [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4519.08s)]
*  American history, it doesn't seem to be remembered for some reason. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4524.2s)]
*  No, it's, it's remembered or misremembered, like right alongside the [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4527.5599999999995s)]
*  Crown Heights riot and things like that. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4531.4s)]
*  Um, because, you know, it's one of those things. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4533.92s)]
*  Look, I, I lived for a long time in Los Angeles, right? [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4536.12s)]
*  Um, I used to live in South LA when those were all black neighborhoods down there. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4539.44s)]
*  And you, people think back to the Rodney King riots or when they were watching [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4543.8s)]
*  the fresh Prince of Bel Air or something, and he would go visit his friends down [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4548.12s)]
*  in Compton and those were the black neighborhoods down there. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4551.32s)]
*  Those are not black neighborhoods. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4554.12s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4555.24s)]
*  Those are all Latino neighborhoods and that transition was not accomplished [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4556.0s)]
*  peacefully, you know, there were, and there are, there are good studies and [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4559.32s)]
*  write-ups about this, um, hundreds and hundreds of random murders of black [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4563.28s)]
*  people by, uh, Mexican gangs, fire bombings of apartment buildings, um, to [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4568.92s)]
*  drive these people out, right? [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4574.679999999999s)]
*  Now you, you look at some drive them east. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4576.36s)]
*  That's kind of, you know, if you look at all the big cities in California, even [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4579.16s)]
*  like up in Oakland and stuff, they're all losing their black population and the [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4582.84s)]
*  great migration out of the South to these cities is actually in reverse right now. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4586.5199999999995s)]
*  A lot like net African-Americans are moving back to the South and [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4590.04s)]
*  into the Indian empire or just like away from the coast. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4594.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4598.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4598.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4598.92s)]
*  Well that's right. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4599.04s)]
*  That's what happens. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4599.88s)]
*  Like a lot of, but it's a step-by-step process, right? [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4600.36s)]
*  They get priced out of Oakland and San Francisco and they moved to [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4602.84s)]
*  Stockton and Sacramento and then those places go up to, and they end up [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4605.28s)]
*  moving, you know, further inland. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4608.96s)]
*  And that's a process that's been going on for a long time, but like, you look [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4610.92s)]
*  at what happened in, in Los Angeles. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4614.2s)]
*  I mean, again, you're talking about hundreds and hundreds of random [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4616.08s)]
*  murders, fire bombings, just not of other gang members or something. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4618.36s)]
*  I'm not talking about drive-bys of other gang members. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4622.24s)]
*  I'm talking about just a random black guy. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4624.28s)]
*  Race killings. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4627.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4627.84s)]
*  Race killing people because of the color of their skin. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4628.04s)]
*  And if those people had been, you know, who were doing that, were wearing [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4629.679999999999s)]
*  white hoods, they would have called the U S Marines in and for good reason. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4632.0s)]
*  You know, but it's one of those things that nobody wants to talk about [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4634.84s)]
*  because it doesn't fit neatly into one of our easy political. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4638.28s)]
*  So that's what bothers me about the recording of history. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4642.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I think it, what happens matters. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4644.88s)]
*  Reality matters. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4647.400000000001s)]
*  And if you find that sort of everything that happens, not just 80 years ago in [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4649.400000000001s)]
*  Dresden, but things that are happening in like LA County 20 years ago, if they [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4653.88s)]
*  just disappear, you know, in some cases you can't even find them on Google. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4658.84s)]
*  Like that's a level of manipulation. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4663.64s)]
*  That's like, that's just mind control. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4665.36s)]
*  That's, that's really scary. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4667.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4669.4400000000005s)]
*  And I think the propagandists throughout the 20th century, uh, ever since the, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4669.64s)]
*  sort of the rise of mass media, I've really understood that that's exactly what it [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4673.92s)]
*  is, you know, especially once it goes on for a generation or two and kids are [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4676.92s)]
*  raised up, uh, and this is what they're being taught because it, it, it, it, it, [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4682.52s)]
*  forms for them, uh, their, their, not just their view of the world, but [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4689.360000000001s)]
*  their view of themselves, like our identities as individuals and our [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4694.320000000001s)]
*  identities that we attach ourselves to collectively are all a result of the [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4698.0s)]
*  stories we tell ourselves and that we hear as we're growing up. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4701.48s)]
*  And so if you change those stories, all of those things change as well. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4704.36s)]
*  Okay. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4708.4s)]
*  So that's a perfect segue to something I'm just itching to talk to you about [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4708.599999999999s)]
*  itching to get your view on. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4711.5199999999995s)]
*  And that leads us back to Churchill. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4713.639999999999s)]
*  So Churchill is this great hero, defender of the West, savior of the West, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4714.919999999999s)]
*  the toughest man in the, in world history, the only reason we're not speaking [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4720.24s)]
*  German and he won the second world war. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4724.36s)]
*  Like that's what, ask anybody. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4728.32s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4729.679999999999s)]
*  And yet if I go to his country, like regularly, and it's, you know, it doesn't [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4731.639999999999s)]
*  really even exist in any recognized, which totally degraded, I try not to go [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4738.04s)]
*  there because it's so depressing. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4743.24s)]
*  It's just so sad. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4744.4s)]
*  It's so broken. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4744.959999999999s)]
*  It's not the country of victors. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4745.639999999999s)]
*  It's the, it's a defeat, completely defeated country that's subsequently been [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4747.879999999999s)]
*  invaded. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4751.679999999999s)]
*  Um, and so how, like, how did that happen? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4752.5599999999995s)]
*  How did I go to Japan and it's full of self-respect and order and [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4756.12s)]
*  plainliness and like, it doesn't look like it lost. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4761.32s)]
*  It's like, what is that? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4763.12s)]
*  Well, I think we ran a, we ran an experiment, uh, that tells us pretty well [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4764.0s)]
*  what that is. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4769.2s)]
*  And we didn't know we were running the experiment at the time, but you had the [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4769.84s)]
*  Iron Curtain set up and all the countries behind it, uh, that were not. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4772.92s)]
*  Exposed to incessant American world order, uh, Western propaganda for 70 years. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4779.08s)]
*  Um, they all, they don't have these same problems. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4785.84s)]
*  You go to Hungary, even a place like Poland, which obviously the leadership [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4788.44s)]
*  class of any of these countries is, you know, all you always have to be suspicious [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4792.0s)]
*  of them because, you know, they, they, even Romania, which is, you said, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4796.04s)]
*  suffered more than most countries. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4799.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4801.5199999999995s)]
*  And so, but those countries, like they don't mind. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4801.92s)]
*  And again, the, the tippy top leadership class might be one thing. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4805.24s)]
*  You know, somebody went to the London school of economics or something, but [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4808.32s)]
*  like taking NATO money, the people have no problems saying, no, this is a country. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4811.0s)]
*  This is Hungary. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4815.16s)]
*  This is a country for Hungarians. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4815.759999999999s)]
*  This is a Christian country. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4817.759999999999s)]
*  This is our country. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4819.2s)]
*  They don't have a problem saying that. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4821.08s)]
*  That is not something that anybody who asked to the Iron Curtain for the [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4822.92s)]
*  most part is comfortable loosening up a little bit, thank God, but you know, the [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4826.24s)]
*  question is whether it's loosening up too late, you go to a place like, like [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4831.12s)]
*  Britain, go to a place like Germany. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4836.04s)]
*  I mean, there's no country on planet earth that is, has been subjected to, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4837.799999999999s)]
*  uh, a more pervasive and destructive psychological warfare campaign than [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4843.24s)]
*  Germany over the course of the cold war. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4848.64s)]
*  I mean, these people have very, just, I mean, they're, they're, you, you [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4850.4800000000005s)]
*  really hope that it's not the case, but you wonder if, uh, if there's even the [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4855.96s)]
*  material that would be necessary to construct a psychological defense of, [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4861.6s)]
*  of their nation and their people. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4865.88s)]
*  And the lesson that we took from world war two, and again, this wouldn't have [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4867.88s)]
*  been the lesson that any of our soldiers who stormed the beaches in Normandy [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4872.16s)]
*  would have taken or anything like that. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4875.32s)]
*  But you know, the official kind of court history lesson is that when Europeans [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4876.44s)]
*  start thinking in terms of group, they're very dangerous and that process needs [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4883.16s)]
*  to be subverted, it needs to be eventually eliminated, like the [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4890.04s)]
*  possibility for that to happen again. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4894.04s)]
*  But just Europeans, not Asians or Africans? [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4895.72s)]
*  Well, uh, I, you know, I think, well, there's a lot of elements to that. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4899.24s)]
*  I mean, part of it is, part of it is the, the people that were victimized, um, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4903.28s)]
*  during the second world war were not victimized by, uh, Africans. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4910.16s)]
*  You know, people were obviously Chinese people were victimized by the [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4914.799999999999s)]
*  Japanese, but that's a, it's a different, you know, China's, China's got a very [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4918.759999999999s)]
*  powerful immune system that kind of preserves them as, uh, as a, as a culture. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4923.4s)]
*  So does Japan. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4928.08s)]
*  And so does Japan. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4928.88s)]
*  Um, and so that's, you know, there's a little, little, little bit different. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4929.88s)]
*  Um, but from a Western perspective, I think it's fair to say, our leaders [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4932.24s)]
*  make the case implicitly that it's really only when Europeans have a sense of [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4936.32s)]
*  themselves as Europeans that the world is in peril, but everyone else is fine to do that. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4940.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4946.2s)]
*  I mean, you know, that's, uh, they, they don't see those other people as a threat. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4946.6s)]
*  You know, either because the people who formulate these narratives don't live in [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4951.52s)]
*  those places or they don't have historical experience with those people. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4955.28s)]
*  And so they don't see them as the same kind of threat. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4959.16s)]
*  Uh, so Germany is totally self hating place. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4961.759999999999s)]
*  It's a husk. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4966.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4967.44s)]
*  Um, it's depressing as hell though. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4968.0s)]
*  Also wonderful in a way, but it's going away, but they lost, at least you [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4970.88s)]
*  could say they lost two world wars in a row. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4975.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4978.48s)]
*  Britain won two world wars in a row. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4979.12s)]
*  And if anything, it's more degraded than Germany. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4982.36s)]
*  So like, uh, just to take it back to the first thing I said, and I'll shut up and [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4984.6s)]
*  let you answer, but if Churchill is a hero, how come there are British girls begging [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4988.08s)]
*  for drugs on the street of London and the places, you know, it's just there. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4993.96s)]
*  London is not majority English now. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=4999.96s)]
*  Like what? [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5002.08s)]
*  Well, the people who formulated the version of history that considers [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5003.120000000001s)]
*  Churchill a hero, uh, they like London the way it is now, you know, and. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5006.4400000000005s)]
*  But that's not victory. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5011.240000000001s)]
*  That's like the worst kind of defeat. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5012.32s)]
*  Is it not? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5014.28s)]
*  I'm just confused. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5014.679999999999s)]
*  If you're an English person who cares about England, then yeah, absolutely it is. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5015.599999999999s)]
*  Um, I mean, it's, it's forget about victory and defeat. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5018.96s)]
*  It's the worst thing that can happen. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5022.44s)]
*  You know, if you look at what's going on over lately in, uh, in England, where [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5024.16s)]
*  you're having riots, you're having these, you know, sort of budding violent [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5028.5599999999995s)]
*  confrontations between nationalists and the police and so forth, which, um, you [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5033.759999999999s)]
*  know, I think our natural, we like order, right? [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5039.04s)]
*  Like Europeans, we like order order. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5042.8s)]
*  And we see things like that. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5044.92s)]
*  And we have a natural aversion to disorder, to street violence. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5045.96s)]
*  We might be, um, you know, war might be necessary, but disorderly mob violence, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5050.56s)]
*  things like that, like immediately make us kind of take a step back. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5055.28s)]
*  Cause most of our experience with those things really bad. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5058.2s)]
*  And, and at the end of the day, like it is an unleashing of evil spirits, no [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5061.08s)]
*  matter what the cause is or the reason is. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5064.6s)]
*  Um, and yet when I look over there at what the British people, some of them [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5067.4800000000005s)]
*  are trying to do, I, I, I kind of, I refuse to judge them for, uh, whatever, [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5071.4800000000005s)]
*  for doing whatever it is that they feel they have to do as their homeland, their [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5080.52s)]
*  ancient homeland is being taken from them. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5085.6s)]
*  Because that is not something that can be walked back. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5089.04s)]
*  That is permanent. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5091.320000000001s)]
*  That is something that ends your existence as a people. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5092.92s)]
*  Like, unless you're going to be like the Jews and, uh, you know, go off into [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5096.32s)]
*  exile and sort of manage to maintain yourself and even the Jews, they [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5099.8s)]
*  understood that they needed a little spot somewhere on earth that was their [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5104.0s)]
*  special place to develop their culture and to work things, work out their history [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5108.32s)]
*  among themselves as a community of people. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5112.8s)]
*  And the English people are having that taken from them. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5115.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, the Irish people, Ireland is on track to be minority Irish by like [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5119.12s)]
*  2070 and you say, okay, hang on. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5125.12s)]
*  Like, a, they never colonized anybody. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5128.24s)]
*  B, they were colonized and like got the really nasty end of that. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5131.36s)]
*  A lot of the time, uh, you know, suffered a lot. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5135.76s)]
*  They fought for hundreds of years against brutal, uh, British attempts to [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  try to bring them into the British fold and squash that uniqueness, you know, [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5145.2s)]
*  that they had out there, the British couldn't do it and the British for a [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5149.28s)]
*  while there could do damn near anything. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5153.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5155.5199999999995s)]
*  And he spent a lot of time trying to impress Ireland a lot. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5156.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5159.679999999999s)]
*  And it was a, I mean, not only that it was a, it was a chief priority for a [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5160.12s)]
*  lot of time, and you know, we have a, we have a bit of a skewed view of the [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5164.28s)]
*  British empire just because, and I, and there are a lot of things that are [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5171.639999999999s)]
*  glorious and wonderful about the British empire, but the United States, like we [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5173.92s)]
*  don't quite understand like the way the, you know, how bad it was to fall on the [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5177.32s)]
*  wrong side of the empire because they really treated us with kid gloves during [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5181.8s)]
*  the revolution, you know, that we had half a parliament that were on our side. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5185.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5190.2s)]
*  That's what, you know, they could have done to us. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5191.320000000001s)]
*  They created the concentration camp. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5193.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5195.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5195.76s)]
*  And they ran a lot of them during world war two, actually. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5196.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5198.76s)]
*  That's another thing. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5198.84s)]
*  It's actually pretty awful is, uh, you know, as soon as the war broke out, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5199.4800000000005s)]
*  Churchill had all of the German and Italian nationals in Great Britain, all [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5204.68s)]
*  rounded up and thrown into concentration camps where they would stay to the end [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5209.8s)]
*  of the war, this is 1939 and a huge number of those people were Jewish [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5213.400000000001s)]
*  refugees who had come over from Germany to England. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5218.16s)]
*  They were just rounded up and thrown in camps for six years. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5220.84s)]
*  And he also had the opposition party thrown in prison for the duration, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5224.08s)]
*  Oswald Mosley and his wife, uh, right after giving birth, you know, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5226.72s)]
*  spent the duration people died. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5230.68s)]
*  Um, that doesn't look like democracy to me. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5233.04s)]
*  Are you saying that Zelensky is not running a democracy? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5235.92s)]
*  I'm saying if you don't have elections and you're throwing priests in jail, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5238.72s)]
*  if you're murdering people who disagree with you as he has, you know, you call [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5241.96s)]
*  whatever that's like basically a pretty constant form of government throughout [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5246.12s)]
*  history is fine. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5249.12s)]
*  I mean, that's like less barbaric than most forms of government [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5250.2s)]
*  actually through history. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5252.68s)]
*  It's not democracy. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5253.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5254.76s)]
*  So please don't lecture me anymore about that. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5255.16s)]
*  Well, I mean, we've seen this in the United States, even obviously a much [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5257.52s)]
*  smaller scale crisis, um, although maybe not, maybe it is an existential crisis [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5260.84s)]
*  for the people who are making the decisions, but ever since 2016, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5265.4400000000005s)]
*  where democracy is great. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5269.2s)]
*  We love democracy, but that's for normal times. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5271.2s)]
*  It's not for world war II. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5274.240000000001s)]
*  It's not for when we've got insurrections going on. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5276.320000000001s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, you've got to take extraordinary measures that may [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5278.88s)]
*  not be democratic, but it's to preserve them. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5282.72s)]
*  It's always the excuse, right? [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5284.92s)]
*  It's the excuse of every always. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5286.0s)]
*  It was Lincoln's excuse. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5287.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5288.84s)]
*  But can I just say, so the, what's happened to, uh, the UK and Ireland [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5289.6s)]
*  is not accidental. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5298.200000000001s)]
*  Is there any evidence that the people of those countries whose ancestors have [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5300.6s)]
*  lived there for thousands of years or the indigenous peoples of those [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5304.76s)]
*  countries, that they wanted this? [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5308.360000000001s)]
*  They wanted to be, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5309.92s)]
*  I mean, certainly not the majority of the people who live there, right? [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5311.400000000001s)]
*  Obviously, like you can go to any Western country, the most just, you know, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5314.84s)]
*  degraded cucked country you can possibly find in the West and the majority of [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5320.360000000001s)]
*  people there don't want any of that happening to them. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5324.84s)]
*  This is something that has a class element to it. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5327.2s)]
*  It has, uh, as these countries have become more multi-ethnic and multicultural, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5329.96s)]
*  it has, um, ethnic, you know, elements to it. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5333.92s)]
*  It's like, there's a lot of things that create a sort of a class of people. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5336.679999999999s)]
*  And it's a class of people who have most of the influence and power who [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5341.679999999999s)]
*  actually do want these things because they don't identify with the people [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5345.44s)]
*  who are against it on the ground. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5349.36s)]
*  And this is something that if you see in the United, you know, we've seen in the [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5350.679999999999s)]
*  United States in the West in general, that was budding already. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5353.16s)]
*  I mean, I would say personally, it goes all the way back to the foundation, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5356.6s)]
*  but like definitely you see in like the 1960s, if you think of somebody [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5359.4800000000005s)]
*  like John Lindsay, right? [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5362.52s)]
*  John Lindsay was the mayor of New York for a while and he was sort of the [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5364.4800000000005s)]
*  quintessential, he didn't grow up like super rich, old money. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5367.84s)]
*  He was the last WASP mayor of New York. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5370.96s)]
*  But he was like, he was like that. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5372.240000000001s)]
*  He was the WASP, right? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5375.160000000001s)]
*  He was the guy who limousine liberal, the term was invented for. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5376.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5379.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5380.240000000001s)]
*  And if you look at the way he conceived of himself and the way that he, uh, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5380.56s)]
*  in his class, the people who supported him, the Eastern establishment types and [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5386.24s)]
*  people like him, um, where they sort of drew their own sense of self-worth and [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5390.04s)]
*  their collective identity was first, we're better than those white people in the [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5395.6s)]
*  South who are protesting Martin Luther King and so forth were better than them. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5400.8s)]
*  Or the parents in South Boston who don't want busing for their own children. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5404.96s)]
*  Then, right. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5408.08s)]
*  So as they, after the civil rights movement kind of came to a conclusion, [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5408.68s)]
*  uh, in 1965 and the great migration was starting to create a lot of conflict in [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5412.88s)]
*  the Northern cities, like New York, uh, that idea, the Southerners are always, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5418.64s)]
*  they're, they're, they're always there as a foil for, uh, Northern and Western [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5424.8s)]
*  elite, you know, identity construction. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5428.56s)]
*  But it shifted to these ethnic groups that lived, that lived in the cities, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5430.72s)]
*  the Jews, which sounds strange today that like a, you know, a WASP mayor who's [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5434.56s)]
*  publicly obsessed with social justice would be against the Jews in a, you know, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5441.08s)]
*  in a, in a conflict, but he was at the time. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5445.16s)]
*  And it was because, you know, all these people, the Irish and the Italians, these [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5447.52s)]
*  people who think that like, that's their neighborhood because it's been their [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5451.4400000000005s)]
*  neighborhood for a hundred years now. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5454.56s)]
*  And, you know, it's a, everybody in the neighborhood goes to a parish church [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5456.400000000001s)]
*  that, um, they've gone to, their grandparents went to, um, they have [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5461.8s)]
*  internal social structures and, uh, dispute arbitration structures and all [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5466.92s)]
*  of these sort of organic institutions that, that grew up from ground level, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5472.12s)]
*  that gave them an ability to self-govern in a way that made it so they really [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5476.719999999999s)]
*  like, were not as dependent on, uh, the state bureaucracy to do these things for [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5482.0s)]
*  them, right? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5486.599999999999s)]
*  They could do a lot for themselves. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5486.88s)]
*  And, um, and these are the people who, uh, were resisting, you know, the movement [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5489.12s)]
*  of African-Americans into their communities. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5495.28s)]
*  When people look back, for example, like when, when Martin Luther King went up to [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5497.4s)]
*  Chicago in 1966 and there was the Marquette Park riot to this day, like you can go, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5500.5199999999995s)]
*  you have to go into a pretty deep, serious history book about that period to get the [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5506.44s)]
*  fact that, you know, everybody sees that as a bunch of white people who came out [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5510.88s)]
*  to protest, a bunch of black people moving or, you know, trying to open up [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5515.36s)]
*  their neighborhood. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5518.679999999999s)]
*  Uh, but that wasn't a bunch of white people. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5519.599999999999s)]
*  Those were Lithuanian people. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5522.28s)]
*  That was a Lithuanian neighborhood that had been a Lithuanian [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5524.160000000001s)]
*  neighborhood for some time. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5527.080000000001s)]
*  These are a bunch of people who had come over here as refugees and had set up a [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5528.4400000000005s)]
*  little community for themselves that they didn't want changed. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5533.120000000001s)]
*  You know, when, uh, that's a Latino community with a bunch of art, white [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5536.68s)]
*  art students moving into it and gentrifying it in Brooklyn or, uh, Los Angeles, [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5541.320000000001s)]
*  you know, people don't have a problem saying that they have a right to, you [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5547.6s)]
*  know, to, to maintain this community that they've built for themselves. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5550.96s)]
*  And I actually kind of agree with that. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5554.12s)]
*  Like I, too, when I see gentrification happening, it's like, you know, um, I'm [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5555.44s)]
*  sympathetic at the very least. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5560.16s)]
*  I'm very sympathetic. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5561.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5562.56s)]
*  The crime thing makes me look, I'm against, I'm against crime. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5563.2s)]
*  I'm against hurting people, you know, strangers, but the idea that people of [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5566.04s)]
*  all backgrounds, races, everybody, every human being has a right to like have a [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5570.4800000000005s)]
*  cohesive social network around him and live the way he basically wants to [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5574.96s)]
*  without bothering others and shouldn't be subject to, you know, abstract social [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5579.76s)]
*  planning that takes no account of human beings. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5585.08s)]
*  Like, yes. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5586.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5588.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5588.52s)]
*  I'm on this. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5589.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5589.64s)]
*  You know, there's this very interesting, uh, well, actually, you know what? [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5590.08s)]
*  That'll take me off on a whole other tangent. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5593.08s)]
*  I want to stick on the topic you were talking about. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5594.64s)]
*  I mean, you bring up like what's happening in England and Ireland. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5596.280000000001s)]
*  And I think, I think it's hard for a lot of Americans to really understand, uh, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5599.320000000001s)]
*  the tragedy of what's happening over there for the simple reason that. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5605.360000000001s)]
*  And I'm not, I'm not trying to trivialize our struggles with similar [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5610.400000000001s)]
*  issues here in the United States. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5614.04s)]
*  I just say that they're, that they're different, that, you know, in the United [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5615.4400000000005s)]
*  States, we've essentially had an unending demographic turmoil from the very [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5618.4400000000005s)]
*  beginning, you know, we fought our revolution and within a generation, uh, [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5623.68s)]
*  most of the major cities on the East coast were all majority Irish. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5629.360000000001s)]
*  And this was at a time when English and Irish wasp and Irish was like, you know, [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5632.64s)]
*  these were foreign, foreign peoples to each other, you know, Catholic and Protestant. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5638.080000000001s)]
*  That was still unresolved when I was small. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5641.88s)]
*  There you go. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5644.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, it went on a while. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5644.88s)]
*  And so within a generation, you know, of the revolution, most of the cities on [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5646.200000000001s)]
*  the East coast are majority Irish, or at least huge chunks of them are super [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5650.76s)]
*  majority Irish, even if the whole city is not quite, not to mention there's a [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5654.04s)]
*  lot of Germans, uh, although they assimilated to the wasp, uh, majority [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5657.0s)]
*  pretty well, pretty quickly, but then within a generation of that, just as the [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5661.04s)]
*  Irish are kind of starting to move out of the slums a little bit and become [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5665.08s)]
*  middle-class kind of members of the society, you start getting a ton of [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5669.0s)]
*  Italians, a ton of Jews, a ton of all the Southern and Eastern Europeans who start [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5672.12s)]
*  coming in and you see a repeat of the same process, a lot of the same problems, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5676.5199999999995s)]
*  the institutions all start to break down, the schools break down, the infrastructure [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5680.48s)]
*  breaks down and they blame the people coming in because they're the ones that [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5683.96s)]
*  are overwhelming. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5686.76s)]
*  Actually, you get a lot of violence and revolutionary movements. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5686.84s)]
*  You get a lot of violence, organized crime, revolutionary movements, all those things. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5688.2s)]
*  I mean, people forget that, you know, a lot of the lynching victims in the late [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5692.679999999999s)]
*  18, early 1900s were Italians. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5695.719999999999s)]
*  There's a famous one in New Orleans, but there are a lot of famous ones. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5698.24s)]
*  And, uh, and so that happens. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5701.719999999999s)]
*  And then we cut off foreign immigration in 1924. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5703.5199999999995s)]
*  Um, but then we start the great migration of African-Americans out of the South. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5706.799999999999s)]
*  You have the Oakey migration out West from the Dust Bowl. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5711.639999999999s)]
*  You have the, the, the big hillbilly migrations out of Appalachia up to [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5716.16s)]
*  Detroit and Chicago, those places. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5720.68s)]
*  And, um, so we're just used to the, like, the fact that we're always renegotiating [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5723.12s)]
*  our identity here, you know, we were this, this British, former British colonies that [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5728.76s)]
*  just fought for our independence. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5734.4800000000005s)]
*  But now we've got to figure out how to construct a collective identity that [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5735.84s)]
*  includes all these Irish people that came in. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5739.400000000001s)]
*  And like, one of the ways that we've done that traditionally has been through war. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5742.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, the fact that there were so many Irishmen who came into the country and [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5746.200000000001s)]
*  fought on the side of the union and the civil war. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5749.52s)]
*  If you look at like, uh, I mean, world war two to a great, I mean, if you think [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5752.240000000001s)]
*  about the city of Vicksburg, which didn't, didn't celebrate the 4th of July after [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5757.320000000001s)]
*  it was conquered during the civil war, like stopped celebrating the 4th of July. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5762.92s)]
*  And I remember I was watching, uh, the, the Kenwood, Ken Burns documentary about [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5767.52s)]
*  this war, he mentioned this and he said, and they didn't, they didn't celebrate [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5772.120000000001s)]
*  the 4th of July again for like X number of years and it's not off the top of my [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5775.360000000001s)]
*  head because I don't remember exactly what year they were. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5779.2s)]
*  Uh, it was a 63 Vicksburg anyway. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5781.36s)]
*  Um, he said first X number of years. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5785.04s)]
*  And, uh, I thought about it for a second. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5787.8s)]
*  I was like, Oh, that was July 4th, 1944. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5789.679999999999s)]
*  I was a month after D-Day. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5792.679999999999s)]
*  And that's what got this place. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5794.32s)]
*  It was extremely bitter over all this, uh, you know, to raise the flag and [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5795.84s)]
*  celebrate the 4th of July again. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5800.96s)]
*  And so we've used warfare. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5802.28s)]
*  80 years. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5803.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5804.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5805.5199999999995s)]
*  And we've used warfare for that purpose and that's not an uncommon thing, but [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5806.28s)]
*  it's, it's, it's one of the, one of the means that we've done to unify our people. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5810.4800000000005s)]
*  And as, as, you know, wave after wave of, at the time, very foreign people, you [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5814.360000000001s)]
*  know, it's hard to explain to people today how foreign and Eastern European [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5820.84s)]
*  Jew was to a Wasp or an Irishman or a German American in New York in, in, you [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5824.84s)]
*  know, 1880, and it's just, these are these people might as well have been [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5830.8s)]
*  coming out of the Congo, you know, and in some ways even more foreign than that, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5834.24s)]
*  because all of us, like we're kind of, even if we've never met anybody from the [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5839.56s)]
*  Congo, just through mass media and everything, we've kind of got a more [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5843.92s)]
*  cosmopolitan view of the world. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5847.08s)]
*  So we're not, it's sort of familiar in a, in a strange way. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5848.68s)]
*  These are people who are coming from all over the world. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5852.76s)]
*  And we've all, I mean, if you think about like, uh, the 1798 naturalization act, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5855.04s)]
*  right, you see a lot of like, uh, white identitarian types who point to that [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5859.16s)]
*  because it says all people, all white people of good character can come into [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5862.48s)]
*  the United States and become citizens. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5868.36s)]
*  And they say, see 1798, like they're already thinking in terms of race and [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5869.879999999999s)]
*  America is a white country, excuse me. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5873.799999999999s)]
*  And so forth. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5875.679999999999s)]
*  And I say, you're not understanding the historical context of, of that, of that [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5876.5199999999995s)]
*  law, that's not to prevent you from bringing in like half of the African [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5880.959999999999s)]
*  subcontinent or, you know, the, the Arab population in the Middle East or whatever. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5885.5199999999995s)]
*  That was inconceivable to these guys in 1798 that anybody would ever do that, or [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5889.08s)]
*  that that could happen. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5893.32s)]
*  That was not the point of it. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5894.16s)]
*  And if you really look at the law and you place it in the context of its time, the [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5896.56s)]
*  context of Europe at the time, remember again, Catholics and Protestants, like [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5901.36s)]
*  the different people across Europe, they've got two world wars still ahead of them. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5905.64s)]
*  They've got a Napoleonic war still ahead of them. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5909.24s)]
*  They're going to be butchering each other for the next couple centuries. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5911.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5914.16s)]
*  And we said, think about how just a revolutionary level of inclusivity this [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5915.200000000001s)]
*  is to say all you Europeans, anybody, if you live in Europe and you're Protestant, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5921.76s)]
*  you're English, you're Irish, you're Catholic, you're Jewish, whatever, you [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5928.400000000001s)]
*  come over here and when you come over here, you will be accorded the full rights [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5932.52s)]
*  and privileges of a citizen, the same as the richest guy in this country. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5937.72s)]
*  That is a revolutionary. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5942.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, nobody had ever heard of anything like that. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5943.44s)]
*  It was unbelievably just open and inclusive. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5945.28s)]
*  And the reason that they said that they limited it to, to free white people was [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5948.36s)]
*  they didn't want, you know, some Southern state, including their, their slaves as [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5952.96s)]
*  citizens, but not really including them and kind of gaming the federal system, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5960.799999999999s)]
*  getting representation because they decide to say, Oh, all of our Native [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5964.36s)]
*  American population are their citizens now, but not really allowing them, you [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5967.4s)]
*  know, in and so that's what they were trying to prevent. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5971.96s)]
*  Like the idea of bringing in just, you know, an overwhelming number of people [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5974.72s)]
*  from what became the third world was obviously the farthest thing from their [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5978.16s)]
*  minds because they couldn't conceive that anybody would do something like that. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5981.12s)]
*  And so, but that's the point is that this, even from the very beginning, there [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5984.72s)]
*  was a recognition that we need to be a radically open country if for no other [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5987.12s)]
*  reason, the fact that we've got a gigantic continent that we've got to go [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5990.4s)]
*  settle and build up, right? [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5994.0s)]
*  Because if we don't do it, then these European powers are circling like vultures [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5996.0s)]
*  and they're going to do it. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=5999.44s)]
*  And so we have to get out there and build this place up. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6000.36s)]
*  And so, you know, that required a level of openness that has transformed the [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6003.16s)]
*  world in a lot of ways. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6006.92s)]
*  It's just interesting here to say that the point at the time of, of mass [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6008.28s)]
*  immigration was to build the place up. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6012.0s)]
*  Clearly the point of it now is to tear the place down. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6014.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6016.639999999999s)]
*  And isn't that interesting how, you know, it's like, I think the psychologist [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6016.96s)]
*  Carl Jung said something like inequality and excess becomes its opposite. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6021.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6025.799999999999s)]
*  And, and it definitely has, you know, that applies to inclusivity [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6026.16s)]
*  or openness. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6030.24s)]
*  I think I was saying that like, you know, in the United States, because of that [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6031.08s)]
*  experience of just constant demographic turmoil, as soon as the great migration [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6034.92s)]
*  petered out in like 60, like literally the early sixties, we passed the hard [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6040.88s)]
*  seller immigration act and opened up the flood gates to the third world. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6045.16s)]
*  And that's the world that we're in now. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6048.04s)]
*  Right? [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6049.76s)]
*  So it has just been an unending wave after wave after wave of your neighbors, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6050.0s)]
*  people you have to negotiate politically and a social collective identity with [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6054.8s)]
*  are changing all the time. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6059.599999999999s)]
*  And that's just sort of, it's built into the American understanding of themselves [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6060.8s)]
*  and how societies work and all of that. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6065.04s)]
*  Like I would say that there's only maybe the only time the United States, like [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6068.32s)]
*  really, at least maybe like, you could say right after the revolution, but like [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6072.68s)]
*  the period, like from 1941, you know, right around that era, that, that time up [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6077.44s)]
*  to maybe the mid fifties, when the great migration started to drive all of the [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6083.32s)]
*  European ethnics out of the cities into the suburbs and stuff, like there was [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6089.12s)]
*  that period where we almost pulled it off. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6092.08s)]
*  We almost pulled off constructing a solid and sustainable national identity [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6094.5599999999995s)]
*  that, you know, obviously the fly in the ointment ended up being that there [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6101.44s)]
*  was 10% of the population that weren't really included in that, the African [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6104.719999999999s)]
*  American population. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6108.08s)]
*  And that became the sort of, you know, the wedge that allowed people to pry apart [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6109.6s)]
*  that project in the 1960s. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6115.64s)]
*  And, and thank you for acknowledging that was the point of the exercise. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6117.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6120.68s)]
*  And, and which, you know, again, not to diminish, you know, especially after [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6121.16s)]
*  going through, you know, the, the Jonestown series and spending so much time [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6126.84s)]
*  reading about the history of African Americans in the country. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6131.56s)]
*  And I grew up around in African American neighborhoods, mostly around [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6134.08s)]
*  different places. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6138.28s)]
*  I'm more sympathetic than most people who are as far right on a lot of [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6139.52s)]
*  political issues as I am to the plight of people who live in the ghetto. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6144.92s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't agree more. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6148.0s)]
*  No, but that's kind of the point that I'm making. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6149.56s)]
*  If the point of the civil rights movement was to uplift black people, which I would [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6151.400000000001s)]
*  be completely for, then Selma, Alabama would be a great place. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6157.64s)]
*  And so would Jackson, Mississippi. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6161.400000000001s)]
*  And so with Little Rock, Arkansas and all the kind of holy sites of that period. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6162.8s)]
*  And in fact, they're all far worse than they were in 1960. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6167.64s)]
*  So like, what was the point of that? [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6170.28s)]
*  Clearly if the point of BLM was to help black people again, I [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6171.92s)]
*  could kind of be for that. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6175.400000000001s)]
*  But I mean, the point of it, so there's, there's two elements, there's two [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6176.96s)]
*  answers to that question really. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6180.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6181.72s)]
*  Uh, one is there are people out there who absolutely saw it as, um, a wedge [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6182.84s)]
*  issue to spark revolution in one sense or another, you know, disintegration [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6188.28s)]
*  of the country, you saw this in the 1960s, Tom Wolf's written about it, but a [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6192.68s)]
*  lot of people have written about how, you know, you remember back in 2008, how, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6195.4800000000005s)]
*  when, uh, Obama started to rise to prominence and a lot of the older [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6200.12s)]
*  Republicans were throwing out, he's a community organizer, he's a community. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6204.96s)]
*  None of the younger people that just didn't land with younger people at all. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6208.240000000001s)]
*  Cause they had no frame of reference for the sixties and seventies and stuff. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6211.280000000001s)]
*  They didn't know what that meant. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6213.92s)]
*  That you literally had these vast government programs who were just handing [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6215.4800000000005s)]
*  out money to revolutionary organizations. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6219.360000000001s)]
*  The people who were going out and planning and organizing riots at city hall. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6221.44s)]
*  Oh, a hundred percent. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6225.799999999999s)]
*  Like that happened in New York, like a group who was not like, they got some [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6227.36s)]
*  funding through three different kind of, you know, degrees of separation from [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6231.919999999999s)]
*  some government program, they were literally just basically an agency of [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6236.919999999999s)]
*  the New York city government. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6241.719999999999s)]
*  They were literally just fully funded. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6242.839999999999s)]
*  Their leaders were appointed. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6244.919999999999s)]
*  Well, they're, they're paying for all the street gangs. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6245.759999999999s)]
*  And these, yeah, that too. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6247.32s)]
*  And this group went and held a protest at, at city hall, invaded city hall, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6248.76s)]
*  trashed the place and everything. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6254.96s)]
*  And this is a government funded organization. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6256.360000000001s)]
*  So that's what people had in mind. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6258.6s)]
*  And it didn't land with the younger people I noticed back then. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6259.84s)]
*  So you have those people, you know, you have the people who, at Columbia in the [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6263.52s)]
*  1960s, who wrote all the papers that led New York and then other places to, you [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6269.56s)]
*  know, to embrace busing at schools and to embrace expansion of the welfare, you [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6275.2s)]
*  know, programs and they were very open about, I mean, it's really crazy how [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6280.68s)]
*  these two professors at Columbia who were sort of the, like the expansion of [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6285.5199999999995s)]
*  welfare in New York under James Lindsay was kind of their brainchild. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6289.84s)]
*  They wrote the paper and the articles about it and everything. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6292.68s)]
*  And they were brought in as consultants. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6294.68s)]
*  Once the decision was made, they're literally writing in their papers. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6296.04s)]
*  If anybody at city hall had cared to read them, they weren't saying this is [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6299.44s)]
*  going to make poor people less poor. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6303.04s)]
*  In fact, they directly say what this is going to do is it's going to increase [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6305.5199999999995s)]
*  tension between the lower class, lower classes in the middle class. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6309.64s)]
*  It's going to drive a wedge because there's going to be like an unavoidable [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6313.76s)]
*  racial angle to this, because it's going to be transferring resources from the, [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6318.2s)]
*  you know, European ethnic groups in the city over to African-Americans and [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6322.64s)]
*  Puerto Ricans. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6325.8s)]
*  And this is all good because this is going to start to create that tension [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6326.44s)]
*  that we need. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6330.68s)]
*  It even, it even says- [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6331.839999999999s)]
*  They said that out loud? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6333.28s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6334.679999999999s)]
*  They were, they wrote about it in a, I can't remember which magazine it was at [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6336.0s)]
*  this point, but it was, it was like the Atlantic or something. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6340.5199999999995s)]
*  It was like that prominent magazine. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6342.88s)]
*  It was like a summary of their academic findings, right? [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6344.5199999999995s)]
*  And these are the guys who, they were the impetus for the expansion of the [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6347.5199999999995s)]
*  welfare programs in New York. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6351.639999999999s)]
*  They were brought into city hall to like explain how to implement it and stuff. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6353.36s)]
*  They even say that a positive benefit of this is it's going to make all of these [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6356.32s)]
*  people more dependent on the government. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6362.4s)]
*  You know, it's going to make them where they're- [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6365.32s)]
*  So, I mean, you have that angle of it, right? [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6367.48s)]
*  You have that side of things in those people who do, they know what they're [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6370.04s)]
*  doing and they want to tear this down. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6373.44s)]
*  I think that in a lot of ways, they're the drivers of a lot of it. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6375.28s)]
*  But a lot of people are the ones, you know, the ones being led, a lot of them, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6379.2s)]
*  it's just a lot of white people who use it to feel good about themselves. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6384.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, there's no, oh, and they don't have- [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6387.44s)]
*  I know them all, yeah. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6390.2s)]
*  They're able to insulate themselves from the consequences of their decisions in a [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6391.08s)]
*  way that, you know, and this is again, to take it international again, you go over [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6395.28s)]
*  to Europe, it's kind of what's gone on is, you know, if you're the leader of Hungary, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6398.32s)]
*  Victor Orbán right now, like you're the leader of Hungary. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6404.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're the leader of like Germany, if you're the leader of Great Britain, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6407.5199999999995s)]
*  yeah, like you're, we're still at the point where like you still, not in England, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6414.16s)]
*  we're not, but like where you still have to be German to like get elected. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6418.44s)]
*  You know, we can't like take it so far yet that we've detached it completely from [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6422.0s)]
*  like some illusion of the fact that this is a nation state that's self-governing. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6426.88s)]
*  But really this is an international superclass, you know, that they identify [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6432.24s)]
*  much more laterally with people of their own class across borders and they do with [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6436.16s)]
*  the people in their own countries. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6440.04s)]
*  And, you know, that mentality is what makes it possible for them to do the [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6442.12s)]
*  things that they're doing to the people that they have power over. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6447.32s)]
*  So what, at this point, you describe what's happening to Europe as the worst [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6452.04s)]
*  thing, not just the UK, but maybe especially the UK, but also Germany, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6456.759999999999s)]
*  Spain, Ireland, as you noticed, really everything west of Central Europe of [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6461.0s)]
*  Hungary is increasingly not European. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6466.56s)]
*  So what does that trend continue or stop or what happens? [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6470.72s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6474.68s)]
*  I mean, that's going to be up to the Europeans. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6476.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't, I say this with not without pride at all, but I think that, I think [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6478.6s)]
*  that as long as the United States remains the dominant power in the world and the [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6488.8s)]
*  dominant power in European geopolitics and a lot of places like Germany is still [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6492.68s)]
*  a significant factor in their domestic politics, I think that we are a very [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6498.4400000000005s)]
*  negative influence on that front. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6502.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6503.6s)]
*  I mean, it's so interesting to watch a ghoul like Ann Applebaum become [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6503.76s)]
*  literally hysterical, like shaking with rage in the way that people with no [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6508.4800000000005s)]
*  self-control do when Viktor Orban says stuff like, well, you know, I just don't [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6513.6s)]
*  want to admit like a million non-Hungarians into my country. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6518.88s)]
*  And they go, they go crazy. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6523.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6524.56s)]
*  I mean, you look at how they respond to somebody like Orban and like they would [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6525.360000000001s)]
*  color revolution that dude in a second. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6528.72s)]
*  If they thought they could get away with it, if they didn't think it was Orban. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6530.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, he's hardly like a right wing crazy. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6533.400000000001s)]
*  He's like very moderate and kind of like liberal in an 80s way. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6535.6s)]
*  That's probably the only reason they don't try it is they know that like his [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6539.08s)]
*  chief opposition is far to the right of him. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6542.0s)]
*  So that's probably why they don't do it. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6543.88s)]
*  But he's like the least extreme world leader I've ever met. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6545.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6549.200000000001s)]
*  It's funny. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6549.88s)]
*  It's like, it's, I get a similar sense for Mr. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6550.32s)]
*  Putin in Russia where, you know, he's a hard man. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6553.04s)]
*  You don't drag Russia out of its state in the 1990s without being a hard man. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6555.719999999999s)]
*  Um, but it's a, it's probably, uh, hoping for a little too much that whoever follows [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6560.24s)]
*  him up, you know, if we were to do something that would end his rule, that [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6566.719999999999s)]
*  whatever would come next would be beneficial to us. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6570.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6572.16s)]
*  So Trump, Orban and Putin, I can say, this is my perception of all three of them. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6572.24s)]
*  Is it none of them is particularly ideological. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6579.120000000001s)]
*  Um, all three are pretty sincere nationalists, not like crazed [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6583.08s)]
*  ideological nationalists, but just sort of want to do the best for their country. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6587.160000000001s)]
*  Um, none of them is like a religious nut and none of them is like, especially [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6591.240000000001s)]
*  right wing, they're all in, you know, in the 1984, five, six context, they would [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6595.92s)]
*  be sort of moderate, maybe conservative Democrats, liberal Republicans. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6602.4800000000005s)]
*  Like they're not, they're not at all what people claim they are. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6605.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6609.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, the, the, the post-World War II or order is really [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6609.56s)]
*  defined by the fact that, you know, after Nuremberg, uh, it really became [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6614.2s)]
*  effectively illegal in the West to be like genuinely right wing, like the [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6619.52s)]
*  things we call right wing. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6623.64s)]
*  I mean, it's all flavors of liberalism, basically. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6624.92s)]
*  And like, if you go back and read pre-war conservatives, pre-war right wing [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6628.16s)]
*  writers in Europe, like literally in a lot of places, it became illegal to be [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6632.6s)]
*  that way, right? [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6636.68s)]
*  And here again, it's not quite illegal, but we have control mechanisms, um, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6637.4800000000005s)]
*  that are almost as if the US government has had a lot of people to prison over [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6641.6s)]
*  the years for their political use a lot. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6644.080000000001s)]
*  That's true. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6645.76s)]
*  And, um, that's like a defining aspect of the post-war European order, right? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6646.84s)]
*  And as long as that order remains in place and remains a dominant factor, it's [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6651.320000000001s)]
*  going to be very hard for them to escape this cycle. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6655.200000000001s)]
*  And I want to be clear too, and I say like, that it's the [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6657.56s)]
*  worst thing that can happen. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6659.8s)]
*  I don't mean that, well, now you have to live next to these people who don't [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6661.64s)]
*  look like you or who, you know, speak differently. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6664.92s)]
*  Uh, that's something to do with that. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6667.84s)]
*  I get it. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6669.16s)]
*  You know, you're talking about a people. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6669.92s)]
*  And again, this is why I spent so much time on, on why it's harder for Americans [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6673.2s)]
*  to kind of really understand this. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6677.36s)]
*  It's because of our historical experience with just demographic turnover. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6679.2s)]
*  We kind of have this idea, even though we're being pushed to our limits right [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6682.8s)]
*  now, you know, and you're really starting to see that because of the, uh, the, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6686.0s)]
*  the, the ideological forces, um, and the cultural forces that are making it much, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6690.76s)]
*  much harder to swallow and digest the current, uh, the current crop of, uh, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6696.28s)]
*  new immigrants since 1965, much harder to assimilate for various reasons. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6701.0s)]
*  So we're approaching our limit here, but still, we still have this kind of idea [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6705.6s)]
*  in America that, you know, yeah, these things are going to happen and then we'll [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6709.4s)]
*  figure it out and renegotiate and kind of America will, yeah, we'll be different, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6714.0s)]
*  but, you know, in another generation or two, more change will be happening. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6718.76s)]
*  And that's just, you know, the dynamic of the United States. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6723.4s)]
*  And so we always have this sort of feeling that terms of our collective [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6725.92s)]
*  identity, like we'll figure it out. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6729.4s)]
*  You go to a place like, I mean, any European nation where this is, this is [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6731.4400000000005s)]
*  a people's ancient homeland and there's actually such thing as, you know, an [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6736.36s)]
*  Englishman, there's such thing as that. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6741.68s)]
*  Like there's an American is something that, again, the definition of it [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6744.0s)]
*  changes with every generation. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6747.4400000000005s)]
*  And it's always been that way. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6749.4400000000005s)]
*  The definition of an Englishman has never changed and it never will change. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6750.72s)]
*  And those people, the English people, not for over a thousand years, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6754.68s)]
*  not since 1066. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6758.200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6760.4800000000005s)]
*  And so in those people, uh, are going, they're in the process right now. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6761.12s)]
*  A forever losing the only spot of land that they have on this earth that is [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6766.56s)]
*  dedicated to the flowering and the preservation of the English people. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6771.52s)]
*  Like the only, and it's a tiny little spot. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6776.280000000001s)]
*  They're not for the Dutch. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6778.8s)]
*  It's true for the Spanish. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6779.92s)]
*  It's true for the Germans. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6781.0s)]
*  It's true for the Belgians. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6782.64s)]
*  It's true for every Western European nation. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6783.76s)]
*  So why not have a Nuremberg trial for the people who did that? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6786.8s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6790.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's such a crime. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6791.160000000001s)]
*  Well, we have to win first. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6792.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6794.360000000001s)]
*  No, but I just think it's important to say out loud that that's a crime. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6794.8s)]
*  It's against hundreds of millions of people. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6797.8s)]
*  If you go back to again, to bring up like Louis the 14th or any powerful monarch, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6800.599999999999s)]
*  they never would have dared imagine that they could do that to their people [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6804.879999999999s)]
*  without getting their head cut off. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6809.5199999999995s)]
*  They wouldn't have dared imagine that they could just replace their people with, [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6811.48s)]
*  you know, people from a different continent, different religion, different [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6815.879999999999s)]
*  land, just to overwhelm them, to make their own people a minority in that [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6818.5199999999995s)]
*  country for whatever reason, ideological, you can not, whatever it was, they just, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6822.959999999999s)]
*  it would, they wouldn't imagine that they had the right, the power, the ability to [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6827.76s)]
*  do that, you know, and I, I said something to you yesterday when we were having [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6833.16s)]
*  dinner that I would probably feel somewhat differently about this. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6836.639999999999s)]
*  If it was a situation where, you know, over the last eight generations of English [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6840.16s)]
*  people, of British people, that they had just sort of like gradually brought people [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6845.44s)]
*  in from around the world and over the course of 200 years or 300 years, they had [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6850.32s)]
*  just transformed the demography of their island into something unrecognizable. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6854.52s)]
*  Cause you could look at that and say, well, you know, I don't necessarily think [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6858.92s)]
*  that's the best idea for them or, you know, I don't like the changes that are [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6862.6s)]
*  being made, but Hey, the English people, they made this decision over the course [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6865.96s)]
*  of 200, 300 years. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6869.84s)]
*  Exactly. It's like their food. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6870.52s)]
*  I won't eat their food. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6871.360000000001s)]
*  It's disgusting, but they like it and that's okay. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6872.84s)]
*  But this one generation decided that they had no responsibility to any of the [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6875.040000000001s)]
*  people who came before them and they have no responsibility to any of the [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6882.04s)]
*  people who are coming after them. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6885.5199999999995s)]
*  They are going to permanently, radically, irreparably transform their society in [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6886.76s)]
*  ways that they know hurt the majority of the population. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6893.4s)]
*  They've immunized themselves from, you know, at present, but that they know are [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6897.0s)]
*  not welcome and are harmful to the majority of the people that they rule over. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6901.48s)]
*  And one generation of people decided that they had the right to do that. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6905.64s)]
*  And it's the post-war generation. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6909.84s)]
*  It's the generation born in 1946 between 1946 and 1964. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6912.04s)]
*  That's who did that. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6916.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6917.6s)]
*  So it's hard to escape the obvious conclusion. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6917.84s)]
*  And I suspect this is part of what's driving your current project. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6920.28s)]
*  That war didn't just redraw borders, but it, it changed the world in ways that are [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6923.72s)]
*  still unfolding and that who's like profound nature we're only now beginning [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6930.08s)]
*  to appreciate. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6933.76s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6934.32s)]
*  Sure. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6935.04s)]
*  I I'm a big fan of the writer, Rene Girard, right? [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6935.6s)]
*  He talks about, he's got this whole big theory about the origin of human [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6939.56s)]
*  religion and sacrificial ritual and stuff, but putting aside like his, his [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6943.240000000001s)]
*  broader speculations about the origin of religion, one of the things he talks [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6948.72s)]
*  about is if you look through the myths of every society, you can pretty much [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6952.360000000001s)]
*  think of throughout history. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6957.68s)]
*  If you look at like the national origin stories of any nation or people that you [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6959.64s)]
*  can think of, it is almost without exception. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6964.64s)]
*  And it may be without exception. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6967.8s)]
*  That there's blood at the beginning of that story. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6969.68s)]
*  There's in it's framed because it's a sacred story. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6972.68s)]
*  It's framed as sacrificial blood. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6976.120000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6978.200000000001s)]
*  And now sometimes like he'll give examples of that is true. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6978.4400000000005s)]
*  He'll give examples of sometimes, you know, there's a, like his, his basic [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6982.4800000000005s)]
*  theory, right. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6985.96s)]
*  Is that when a society finds itself in a time of tremendous turmoil and it may [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6986.4400000000005s)]
*  be just disunion, you know, or like people can feel like we've like we have right [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6991.160000000001s)]
*  now since like 2015 or however long it's been, there's just this tension. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=6997.32s)]
*  Where people kind of moderate people, regular people that you, that aren't [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7003.44s)]
*  typically political right. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7007.84s)]
*  And left for that matter, everybody kind of has this feeling that this can't just [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7009.04s)]
*  keep going the way it's going. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7013.799999999999s)]
*  Like, you know, we're approaching some sort of a point where decisions are going [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7015.88s)]
*  to have to be made, confrontations are going to have to occur and a decision. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7020.12s)]
*  Is going to have to be made because there's just too much ambivalent energy [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7023.719999999999s)]
*  pulling us in every direction. [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7026.52s)]
*  People feel it in their daily lives and they're, you know, uh, and so that starts [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7027.76s)]
*  to happen to a society and, um, he points to, uh, all these examples throughout [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7032.4800000000005s)]
*  history and ancient mythology, right. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7040.040000000001s)]
*  Where I'll talk about how there's some problem that was, you know, plague is, uh, [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7041.68s)]
*  is plaguing Thebes and, um, you know, whatever example you want to give. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7047.56s)]
*  And they find the scapegoat person for this and, you know, Jonah being thrown [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7053.08s)]
*  overboard into the sea, you know, to calm the storm and what do you know? [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7057.5599999999995s)]
*  We found the culprit. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7061.879999999999s)]
*  We found the perpetrator, the one who had like brought this curse upon the city [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7063.0s)]
*  because of his own private sin or whatever it was, and we got rid of that person. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7066.28s)]
*  And now everything is actually better. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7070.36s)]
*  And now the plague went away and the storm stopped and something. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7072.759999999999s)]
*  And so what Gerard says is, is this is a very interesting insight, I think, is he [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7076.44s)]
*  says what these all are, these are post-hoc, opulogies for what these people did. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7082.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7087.599999999999s)]
*  You know, they're looking back and saying that, uh, you know, this person who we [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7087.84s)]
*  murdered, um, that a, we had to do that, but then there's another little weird [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7092.719999999999s)]
*  dynamic where that person sort of becomes deified because at the end of the day, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7098.679999999999s)]
*  they did have the power to restore order and peace to the society to make the [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7102.08s)]
*  plague go away. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7106.599999999999s)]
*  And there's also a sort of ambivalent feeling because somewhere in there, they [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7107.759999999999s)]
*  do know that they murdered, you know, murdered this person as a scapegoat. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7110.76s)]
*  And, uh, so he gives an example, by the way of like, obviously he talks about the [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7115.0s)]
*  Christian story, the crucifixion. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7120.12s)]
*  And he says, you have a time like where this is like a, you know, Jerusalem was [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7121.56s)]
*  full of revolutionary ferment. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7126.0s)]
*  There were, you know, there were, there were rebel leaders and riots. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7127.56s)]
*  There were messiahs cropping up saying that they were going to lead a resistance [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7131.72s)]
*  against the Romans is a very, very, very tense time. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7135.64s)]
*  And the community, the Jewish community in Jerusalem was able to sort of go [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7139.240000000001s)]
*  through this process of uniting around the need to eliminate this victim who at [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7144.84s)]
*  least at present is like responsible and emblematic of all of the, uh, the insane, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7149.8s)]
*  the mounting insanity that's sort of engulfing us all right now. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7155.56s)]
*  And the difference though, and why Christianity is what it is, like you [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7159.040000000001s)]
*  think about the idea that we have the cross as our symbol, which is so strange [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7162.4400000000005s)]
*  to people who are not Christians. [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7167.68s)]
*  You know, it's like, for people today, you would have to think about like for [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7169.240000000001s)]
*  the, for the, for the visceral sort of way that somebody in the Roman world would [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7173.84s)]
*  have witnessed that would have seen that it would be like your religious symbol [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7178.240000000001s)]
*  was like a corpse hanging from a noose. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7181.360000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7183.200000000001s)]
*  You know, or a meat hook or, yeah, right. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7183.72s)]
*  And so like, that's what they would have seen. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7185.96s)]
*  That's kind of crazy when you think about it, like, wow, what is going on there? [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7187.8s)]
*  Like your, your God came down and he was murdered and tortured, put up on a cross [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7190.84s)]
*  and that's like your sacred symbol of him. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7198.92s)]
*  You're not trying to forget that part of the story or sort of pretend that [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7200.4400000000005s)]
*  didn't have, that is the story. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7203.2s)]
*  Very strange, right? [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7205.04s)]
*  And it's because this process that every myth, Gerard says was based on throughout [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7206.24s)]
*  history that you see, apologize for and rationalized in every one of these myths. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7211.28s)]
*  There were people who were following Jesus who refused to go along and they [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7217.4800000000005s)]
*  said, no, no, no, no, no, no, he was innocent and you murdered him. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7220.6s)]
*  And they refused to back down from that. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7224.68s)]
*  And you look like in the book of Acts, when Stephen gets murdered, they [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7226.56s)]
*  freak out and stone him. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7230.280000000001s)]
*  Not when he's making doctrinal points. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7231.84s)]
*  It's when he gets the place as you murdered him. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7234.200000000001s)]
*  He accuses them of murder and they stone him for it. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7237.08s)]
*  And you had these people who were willing to die for that. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7239.320000000001s)]
*  You know, they, they, they were willing to stand with the victim of, you know, [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7242.56s)]
*  of this mob attack of this scapegoat attack and die with him if necessary. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7247.48s)]
*  Because, you know, to a Christian, like that's what martyrdom means. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7251.5199999999995s)]
*  It's different than like what a Muslim means by it usually, right? [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7254.04s)]
*  You can go to war and die in war and you're a martyr, like in the Muslim world, [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7258.04s)]
*  which is fine. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7262.48s)]
*  Like they have their way of looking at things, but to a Christian doesn't mean [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7263.12s)]
*  you're dying for an idea, dying for Christ. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7266.44s)]
*  It means you're willing to die with Christ. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7270.5199999999995s)]
*  If you see a mob picking up stones and surrounding an innocent victim, you're [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7272.759999999999s)]
*  not going to slink away. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7276.44s)]
*  You're not going to pick up stone. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7278.28s)]
*  And, and if you do, then, you know, then you're, you know, you're making an [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7279.96s)]
*  irreparable sort of irrevocable choice at that point. [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7284.679999999999s)]
*  You are going to stand with that person against the mob, even if it means that [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7287.679999999999s)]
*  you die with him, that's what it means. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7291.879999999999s)]
*  And if everybody does that, then you have a transformed society and the [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7293.839999999999s)]
*  kingdom of God is here. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7296.44s)]
*  And so as a counter example, um, Gerard uses, uh, a holy man, first century, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7298.32s)]
*  first century, early second century called the Apollonius of Tyana. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7304.4s)]
*  And he was a pagan holy man who they constructed a biography for him that is [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7308.12s)]
*  essentially the same as Jesus, virgin birth, born in a manger, uh, 12 disciples, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7312.36s)]
*  um, eventually died and like was brought back to life. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7320.5599999999995s)]
*  And like, so it's like, it's, it's, it's a, it's a clear, like ideological [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7323.879999999999s)]
*  refutation of this growing Christian myth that's starting to take over the pagan [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7327.36s)]
*  world. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7330.64s)]
*  And one of his most famous miracles that he performed was there was a plague that [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7331.68s)]
*  was engulfing the city of Ephesus and they, nobody knows what to do. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7336.240000000001s)]
*  And so they call up Apollonius of Tyana. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7340.52s)]
*  You got to help us with this plague. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7342.52s)]
*  And so he goes up there and he says, okay, I'll help you, but you have to agree [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7343.68s)]
*  ahead of time, you do exactly what I tell you to do. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7347.240000000001s)]
*  You say, okay, great. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7349.64s)]
*  Just help us. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7350.68s)]
*  And so he leads the community to this town square and there's this old beggar [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7351.96s)]
*  who is, uh, you know, raggedy clothes, filthy, no teeth. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7357.679999999999s)]
*  He's just a, you know, destitute broken, like old beggar. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7362.599999999999s)]
*  And he tells the people around, he says, now pick up stones, kill that man. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7367.5599999999995s)]
*  And at first they're like, I don't know about this little word. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7372.719999999999s)]
*  And he's like, you want to plague to continue or not kill that man. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7376.12s)]
*  And so one stone flies and soon as one flies to fly, then their whole thing. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7379.719999999999s)]
*  And so they cover and they stone him to death and he's covered with like a [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7384.0s)]
*  Karen of stones essentially. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7387.32s)]
*  And as they're stoning him, his eyes flash red and he bears his teeth and [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7389.28s)]
*  they realize it's a demon. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7393.84s)]
*  And so they finish him off and at the end they clear away the stones and what they [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7395.04s)]
*  find is this giant frothing at the mouth, like dog demon thing. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7398.96s)]
*  And then the plague goes away. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7402.679999999999s)]
*  And what Gerard says, or he doesn't put it this way, cause this is a little [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7404.88s)]
*  too provocative for him, but I'll put it this way. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7408.28s)]
*  What you're reading there is the story of the crucifixion as it would have been [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7410.759999999999s)]
*  written from the perspective of the Pharisees. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7416.12s)]
*  That's what that is. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7419.04s)]
*  You know, of course he was, cause like, here's the crazy thing is it's not, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7420.5599999999995s)]
*  they're not imagining that after they kill that guy, that everything's getting [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7425.12s)]
*  better, it does get better because all of these people who were ready to just [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7429.36s)]
*  tear each other apart yesterday, once they all came together around that guy, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7433.76s)]
*  that's the guy who's responsible for all this. [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7440.72s)]
*  And we all came together to commit this crime against him. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7442.92s)]
*  We're all in this together in a way that we weren't before. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7446.76s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7448.84s)]
*  There's catharsis and then unity. [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7449.04s)]
*  Yes. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7450.56s)]
*  And so it actually does work in a very perverse way. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7451.16s)]
*  And that is the, of course it doesn't last and eventually you have to [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7454.16s)]
*  go through that cycle again. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7457.04s)]
*  That's why human sacrifice continues. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7457.96s)]
*  That's what Gerard says. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7459.84s)]
*  Have an abortion, be happy. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7461.56s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7463.04s)]
*  And that Christianity is the answer to all that. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7463.28s)]
*  And it's why that, you know, you can look and show similarities between, you know, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7465.76s)]
*  ISIS, Horus, Osiris and all these various things. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7469.84s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7472.92s)]
*  Like there's structural similarities in other myths to certain aspects of the [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7473.4400000000005s)]
*  story, whatever, but at a fundamental level, they are, they are not just [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7477.08s)]
*  different, they are radically opposed. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7482.360000000001s)]
*  They are 180 degrees. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7484.2s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7485.76s)]
*  And it's also possible that it's not just a function of human psychology, but [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7486.400000000001s)]
*  that there's also an element from the outside acting upon people. [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7490.24s)]
*  There is, maybe you are appeasing the gods or the demons actually for a short time. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7494.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7498.68s)]
*  I mean, that's it. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7499.44s)]
*  You know, most people come to me for history stuff, so I don't usually dive [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7500.04s)]
*  into that, but occasionally I do and my more tolerant subscribers, they, you [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7504.36s)]
*  know, they say they enjoy it. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7509.52s)]
*  So, yeah, that's. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7510.84s)]
*  So when can, just to tie a bow in the World War II project, for the reason I [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7512.68s)]
*  keep focusing on this is because probably the same reason you're doing it. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7522.68s)]
*  I think it's like, it's central to the society we live in, the myths upon which [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7525.08s)]
*  it's built, I think it's also the cause of like the destruction of Western [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7529.92s)]
*  civilization and these lies. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7536.12s)]
*  And so I just very much look forward to, to your honesty on this question. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7539.0s)]
*  When does this come out? [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7544.0s)]
*  I think I'll probably be ready to put out the first episode and maybe six months or [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7545.8s)]
*  so, because the, I've got another big, long episode I'm doing on the history of [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7550.68s)]
*  the labor movement wars, where it's, it's a great story about basically a big war [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7556.04s)]
*  that took place between the mafia and the American communist party over control of [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7562.160000000001s)]
*  the Hollywood unions. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7567.52s)]
*  It's a fascinating story, a lot of larger than life characters and stuff. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7569.0s)]
*  So I'll finish that up and then I'll start wrapping up my research and [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7571.6s)]
*  start moving on to that. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7574.52s)]
*  Can I say real quick too, because I did the thing, you know, your, your [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7576.280000000001s)]
*  interview with Mr. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7579.5599999999995s)]
*  Putin, I think probably prepared you for interviewing me because we both do the [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7580.44s)]
*  same thing. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7583.919999999999s)]
*  Like you asked me something about world war two and pretty soon I'm talking about [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7584.96s)]
*  Apollonius of Tiana. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7588.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7589.5599999999995s)]
*  You're telling you about the ruse. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7589.799999999999s)]
*  And so I can't help myself. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7591.679999999999s)]
*  That's, you know, you either love it or hate it. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7594.16s)]
*  That's what I do in my podcast too. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7595.839999999999s)]
*  But, you know, I think that world war two is a founding myth in that [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7598.759999999999s)]
*  Girardian sense for us. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7602.879999999999s)]
*  If you think about like just the strategic bombing campaigns, the ethnic [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7604.799999999999s)]
*  cleansing of the Germans after the war, what the Soviets did to East Germany [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7608.48s)]
*  after the war, just everything that happened that we did to, to, to win that [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7612.44s)]
*  conflict. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7617.28s)]
*  I mean, these are things that- [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7618.639999999999s)]
*  Or even the things that were maybe especially things we did after we win. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7619.759999999999s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7623.24s)]
*  Right. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7623.719999999999s)]
*  And so we do those things. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7624.08s)]
*  Nuremberg, the farce of Nuremberg and the whole thing. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7625.639999999999s)]
*  And that's just it. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7627.919999999999s)]
*  I think that Nuremberg like is that sacrificial ritual. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7628.679999999999s)]
*  And I might mean that literally, but I'm not married to it. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7632.28s)]
*  If people don't want to take it literally, they don't have to, but, you know, but I [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7634.799999999999s)]
*  probably do. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7638.36s)]
*  And I think it was that sacrificial ritual that was the founding event of the [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7639.2s)]
*  current global order. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7643.44s)]
*  It brought us all back together. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7644.679999999999s)]
*  It told us who the bad guys were, why they are in a binary sense, different from [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7646.12s)]
*  and opposed to us, which makes us the good guys. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7652.599999999999s)]
*  And now we can all, again, you know, Vicksburg celebrated the 4th of July. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7655.0s)]
*  But I do think there's something else going on because look, I think a lot of [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7660.28s)]
*  what we hear about world war two is a lie. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7664.88s)]
*  I've agreed with everything on the basis of much less knowledge than you have, but [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7666.24s)]
*  all of your conclusions are consistent with mine. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7669.32s)]
*  But I'm totally happy to say the Nazis were bad. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7672.44s)]
*  I think they were. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7674.84s)]
*  I'm totally happy to say the United States was the most virtuous player among the three. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7675.96s)]
*  But you're not talking about a historical event. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7681.16s)]
*  You're talking about a myth. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7682.679999999999s)]
*  Go, go tell a Muslim that, yes, Mohammed is a great guy. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7684.2s)]
*  He did a lot of great things, but. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7687.84s)]
*  And then see the reaction. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7690.28s)]
*  Everything comes after, but. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7691.48s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7692.639999999999s)]
*  No, you're totally right. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7692.96s)]
*  I just can't get over the fact that the West wins and is completely destroyed in [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7693.96s)]
*  less than a century. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7702.08s)]
*  Well, the West was conquered. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7703.4800000000005s)]
*  The rest, the West was conquered by the United States and the Soviet Union. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7705.92s)]
*  Okay. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7709.04s)]
*  But I'm including the United States in the West. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7709.28s)]
*  Right. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7711.12s)]
*  Somehow the United States and Western Europe won. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7711.44s)]
*  That's the conventional understanding. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7714.64s)]
*  And both have now look like they lost a world war. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7716.68s)]
*  So like, what the hell was that? [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7721.32s)]
*  Like there's something very, very heavy. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7723.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's all the things that we have been talking about and probably some [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7726.5599999999995s)]
*  things that, you know, we only talk about privately, but we can see the results of it. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7730.96s)]
*  I mean, the real question is if they were trying to achieve that destruction that you're [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7738.36s)]
*  talking about, if they were trying, they couldn't have done it more directly or more [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7743.44s)]
*  effectively, you know? [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7748.4s)]
*  And so there are trends and forces. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7750.320000000001s)]
*  There are things that drive people, you know, like incentives that drive people that [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7752.64s)]
*  they're not aware of. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7757.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things going on. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7758.6s)]
*  But if they had been doing it intentionally, there are a lot of incentives that drive [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7760.4800000000005s)]
*  people that are not aware of, boy, that is so true and worth well in your business. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7764.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's really important to remember that. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7768.76s)]
*  But for all of us, it's important to remember we're not quite sure what drives us or [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7770.0s)]
*  other people. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7773.240000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it's a value of history in a lot of ways is we have the benefit of hindsight. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7773.76s)]
*  And one of the things that you find, I found this again on pretty much every single topic [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7778.16s)]
*  that I've covered, even the labor movement, like ones that I'm doing now where I'm like, [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7784.2s)]
*  especially back in the old days, you know, before it became big labor, like I'm a fierce [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7788.76s)]
*  partisan of the labor movement back in the late 18 early 19. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7792.28s)]
*  Big time. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7795.64s)]
*  I totally agree. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7796.08s)]
*  And so I expected going into it like this is just going to be like a big, you know, [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7797.24s)]
*  screw the bosses, like, you know, pro-union, pro-everything kind of. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7801.4s)]
*  And I am still pro-union, pro-everything on that side. [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7805.48s)]
*  But it's made me be able to see where the bosses were coming from and what they thought [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7810.36s)]
*  they were looking at. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7815.0s)]
*  And if you take that any historical topic, any historical topic, if you allow yourself [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7815.759999999999s)]
*  to be open about it, you know, I have gotten an email, I got an email back in 2017, 2018, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7822.28s)]
*  from an active duty Israeli soldier who was serving actively in the West Bank, who told [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7831.52s)]
*  me that he heard my Israel Palestine series and that it opened up his, you know, his [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7836.080000000001s)]
*  understanding of how things did look to the other side and how the history was understood [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7843.56s)]
*  from the other side and that it affected the way he interacted with people on a daily [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7847.96s)]
*  Palestinians on a daily basis at his checkpoints and things like that. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7852.400000000001s)]
*  And it's because if you all praise to that guy, you know, good for him, because that's [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7857.2s)]
*  a tough thing to do, you know, especially when you're enmeshed in it like he is. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7862.24s)]
*  But if you allow yourself to be open and look at almost anything honestly, what you find [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7866.08s)]
*  is you end up with at least a certain amount of sympathy or understanding for almost [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7872.16s)]
*  everybody involved. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7878.0s)]
*  And that's the only perspective from which you can see the truth. [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7879.04s)]
*  I mean, I used to say to reporters who work for me as I'd be assigning stories, would [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7884.639999999999s)]
*  say, you know, you don't get to write a story about your girlfriend or your mom because [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7888.32s)]
*  you're blinded by love, but you're also not allowed to write a story about someone who [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7891.679999999999s)]
*  you hate, like, because hate is irrational, you know, strong dislike, disagreement, disapproval, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7896.24s)]
*  all allowed, encouraged, in fact, but hate blinds you. [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7901.759999999999s)]
*  And if you don't see the person as a person, you're not going to write about him accurately. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7905.599999999999s)]
*  Like, people are fellow human beings, however evil they are, right? [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7910.0s)]
*  And you see this with like, in good novelists versus mediocre novelists, right? [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7914.96s)]
*  Like you think of somebody like a great writer, like good prose writer like Jonathan Franzen, [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7919.68s)]
*  right? [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7925.6s)]
*  He's got this one book. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7925.84s)]
*  What book was it? [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7926.72s)]
*  I can't remember the title of it, but it's this sort of like urban rural book where the [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7927.4400000000005s)]
*  New York City, you know, cosmopolitan guy goes back to visit his family for Christmas in [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7932.24s)]
*  the country and, for instance, a great writer, okay? [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7936.48s)]
*  He can develop characters. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7940.16s)]
*  If this, the character that's from New York, richly developed. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7941.759999999999s)]
*  He deeply understands that man and you can tell by the way he writes it, nothing but [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7945.599999999999s)]
*  caricatures and stereotypes for his family members. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7950.32s)]
*  And it's because he just can't step into their shoes and understand them. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7954.16s)]
*  And they're like screaming racist epithets, smoking meth or something. [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7957.759999999999s)]
*  It was just hokey and like, you know, kind of a, like just a hallmark card version of [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7961.36s)]
*  what you would expect those people to be like. [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7966.639999999999s)]
*  It just was not anybody who's been around people like that or who's been people like [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7968.16s)]
*  that would just, I mean, you literally laugh at it. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7972.48s)]
*  And this is a great writer, but if you can't put yourself into the shoes of the people [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7974.4s)]
*  you're writing about, it leads to the point where you can humanize them. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7978.48s)]
*  You don't have to say like, oh, I could see if I was stolen. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7982.08s)]
*  I would have done that too. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7984.5599999999995s)]
*  That's not what it's about. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7985.599999999999s)]
*  It's can you at least like, can you get yourself to a place where you can see, oh, [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7987.04s)]
*  a person in that position at that time was seeing the world and the factors that they [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7990.88s)]
*  were taking into account when they were making their decisions. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7995.76s)]
*  And now you have people out there who are Jeffrey Dahmer. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=7998.96s)]
*  I'm not talking about people like that. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8001.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, those people who are pathologically broken, psychotic, you know, you think of [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8002.72s)]
*  a world leader like Idi Amin and even Mao to a certain degree, who I consider like much [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8007.04s)]
*  less like Stalin than he is like somebody like Idi Amin. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8012.88s)]
*  In other words, just like a childlike psychotic, you know, like a true psychotic. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8016.16s)]
*  Who enjoyed killing. [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8020.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8022.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8022.5599999999995s)]
*  And I mean, so you have those people and I'm not saying you should figure out how to [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8023.28s)]
*  identify with those people. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8027.28s)]
*  Those people are operating on a different program than you are that you're not going [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8028.48s)]
*  to be able to step into and understand. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8032.08s)]
*  But most people are not. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8034.639999999999s)]
*  Even the people, even the monsters in the world, the people that are not, you know, [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8036.4s)]
*  they're people who zigged when you would have zagged and over the course of a whole [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8040.88s)]
*  lifetime of making, you know, different decisions ended up in a radically different place. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8045.36s)]
*  You know, there are brothers and sisters, siblings who one of them ends up a drug addict [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8050.32s)]
*  and a porn star and the other one is an engineer and a family man or something like they grew [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8056.32s)]
*  up in the same household. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8061.599999999999s)]
*  That happens, but they respond to the things that confront them in life in different ways. [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8063.2s)]
*  And those things start to add up and eventually gain a momentum of their own. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8068.48s)]
*  And pretty soon, unless you, you know, unless you, it's very easy to get caught up in that [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8072.16s)]
*  and let that rule you. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8078.16s)]
*  And that's what happens in most, you know, most historical events, because most historical [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8079.84s)]
*  events are about groups. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8084.96s)]
*  You know, they're prominent individuals, but ultimately they're about groups of people. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8087.12s)]
*  And so, you know, the averages tend to tend to win out over time. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8091.12s)]
*  So last thing, for people whose appetites have been whetted to experience what, you know, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8096.32s)]
*  the history that you produce, where can people find this series, your labor series, your [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8105.44s)]
*  Israel-Palestine series? [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8111.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, how can they hear this? [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8114.48s)]
*  Sure. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8116.08s)]
*  So my main podcast is the Martyr Made podcast. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8116.639999999999s)]
*  Are we spelling Martyr Made? [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8120.4s)]
*  M-A-R-T-Y-R-M-A-D-E. [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8122.24s)]
*  I think when Joe Rogan and Dave Smith were talking about, or no, it was when Josh Barnett [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8125.759999999999s)]
*  was on there, my buddy Josh, they were talking about it and Rogan had never heard of it at [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8130.799999999999s)]
*  the time. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8134.48s)]
*  And he called me his names, Marty Armade. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8134.879999999999s)]
*  But yeah, Martyr Made, Martyr like Allahu Akbar, Made like a Made in America. [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8140.16s)]
*  And those are my long form history podcasts. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8147.04s)]
*  And they're found where? [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8149.759999999999s)]
*  iTunes, Spotify, wherever you want to look for them. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8151.04s)]
*  They also, they appear on my sub stack as well. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8154.88s)]
*  The sub stack is where I do a ton of subscribers only content. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8157.280000000001s)]
*  Once you get done with the countless hours of long form history podcasts, there are [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8160.96s)]
*  50, 60, maybe 70 more podcast episodes behind the paywall on sub stack along with [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8166.240000000001s)]
*  thousands of pages of essay series and things like that, where I kind of get [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8175.280000000001s)]
*  deeper into subtopics and just tangential topics that I would like to talk about in [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8180.16s)]
*  my main podcasts, but just can't quite fit them in and keep the narrative on track. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8184.88s)]
*  Your main podcast has no advertising? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8188.32s)]
*  No. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8190.5599999999995s)]
*  So total revenue to you for years of work is right around zero in that range? [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8191.599999999999s)]
*  For the podcast itself, yeah. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8196.56s)]
*  The podcast itself. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8198.08s)]
*  Yeah, I just think that's amazing. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8199.119999999999s)]
*  Dinner last night, I'm like, hmm, you're saying what took me five years to do this. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8201.279999999999s)]
*  I said, you know, how do you, I'm sorry to be vulgar and like a capitalist about it, [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8205.279999999999s)]
*  but like how, you know, how do you pay your mortgage? [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8208.56s)]
*  What do you make on that podcast? [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8211.359999999999s)]
*  Like nothing. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8212.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8213.68s)]
*  Well, the podcast is an advertisement, right? [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8213.92s)]
*  People listen to them. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8216.4s)]
*  They like them. [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8217.519999999999s)]
*  And then they find out that I have a subscriber. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8218.24s)]
*  In TV, we do a tease. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8220.24s)]
*  It's about 30 seconds long. [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8221.439999999999s)]
*  There you go. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8222.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8223.039999999999s)]
*  Mine are seven hours. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8223.359999999999s)]
*  So you're a sub stack also Martyr Made. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8226.88s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8229.359999999999s)]
*  And that's subscribe.martyrmade.com. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8230.56s)]
*  And it has to be that because if you go martyrmade.substack.com, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8234.24s)]
*  Elon kills it on the X algorithm. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8237.6s)]
*  So subscribe.martyrmade.com. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8240.24s)]
*  I do another podcast with my friend, Jocko Willink, who's a retired Navy Seal commander. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8243.28s)]
*  A lot of people have heard of, we do one called the Unraveling. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8247.2s)]
*  And how often? [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8250.24s)]
*  Well, lately, not as often as we should. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8252.4s)]
*  We've been having trouble making our schedules meet up, but we've got 40 some episodes out at [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8254.0s)]
*  this point where we talk about more current historical topics. [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8257.92s)]
*  Sometimes we get into politics. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8262.4s)]
*  Our last one was on deinstitutionalization and the kind of the fallout and the homeless crisis [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8264.72s)]
*  that's partially resulted from that. [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8269.76s)]
*  So we get into all those things. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8271.44s)]
*  You get to hear like a hardened warrior like Jocko comment on mental health crisis, for example. [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8273.04s)]
*  So that's a lot of fun. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8280.48s)]
*  Joe Cooper, Martyr Made. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8283.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8284.960000000001s)]
*  Thank you for this conversation and for your addition to the sum total of knowledge. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8285.44s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8289.2s)]
*  It's always fun. [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8290.16s)]
*  Thanks. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8291.36s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8294.4s)]
*  I know. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8300.16s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake, Google would be putting its thumb on [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8301.12s)]
*  the scale and preventing you from hearing anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8306.64s)]

*  And we hope you will. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOTgPEGYS2o&t=8335.68s)]
