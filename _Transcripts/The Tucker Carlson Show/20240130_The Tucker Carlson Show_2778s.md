# Russell Brand Responds to Coordinated Smear Campaign Against Him
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ)
*  Back in September, media outlets around the world, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=0.0s)]
*  almost all of them here in the West [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2.64s)]
*  and the English speaking world, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=4.92s)]
*  ran headlines that shocked a lot of readers and viewers. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=6.36s)]
*  Russell Brand, the movie star, the comedian, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=9.4s)]
*  now the podcaster, was a sex criminal, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=12.46s)]
*  a bad man, a sex criminal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=15.52s)]
*  Now, none of the outlets ran the names of the accusers [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=18.22s)]
*  who had been sexually abused by Russell Brand. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=22.04s)]
*  That was conspicuously absent. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=23.92s)]
*  But the judgment was overwhelming. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=26.3s)]
*  This is a very bad man, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=27.92s)]
*  and he needs to be taken out of public view [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  for the sake of the rest of us. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=31.680000000000003s)]
*  What was interesting about this is that, in fact, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=34.32s)]
*  it was the final scene in a long movie [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=38.52s)]
*  that had been playing out for the preceding couple of years [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  outside of public view. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=44.92s)]
*  This was an attempt to make Russell Brand shut up. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=46.8s)]
*  Russell Brand has views that diverge [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  from those of most Western governments on big issues, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  not small things, big issues, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  questions of economic policy and war and peace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=55.68s)]
*  And they decided we have to make this man be quiet. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=59.2s)]
*  Why Russell Brand? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=61.24s)]
*  Well, because in contrast to a lot of us [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=62.92s)]
*  who give our opinions for a living, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Russell Brand had the capacity to win people over [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=67.0s)]
*  from the other side. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=69.34s)]
*  He hadn't spent a life identified with the far right, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=71.28s)]
*  just the opposite. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=74.2s)]
*  Russell Brand was a man of the left [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=75.34s)]
*  and, to most people, a cultural figure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=77.08s)]
*  Everyone knows who Russell Brand is. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=79.74000000000001s)]
*  And so he had the power, the capacity, to persuade, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=81.68s)]
*  and that was the threat. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=86.08s)]
*  So we thought it'd be interesting to go through, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  in some detail, what happened to Russell Brand. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=90.36s)]
*  None of this has ever been aired before. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=92.72s)]
*  The censorship campaign against him began with governments, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=94.84s)]
*  not private organizations, but governments, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=98.38s)]
*  their intel services and their policymakers. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=100.2s)]
*  And as we said, it played out outside public view, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=102.8s)]
*  and we thought it would be very interesting and important [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=106.22s)]
*  for people to know what exactly happened. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=108.8s)]
*  And so to find out, we are now joined by Russell Brand himself, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=112.08s)]
*  and we're grateful to be. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=113.84s)]
*  Russell Brand, thank you so much. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=114.68s)]
*  Tucker, thanks for having me here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=115.88s)]
*  So I didn't know any, I just want to say, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=117.32s)]
*  I didn't know any of this, and I experienced you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=119.56s)]
*  because I didn't know you as a viewer, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=122.12s)]
*  and I remember thinking, boy, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=124.0s)]
*  that is one of the most articulate critiques [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=125.0s)]
*  of the brand new war in Ukraine I had ever seen. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=128.4s)]
*  I saw one of your videos on the war in Ukraine, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=130.88s)]
*  and this was in the winter of 2022, two years ago, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=132.68s)]
*  and you were making kind of a remarkable case, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=138.0s)]
*  not against the Ukrainian people, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=139.92000000000002s)]
*  and certainly not in favor of Russia, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=141.16s)]
*  but that there might be real implications for the West [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  if we get involved in a war that is not our own, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=144.96s)]
*  and I thought said it so well. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=146.72s)]
*  What I missed and I'm now seeing is that in March of 2022, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=149.24s)]
*  you were denounced by an organization [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=155.12s)]
*  connected directly to the US government [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=158.12s)]
*  as an agent of Chinese propaganda for your views on Ukraine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=160.54000000000002s)]
*  So let me just ask you your experience of this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=166.24s)]
*  Did you know that you were being attacked [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=168.32s)]
*  as a Chinese propagandist for your views on Ukraine? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=170.24s)]
*  I actually didn't, and still at this point, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=172.68s)]
*  struggle to see entirely what the connections are [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=174.84s)]
*  between those two issues, and how I would develop [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=178.96s)]
*  and cultivate a strong affinity with China. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=182.36s)]
*  I've never been to China. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  I don't purport to understand China. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  Certainly don't advocate for Chinese policy. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  I've just got relatively superficial, dilettante knowledge [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=192.44s)]
*  of geopolitical matters in the South Asian seas. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=196.56s)]
*  It's not something that I would like to tie my colors [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=199.56s)]
*  to the mast for or be willing to be publicly ashamed, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=201.36s)]
*  attacked, and even jailed for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=205.04s)]
*  So it happened though, and a lot happens [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=207.96s)]
*  on the internet that we miss, but these, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=211.36s)]
*  in my reading of it, and we haven't, by the way, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=214.5s)]
*  talked about this affair, but my reading of it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=217.02s)]
*  is that these were the early seeds [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=219.6s)]
*  of a very deceptive plant that flowered [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=222.34s)]
*  more than a year later in September [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  when you were accused of these crimes, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=227.48s)]
*  and demonetized and censored as a result of that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=230.32s)]
*  But looking back, so you were accused [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=233.0s)]
*  by a group called Coda Story. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=237.04s)]
*  It published a story on its anti-disinformation newsletter. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=239.04s)]
*  Now, Coda Story is connected to the UK government, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=243.0s)]
*  but it's also connected to the CIA. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=246.04s)]
*  How does it make you feel to know that you were [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=250.72s)]
*  in the crosshairs of two of the most powerful governments [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=252.95999999999998s)]
*  in the world, and their intel agencies? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=256.64s)]
*  It seems to me ridiculously grandiose to even imagine [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  that I would stir and arouse the interests [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=263.46s)]
*  of such powerful agencies and groups [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=266.24s)]
*  that the British government, if indirectly, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  would spend considerable sums on observing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=272.12s)]
*  and de-amplifying content that true information [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=275.28s)]
*  shared through our platforms in the period [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=279.12s)]
*  of the pandemic was censored, was cited as high risk, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=281.64s)]
*  that companies like Moderna had spent [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=286.04s)]
*  considerable revenue tracking our content, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=288.32s)]
*  and again, de-amplifying it, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  that Dame Caroline Dynage, whose husband is a Psiops expert [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=292.56s)]
*  that worked abroad in terrorism [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=296.6s)]
*  before deploying those methods and techniques, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=298.26000000000005s)]
*  and to some degree, those teams, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  to observe what they call disinformation [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=303.0s)]
*  and misinformation in the UK. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=305.16s)]
*  I recognize that the new emergent media spaces [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=307.88s)]
*  present a lot of possibilities, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=310.66s)]
*  even with your kind compliments [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  about our reporting on the Ukraine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=314.16s)]
*  All we've essentially done is listened [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=316.8s)]
*  to brilliant academics talking about the history of NATO [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=317.64000000000004s)]
*  and the coup in 2014 in Ukraine, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  and Putin's explicit declaration that he would prefer, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=323.72s)]
*  let's put it mildly, that Ukraine [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=328.28000000000003s)]
*  were not invited into NATO, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  some of the regional disputes, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  how they're escalating tensions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  This is information that, because of independent media, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=335.8s)]
*  is available, and perhaps the function that we, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  our media organization, have fulfilled [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=340.68s)]
*  is being to collate that information [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  and convey it directly in an accessible manner [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=346.52s)]
*  to give people an alternative perspective [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=348.74s)]
*  to the homogenized mainstream opinion, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=351.5s)]
*  which amounts to, I've learned over the last few years, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=354.18s)]
*  the amplification and normalization [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=357.18s)]
*  of the agenda of the powerful, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=359.66s)]
*  that no opinions can be allowed into that space, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=361.34000000000003s)]
*  and I'm astonished by how jealously it is guarded. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=364.34000000000003s)]
*  There are points in my life where my personal self-regard [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=367.2s)]
*  would have loved the idea that I would be considered [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=370.34000000000003s)]
*  important enough to attack on this scale, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=372.74s)]
*  to spend this amount of revenue and resources on, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  but I'm now seeing that independent media itself [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=378.54s)]
*  is an extraordinary threat. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=381.22s)]
*  That independent media inevitably leads [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  to independent politics and independent thought, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=385.02000000000004s)]
*  and we appear to be at some precipitous moment [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=387.66s)]
*  of radical transition. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=390.5s)]
*  I'm not sure, and I'm not sure if anybody could be sure [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=392.5s)]
*  of where this is all heading, what the exact teleology is, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=395.46000000000004s)]
*  but it seems to be to do with mass centralization, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=398.26000000000005s)]
*  globalization, significant attempts [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=401.90000000000003s)]
*  to control the information space [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=404.5s)]
*  that are so rigorously adhered to and protected [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=406.58s)]
*  that even what you might imagine to be a marginal voice [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=409.56s)]
*  is considered a significant enough threat [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=412.54s)]
*  to warrant coordinated media attacks, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=415.1s)]
*  expenditure on peculiar clandestine [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=417.92s)]
*  non-government organizations and think tanks [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=421.08s)]
*  that take their money from the military industrial complex, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=423.38s)]
*  from the legacy media, who, by the way, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=425.74s)]
*  when they're critiquing independent media, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=427.68s)]
*  they got skin in the game. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=429.88s)]
*  They're not able to independently assess your work [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=431.22s)]
*  or my work or the medical opinions of Joe Rogan. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=435.21999999999997s)]
*  They have a vested interest in destroying [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=437.7s)]
*  those organizations. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=440.42s)]
*  In the last few years, I've learned about [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=441.62s)]
*  the Trusted News Initiative, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=443.38s)]
*  which has extraordinary connections, again, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=444.9s)]
*  to Big Pharma and sets of interest [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=447.42s)]
*  around the reporting on war that have decided [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=449.3s)]
*  and determined that they are no longer competing [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=451.74s)]
*  with one another. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=454.02s)]
*  You, in particular, come from a journalistic background [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=454.86s)]
*  where it would have been commonplace [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=457.06s)]
*  for the great institutions of American media [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=458.28s)]
*  to compete with one another for scoops, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=461.21999999999997s)]
*  the New York Times versus the... [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=463.09999999999997s)]
*  Those days are gone. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=465.14s)]
*  It explicitly states on the Trusted News Initiative website, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=466.18s)]
*  we are no longer in competition with one another. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=469.53999999999996s)]
*  We have to curtail and stamp out, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=471.78s)]
*  I think it even uses the word choke independent media. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=474.18s)]
*  And it's clear that there are now sets [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=477.53999999999996s)]
*  of globalist organizations funded by government, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=479.9s)]
*  but also corporations that are making deliberate, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=483.21999999999997s)]
*  profound attempts to shut down any dissent [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=486.21999999999997s)]
*  in an astonishingly aggressive way [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=488.91999999999996s)]
*  and to be sort of caught up in it [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=491.26s)]
*  is terrifying on one level, absolutely terrifying, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=493.62s)]
*  particularly due to the nature of allegations I've faced, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=497.65999999999997s)]
*  but also revealing, more importantly, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=501.62s)]
*  it's revealing about the way that I believe the world [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=504.18s)]
*  and in particular this space will be affected [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=507.3s)]
*  and the way these events will continue to unfold [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=509.65999999999997s)]
*  in the coming years. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=511.58s)]
*  What I love about your critique is that you're coming [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=512.42s)]
*  to all of this pretty cold [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=514.72s)]
*  since you had a midlife career change. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=515.9399999999999s)]
*  You're doing something very different [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=517.98s)]
*  from what you did 15 years ago. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=519.32s)]
*  And I'm wondering if your assumptions [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=521.6400000000001s)]
*  haven't been completely blown up. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=523.48s)]
*  You're a British citizen, lived in the country for life. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=524.72s)]
*  How strange is it to know that your tax dollars [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=529.36s)]
*  are being used against you by your government, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=531.7800000000001s)]
*  which they are, and how bewildering is it to find [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=534.08s)]
*  that the open contest of ideas that we were promised [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  here in the West, may the best idea win, is a sham? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's a, well, I suppose I went into [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=543.8800000000001s)]
*  the entertainment industry really with the giddy trajectory [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=548.36s)]
*  that propels a lot of people into those spaces, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=552.92s)]
*  believing that there might be some fulfillment [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  and certainly there would be excitement. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=557.88s)]
*  And when I was a denizen of that world, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  I was fostered and adored and celebrated and facilitated [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=562.12s)]
*  and lived the kind of lifestyle, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=567.52s)]
*  which I think is kind of common for people in that area, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=568.96s)]
*  for single people, in my case, drug and alcohol free, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=572.24s)]
*  but certainly with an appetite for a promiscuous lifestyle. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=576.4s)]
*  When I was part of it, I found it empty and unfulfilling, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=580.56s)]
*  of course, as it would be, as anyone who's had [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=584.52s)]
*  those kinds of experiences ultimately realizes. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=586.3199999999999s)]
*  When I departed it, as a result, really, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=589.56s)]
*  of various spiritual crises or commercial failures [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=591.88s)]
*  or a combination of those events, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=594.92s)]
*  I really felt like a coming home to the type of values [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=597.3199999999999s)]
*  that I grew up with. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=600.8s)]
*  I grew up in a normal blue collar town, Greys, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  kind of like a place that's like New Jersey, I guess, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=604.96s)]
*  a kind of suburban outside of the city, normal people, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=608.0s)]
*  good values kind of place. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=611.9200000000001s)]
*  And what I feel like happened is like, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=614.0s)]
*  since I've had a family, since I've got a young son, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  I've got a couple of daughters, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=619.64s)]
*  is I've felt like that I was able to deploy the skills [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  learned through working in entertainment [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=625.2800000000001s)]
*  as a man in recovery in a new space. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=628.0400000000001s)]
*  And what simply began with myself and my partners [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=631.0400000000001s)]
*  tell the truth about things you care about, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=633.88s)]
*  kind of over time, it began to, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=636.4s)]
*  I suppose Glenn Greenwald, he goes, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=639.6s)]
*  you shouldn't be surprised that if you attack [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=641.64s)]
*  the most powerful interests in the world, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=643.9200000000001s)]
*  the deep state, powerful corporations, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=645.6800000000001s)]
*  the machinery of war, that you yourself [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=647.88s)]
*  are the recipient of attacks. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=650.2s)]
*  Why is that surprising to you? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=652.24s)]
*  I know, but because sometimes it just feels speculative, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=654.84s)]
*  doesn't it? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=657.6s)]
*  You're talking about these really powerful organizations [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=658.44s)]
*  and the way that it's funded and the way that it crosses [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=660.4s)]
*  over and their malfeasance, underhanded insidious activity. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=662.52s)]
*  And then as it starts to become more popular, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=666.36s)]
*  as more and more people realize that it's actually true, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  as more and more people become willing to take back control [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=671.76s)]
*  in their own lives, as more and more people refuse [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=674.64s)]
*  to consent to being treated in this sort of infantile way, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=677.16s)]
*  having their autonomy and personal and mental [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=682.0s)]
*  and spiritual freedom undermined, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=684.1999999999999s)]
*  their connection to their land undermined, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=686.16s)]
*  their connection to nature, they're devoided. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=688.3199999999999s)]
*  You start to realize that you're actually operating [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=691.7199999999999s)]
*  in quite a powerful territory. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=693.8399999999999s)]
*  But while power is very serious and it has to work very hard [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=695.56s)]
*  to maintain its grip. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=699.52s)]
*  So these organizations, did it surprise me to find [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=701.0s)]
*  that the British government, through the Department of Culture [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=704.16s)]
*  and Media and Sport, the very person, the very people [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=708.56s)]
*  that sponsored the new, rather draconian online safety bill, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=712.04s)]
*  personally contacted the height of these allegations [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=716.04s)]
*  and attacks on me that contacted social media platforms [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=720.48s)]
*  and asked if I would be demonetized. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=724.2s)]
*  But they're the body that regulates them. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=726.1600000000001s)]
*  They have the ability to find those organizations. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=728.12s)]
*  They're the very person who is sponsoring [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=730.24s)]
*  the online safety bill. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=732.2800000000001s)]
*  May I ask you to pause for a second? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=733.12s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=733.96s)]
*  Just to be clear, I understand what you're saying. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  So these accusations appeared, there were, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=735.62s)]
*  I don't know if this has changed, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=739.2s)]
*  but at the time there were no names attached at all. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=740.08s)]
*  You were accused anonymously of committing crimes. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=741.6400000000001s)]
*  And then your own government, which you pay for, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=745.2s)]
*  reached out without telling you to online service providers [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=748.4s)]
*  and media organizations and said, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=753.16s)]
*  "'Please kick him off and censor him [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=754.76s)]
*  "'and take his money away.'" [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=756.32s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=757.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  Before any kind of trial, before any proof [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=759.52s)]
*  that you were guilty, before any names were attached. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=763.04s)]
*  Yeah. That happened. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=765.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's the same people [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=767.44s)]
*  that are sponsoring online safety bills, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=769.08s)]
*  which amount to facilitating further censorship. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=771.12s)]
*  But what a betrayal by your own government. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=773.96s)]
*  Well, it's astonishing if you regard your government [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=775.88s)]
*  to be in a position of service [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=778.56s)]
*  rather than a position of domination and control. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=779.96s)]
*  But what's become apparent in recent years [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=783.4s)]
*  is what the nature of our relationship with government is, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=785.48s)]
*  that they are there to rule and control and dominate. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=788.04s)]
*  And whilst they may now do it with an aesthetic of care [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=792.32s)]
*  and with the language of inclusivity, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=796.12s)]
*  I believe the threat of authoritarianism is far, far greater [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=798.96s)]
*  from those that use the language of liberalism [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=803.28s)]
*  than these emergent, somewhat nationalistically oriented [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=806.16s)]
*  populist movements present, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=810.4s)]
*  because they are leveraging that power now. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=812.52s)]
*  They're interested in censorship, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=815.64s)]
*  they're militarizing the police force, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=817.12s)]
*  they're introducing protest laws, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=818.72s)]
*  they're introducing censorship laws. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=820.16s)]
*  Through their actions, we can observe them. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=822.76s)]
*  Through their fruits, can we know them? [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=824.92s)]
*  We can see what they'd... [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=826.68s)]
*  And if you try to dissent, if you try to oppose, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=827.72s)]
*  even what I consider to be [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=830.3199999999999s)]
*  a relatively marginal scale, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=831.84s)]
*  then the consequences are severe and immediate [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=834.48s)]
*  and robust and terrifying. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=837.52s)]
*  I think what makes your specific case so compelling [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=840.4s)]
*  is that if they could do it to you, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=844.24s)]
*  a person who had the admiration of a lot of people [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=846.52s)]
*  who weren't interested in politics [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=848.2s)]
*  and was pretty famous and had some means, et cetera, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=849.36s)]
*  then the average person stands no chance [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=853.2s)]
*  against these forces. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=855.76s)]
*  So with that, if you don't mind, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=857.0s)]
*  can we get specific about a couple of things [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  that you mentioned? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=860.4000000000001s)]
*  The first is Moderna, which is a drug company. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=862.8s)]
*  It's part of Big Pharma. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=865.0s)]
*  Tell us how you intersected with Pharma [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=866.5999999999999s)]
*  and with Moderna and what you think they did to you. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=869.16s)]
*  During the pandemic period, we reported continually [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=872.56s)]
*  about some of the clinical trials that Moderna conducted [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=875.64s)]
*  and whether or not they ought be deemed [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=881.52s)]
*  sufficiently rigorous to warrant the level of measures [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=883.64s)]
*  that were being implemented, if not entirely mandated. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=887.7199999999999s)]
*  We talked about a government official called Jonathan Van Tam [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=890.32s)]
*  who was the public face of the government saying, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=893.9200000000001s)]
*  we should be taking vaccines, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=897.1600000000001s)]
*  recommending that the measures escalate. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=899.12s)]
*  Jonathan Van Tam subsequently took a position at Moderna. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  We reported on that. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=905.44s)]
*  People within the FDA took positions at Moderna. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=906.4000000000001s)]
*  We reported on that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=909.2s)]
*  We accurately reported that both Pfizer and Moderna [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=910.2800000000001s)]
*  were making $1,000, like a second or a minute, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  just like we reported a lot. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=916.84s)]
*  We reported accurately and thoroughly [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=919.08s)]
*  about the degree to which Big Pharma were profiting [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=922.32s)]
*  from a situation in which Albert Baller explicitly said [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=925.84s)]
*  it would be inhumane to profit from this global crisis. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=929.0s)]
*  This meant that we were tracked [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=934.0400000000001s)]
*  by agencies employed by Moderna. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=935.36s)]
*  They had like us on a high risk category. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=937.9200000000001s)]
*  This is the reporting of Lee Fang on his sub-stack, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=940.08s)]
*  not just me, Jay Bhattacharya, Michael Schellenberger, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=942.88s)]
*  Alex Berenson, a number of what you might call [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=946.16s)]
*  anti-pandemic measures voices or strong critics [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=949.4s)]
*  of the way that the pandemic unfolded [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=952.48s)]
*  were under observation by agencies [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=954.0799999999999s)]
*  that were either funded by Big Pharma, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=956.48s)]
*  sometimes the government. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=958.24s)]
*  And in a sense, what I've started to realize, Tucker, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=959.4399999999999s)]
*  is this cartilage between the state [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=961.92s)]
*  and the corporate world is often provided [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=964.52s)]
*  by these unusual organizations [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=966.76s)]
*  that are claiming to be observing disinformation [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=969.6s)]
*  or monitoring, but they're actually crushing the scent. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=973.0s)]
*  That's what they're doing in practice. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=975.84s)]
*  Descending voices are being aggressively crushed [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=977.24s)]
*  by almost any means necessary. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=979.96s)]
*  The media organizations are collaborated [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=982.2s)]
*  in a way that is unprecedented [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=984.9200000000001s)]
*  in order to shut down dissenting voices. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=987.08s)]
*  And it appears to me that this is part of something, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=989.32s)]
*  I don't know that we've seen anything like this before. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=993.1600000000001s)]
*  So what you're saying is that these organizations [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=995.48s)]
*  which purport to be independent [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=997.4s)]
*  are not actually independent from government. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=999.88s)]
*  They merely give government, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1001.72s)]
*  the politicians and the intelligence agencies, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  especially some plausible deniability, some distance. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1009.36s)]
*  What they're doing, is that what you're saying? [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1010.2s)]
*  I'm saying that, Tucker, that seems to be the function. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1011.08s)]
*  There's a group called Logically, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1013.16s)]
*  and Logically have received millions of pounds [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1014.8s)]
*  of taxpayer money. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1016.52s)]
*  And what they do is observe dissenting voices [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1018.16s)]
*  around in particular COVID and pandemic measures. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1021.44s)]
*  But they are now working in the United States, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1025.8s)]
*  apparently in order to regard misinformation [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1028.12s)]
*  around election campaigning. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1031.2s)]
*  It seems that this group received government money [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1034.6799999999998s)]
*  in order to control online spaces. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1037.72s)]
*  So if you're worried about the security [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1040.08s)]
*  of electronic voting machines or absentee ballots, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1041.8799999999999s)]
*  who are denounced by these people and censored by them. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1044.9199999999998s)]
*  That's precisely how it works. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1048.48s)]
*  And of course they employ former FBI agents, CIA agents. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1051.28s)]
*  In a way, I suppose, what happened during the pandemic period [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1056.12s)]
*  because of like the Twitter files, for example, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1058.36s)]
*  we started to learn the degree to which the deep state [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1060.48s)]
*  were involved in social media companies, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1063.1599999999999s)]
*  the degree to which they were censoring [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1065.8s)]
*  and shutting down information. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1067.1599999999999s)]
*  Information that we now know to be true, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1068.52s)]
*  which it was, of course you'll be aware [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1070.4399999999998s)]
*  that Mark Zuckerberg said we did censor true information. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1072.1999999999998s)]
*  The category in fact of malinformation [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1075.12s)]
*  is information that's true, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1077.0s)]
*  but harmful to the agenda of the powerful. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1078.56s)]
*  Well, it seems like groups like Logically [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1081.6799999999998s)]
*  and the Public Good Project are specifically empowered [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1083.8s)]
*  to control, censor, deamplify information [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1089.1999999999998s)]
*  that is harmful to that agenda. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1092.88s)]
*  This seems totalitarian. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1096.4s)]
*  Yeah. To control what people [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1100.2s)]
*  are allowed to think is, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1101.2800000000002s)]
*  I think that's the definition of it. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1102.8000000000002s)]
*  What I've started to, I suppose that's what, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1105.24s)]
*  in essence, what I've started to feel [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1108.5200000000002s)]
*  and report on consistently, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1111.5600000000002s)]
*  as you noted at the beginning of this, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1113.4s)]
*  I'm not someone who's affiliated organically [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1115.5600000000002s)]
*  with conservatism or what you might regard [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1118.6000000000001s)]
*  as right-wing politics, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1120.72s)]
*  although I of course recognize the legitimacy [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1121.72s)]
*  of a whole variety of political views [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1124.0s)]
*  and the right of people to hold different views [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1126.48s)]
*  from one another. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1128.92s)]
*  But it seems to me that authoritarianism now [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1130.2s)]
*  is being deliberately veiled in the insidious language [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1133.24s)]
*  of care, concern, safety, and convenience. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1136.72s)]
*  It seems to me that we're in a time [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1139.64s)]
*  where we lurch from one crisis to another, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1141.2s)]
*  that the crisis is always used [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1143.8s)]
*  to legitimize certain solutions. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  And a docile or terrified public [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1147.92s)]
*  is willing to participate in this proposed solutions [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1150.56s)]
*  that usually involve giving up their freedom. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1154.4s)]
*  We are continually being invited to give up our freedom [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1156.68s)]
*  in exchange for safety or convenience. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1159.84s)]
*  And it seems that this process is radically escalating. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1162.72s)]
*  And I feel that this is something [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1166.6399999999999s)]
*  that we will see yet more of in the coming year. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1168.0s)]
*  I feel like, you know, you've spoken publicly about this, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1170.2s)]
*  that we're potentially on the precipice of serious, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1173.32s)]
*  and then to use your term, a hot war with Russia. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1176.6s)]
*  And that's being reported on in my country right now. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1179.4s)]
*  It's like we're being prepped, groomed, primed [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1181.5600000000002s)]
*  for war is coming. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1184.0400000000002s)]
*  That we're being kept in a state of constant anxiety [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1185.88s)]
*  in order to induce compliance. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1189.24s)]
*  That the ongoing stoking of cultural tension [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1191.6000000000001s)]
*  is to ensure that people don't begin to recognize [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  that actually we have far more in common with one another [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1198.44s)]
*  than we do with these curious sets of establishment interests [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1201.0400000000002s)]
*  that seem to be transcendent of national democracy. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1204.24s)]
*  To be explicit, I'm talking about organizations [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1207.72s)]
*  like the WHO, NATO, the WEF, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1209.92s)]
*  and their astonishing influence. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1212.76s)]
*  Added to that the types of groups we've discussed already [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1214.4s)]
*  that have been exposed due to Lee Fang's reporting, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1216.88s)]
*  these think tanks and apparently independent organizations [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1219.48s)]
*  who are not independent when you look at [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1223.4s)]
*  where they get their money, Big Pharma, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1224.92s)]
*  or the government, or the military industrial complex, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1226.6000000000001s)]
*  or the kind of people they employ. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1228.8s)]
*  People from deep state agencies such as the FBI and CIA [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1230.68s)]
*  that have extraordinary affinity with the legacy media [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1234.2s)]
*  and their ongoing agenda. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1238.48s)]
*  So what I suppose I'm sensing is that totalitarianism now [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1239.4399999999998s)]
*  will not bear the inflections or aesthetics [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1243.6399999999999s)]
*  of the 20th century militarism, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1246.84s)]
*  guys in medals with mustaches [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1249.84s)]
*  thumping their fists on a desk. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1252.08s)]
*  We'll be calmly told by gentlemen [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1253.6799999999998s)]
*  with beautifully coiffured hair, [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1256.1599999999999s)]
*  or elegantly speaking ladies, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1258.08s)]
*  that just for our safety and just for our convenience, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  we will be returning to our homes. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1263.04s)]
*  And anyone that has an audience, or a base, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1265.0s)]
*  or an ability to communicate with people to disrupt [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1267.8s)]
*  those types of narratives will be identified and destroyed. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1270.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, they're certainly, they've identified you [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1275.56s)]
*  and they're trying to destroy you in the most obvious way, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1277.76s)]
*  in a way that hurts not just you, but your family. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1280.8s)]
*  Was there ever a moment when this happened in September [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1283.2s)]
*  where you thought, you know, it's just kind of not worth it [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1286.6000000000001s)]
*  to be doing what I'm doing. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1288.8s)]
*  This is so painful and so threatening to my family [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1290.1200000000001s)]
*  that maybe I just bow out and stop talking. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1292.3600000000001s)]
*  My son was born with a heart condition [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1295.52s)]
*  and while this was happening, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1299.08s)]
*  he was undergoing heart surgery. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1301.16s)]
*  He was 12 weeks old. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1304.6s)]
*  And I suppose what that did, Tucker, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1307.84s)]
*  is it revealed that what we were experiencing [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1312.12s)]
*  was a public concoction. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1316.44s)]
*  I am aware that I put myself [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1318.8799999999999s)]
*  in an extremely vulnerable position [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1320.56s)]
*  by being very, very promiscuous. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1322.68s)]
*  That is not the kind of conduct that I endorse [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1324.8400000000001s)]
*  and it's certainly not how I would live now. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1329.0800000000002s)]
*  That I've been shown a good many things [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1331.64s)]
*  as a result of these events, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1334.48s)]
*  the value of my family, the value of friendship, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1337.0s)]
*  the value of being able to speak publicly. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1340.28s)]
*  And I mentioned my son because throughout it, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1342.8400000000001s)]
*  I saw, I was able to maintain [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1347.6000000000001s)]
*  what is really important in life. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1350.04s)]
*  And as you have actually said, we all know how this ends. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1353.04s)]
*  Attacks like this, a crisis like this, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1357.8s)]
*  hurtful though it is to be accused of what I consider to be [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1360.12s)]
*  the most appalling crimes, to be accused of this [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1363.84s)]
*  is very, very painful and very hurtful. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1367.96s)]
*  But I am being shown that there is, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1370.8799999999999s)]
*  there are consequences for the rather foolish way [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1375.3999999999999s)]
*  that I lived in the past. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1378.68s)]
*  Although of course, again, to reiterate [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1380.0800000000002s)]
*  due to the nature of the world we live in, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1381.76s)]
*  of course I deny any allegations [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1383.72s)]
*  of the kind that have been advanced. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1386.3200000000002s)]
*  But what I've seen is the significance of family, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1388.8000000000002s)]
*  the importance of having values [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1392.4s)]
*  that are transcendent of this, the importance of God. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1395.0400000000002s)]
*  It's very easy to talk about God. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1397.64s)]
*  I talk about God all the time, but when you need God, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1399.0s)]
*  it's when the outside world shows you [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1401.76s)]
*  the reality of your powerlessness. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1404.3600000000001s)]
*  This can just happen, this can be undone, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1408.0800000000002s)]
*  this can be unspooled at you. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1410.44s)]
*  With our boy and to be in environments [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1412.76s)]
*  as you understandably and obviously are [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1414.8s)]
*  when you have a sick child, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1416.4s)]
*  you're in environments with other people [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1417.3600000000001s)]
*  that are in the exact same position. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1418.8s)]
*  And you are shown what is real [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1420.6000000000001s)]
*  and you are shown what is truthful [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1421.88s)]
*  and you are invited to look at life very differently. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1423.0800000000002s)]
*  So there are many things that I am grateful for [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1425.76s)]
*  as a matter of fact, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1428.0800000000002s)]
*  even though it's not a situation that I welcome. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1429.04s)]
*  And it's, as I say, these are allegations [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1431.0800000000002s)]
*  that I object to in the strongest possible terms. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1433.24s)]
*  The fact that it happened concurrently [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1436.36s)]
*  while I had the opportunity to see the strength [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1438.04s)]
*  and dignity of my wife and the beauty of my little son [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1439.7199999999998s)]
*  and the reality of the people that in this world [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1442.7199999999998s)]
*  that care for sick children, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1445.12s)]
*  that perform heart surgery on tiny babies, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1446.8s)]
*  shows me like, oh, look at all of these realities. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1450.12s)]
*  How can you live in the ridiculousness [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1453.08s)]
*  of their version of events? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1455.1599999999999s)]
*  I couldn't have been more open and public [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1457.0s)]
*  about the way that I lived when I was younger. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1459.04s)]
*  I was promiscuous. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1461.08s)]
*  If anyone wanted to have sex with me, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1461.9199999999998s)]
*  I would have sex with them. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1462.76s)]
*  I publicly announced it at the beginning of all shows. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1463.6s)]
*  The idea that that was some sort of a smoke screen [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1465.64s)]
*  for criminal conduct is absurd. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1468.68s)]
*  But I recognize now that unless you're willing [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1472.0800000000002s)]
*  to be a participant in these systems [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1475.0800000000002s)]
*  of compliance and distraction, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1477.5600000000002s)]
*  then you pose some kind of evident threat. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1479.8000000000002s)]
*  A big threat. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1484.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1485.2s)]
*  I mean, obviously the response proves [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1486.0400000000002s)]
*  the power of the threat that you posed and still do. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1487.68s)]
*  But again, just to quickly back to my question, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1490.5600000000002s)]
*  because this was so intense [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1493.2800000000002s)]
*  and it happened as your son was born [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1494.68s)]
*  and undergoing the surgery, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1496.72s)]
*  did it ever cross your mind like, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1499.24s)]
*  I clearly have hit the third rail and I'm out. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1501.3600000000001s)]
*  I've seen that happen a number of times. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1505.3600000000001s)]
*  Have you? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1507.2s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1508.04s)]
*  And yes, with well-known people. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1509.04s)]
*  But you didn't do that. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1511.88s)]
*  And here you are, you clearly thought about it [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1512.92s)]
*  and you've decided that you're gonna continue forward. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1515.3600000000001s)]
*  Was that a hard decision? [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1518.24s)]
*  Do you sometimes think that there is no choice? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1520.96s)]
*  You have no choice. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1522.96s)]
*  Did you ever really have? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1524.1599999999999s)]
*  Yes, I do feel that way, strongly. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1525.36s)]
*  There is no choice. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1528.28s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1529.1999999999998s)]
*  Something strange is happening. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1530.12s)]
*  Something ulterior is moving. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1531.6399999999999s)]
*  Something very important is happening. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1533.56s)]
*  I'm not purporting to be a person that lacks self-interest. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1536.4399999999998s)]
*  I feel fear, I feel anxiety. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1540.72s)]
*  I'm a recovering drug addict. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1542.9199999999998s)]
*  You know what that kind of psychological baggage [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1545.1999999999998s)]
*  that comes with. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1548.56s)]
*  But I feel like, what is the purpose here? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1550.1599999999999s)]
*  What are we doing here? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1553.56s)]
*  I've been shown to get, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1554.6799999999998s)]
*  I've in a way lived a pretty amazing life. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1555.52s)]
*  I grew up in a normal background. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1557.24s)]
*  I got super famous. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1559.44s)]
*  I experienced all of that giddiness, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1560.6s)]
*  all of that hedonism, found it empty and hollow [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1563.36s)]
*  and have been returned to a position [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1567.12s)]
*  where people could actually be connected. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1569.04s)]
*  I actually feel incredibly optimistic [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1570.9199999999998s)]
*  because of things like the ongoing agricultural protests [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1572.44s)]
*  around the world, the trucker protests, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1575.8s)]
*  the lengths that people will go to to criminalize [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1578.12s)]
*  not just an individual like me, [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1581.1599999999999s)]
*  but whole movements will be criminalized [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1582.88s)]
*  as far right as Nazi, as right, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1585.5200000000002s)]
*  as whatever language is required to delegitimize [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1587.7600000000002s)]
*  the rejection of this global authoritarianism [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1590.68s)]
*  is what will be deployed. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  So when I say, no, I didn't think for a second [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1595.24s)]
*  about doing anything different, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1598.2800000000002s)]
*  I didn't think that. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1600.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think like that. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1601.48s)]
*  And it's not out of bravery. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1602.7600000000002s)]
*  It's out of, it's something beyond that [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1605.16s)]
*  because I think sometimes I would like to just be [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1608.0800000000002s)]
*  of my little daughters and my wife and my son [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1610.1200000000001s)]
*  and just live peacefully. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1613.52s)]
*  But I don't know, Tucker, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1614.96s)]
*  it doesn't seem like there's a choice. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1616.8s)]
*  There isn't a choice. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1619.8400000000001s)]
*  There isn't a choice. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1621.0s)]
*  But even under those circumstances, some choose cowardice. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1621.8400000000001s)]
*  And again, I've certainly seen that quite a bit. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1624.44s)]
*  Dynage, you mentioned a person called Dynage. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1627.28s)]
*  Can you explain what you mean by that, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1629.8s)]
*  who this person is and what role she plays [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1633.16s)]
*  in what has happened to you? [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1635.72s)]
*  When you become accustomed to dealing with American politics, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1636.92s)]
*  it's huge sums of money, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1639.0800000000002s)]
*  it's powerful agencies that you see depicted [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1640.6s)]
*  in Hollywood movies, characters played by great movie stars. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1643.04s)]
*  And so when you return your gaze to British politics, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1646.4399999999998s)]
*  you feel like you're dealing with some sort of drudgery, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1649.24s)]
*  some sort of like some ludicrous heritage porn. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1651.6399999999999s)]
*  Who are all these dames and baronesses [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1656.12s)]
*  entitled individuals? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1658.24s)]
*  They can't be doing anything serious. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  Someone called Dame Caroline Dynage, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1661.6799999999998s)]
*  who sounds like a down and abby regular. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1663.8799999999999s)]
*  But actually though, Dame Caroline Dynage [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1667.24s)]
*  put forward the online safety bill. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1669.6399999999999s)]
*  She's married to a dude that does military PsyOps [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1671.4399999999998s)]
*  and now uses those very PsyOps with the domestic population. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1675.52s)]
*  She's the person that got in touch [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1680.04s)]
*  with the social media platforms [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1681.9599999999998s)]
*  demanding that I be demonetized. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1683.84s)]
*  They seem to have an extraordinary agenda. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1686.6799999999998s)]
*  Like what the term- [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1689.4399999999998s)]
*  Wait, can I just ask you something? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1690.28s)]
*  I looked up because I'm not as familiar [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1691.48s)]
*  with your politics as I should be. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1693.6s)]
*  I looked her up and I think what I was so struck by [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1695.48s)]
*  was that she's a member of the Conservative Party. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1698.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1701.08s)]
*  And that suggested to me that there isn't a choice [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1702.04s)]
*  in British politics. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1705.8s)]
*  There's really just one party. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1706.9199999999998s)]
*  Of course, yeah, absolutely. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1708.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a uni party. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1709.6799999999998s)]
*  But they're not even pretending at this point. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1710.52s)]
*  They're not really pretending. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1712.36s)]
*  Here's a sort of an extraordinary thing [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1714.4399999999998s)]
*  that appears to be playing out. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1716.2s)]
*  In addition to just being casually informed [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1717.36s)]
*  by the legacy media that we're on the precipice [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1720.9199999999998s)]
*  of war with Russia and that conscription [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1723.04s)]
*  might be reintroduced in 2024. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1725.56s)]
*  There was a COVID inquiry in our country, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1728.6s)]
*  which by the way, I don't imagine for a second [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1731.6s)]
*  would have happened without independent media reporting, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1733.24s)]
*  without voices like Jay Bhattacharya, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1735.2s)]
*  who was shut down, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1737.24s)]
*  or voices like Michael Schellenberg or Berenson, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1738.84s)]
*  people that have been shut down [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1741.2s)]
*  and vilified at large and extensively. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1742.6s)]
*  The COVID inquiry has already cost 145 million pounds. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1745.32s)]
*  It's been booted off and delayed indefinitely, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1748.28s)]
*  but at least until after the general election. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1751.76s)]
*  Like many countries, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1753.92s)]
*  there's an election in our country this year. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1754.8000000000002s)]
*  But as usual, it's between two neoliberal, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1757.0800000000002s)]
*  what you might term centrist parties [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1760.68s)]
*  that are ultimately dominated and controlled [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1762.8000000000002s)]
*  by the same concerns, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1764.64s)]
*  where an extraordinary focus is spent [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1765.88s)]
*  on the tiny minute differences. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1768.0800000000002s)]
*  But the party nominally of the left [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1770.2s)]
*  is ultimately a centralist neoliberal party. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1772.7600000000002s)]
*  The party nominally of the right [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1774.96s)]
*  is a neoliberal centralist party. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1776.6000000000001s)]
*  They may quibble about some issues that seem significant, [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1778.5200000000002s)]
*  and certainly those issues are stoked and amplified. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1781.8s)]
*  But neither party will say, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1784.12s)]
*  we are going to have a thorough investigation [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1785.32s)]
*  into what went on in that pandemic. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1787.2s)]
*  That clearly was a lab leak. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1789.36s)]
*  It looks like it was a bio weapon. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1791.1599999999999s)]
*  It's been concealed. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1793.2s)]
*  The people that we entrusted [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1794.32s)]
*  with our response to that pandemic [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1795.96s)]
*  are likely explicitly linked to the leak [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1797.8s)]
*  in the first instance. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1801.48s)]
*  These kind of stories are never told. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1803.0s)]
*  There are no legacy media organizations [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1805.12s)]
*  that worked in conjunction with one another [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1807.8799999999999s)]
*  to attack me evidently. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1810.04s)]
*  And by their own reckoning over a series of years, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1812.36s)]
*  they are not conducting investigations [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1814.96s)]
*  into Epstein Island. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1817.36s)]
*  They're not conducting investigations [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1819.6s)]
*  into the nature of the pandemic, [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1821.68s)]
*  how it was funded, where the money went, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1823.76s)]
*  where it came from, the efficacy of lockdowns. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1825.44s)]
*  Where are these investigations? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1827.56s)]
*  Even the fabled Times of London? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1829.24s)]
*  The fabled Times of London. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1831.56s)]
*  Such garbage. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1834.36s)]
*  It's astonishing. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1835.2s)]
*  So there's nobody in, and pardon my ignorance, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1836.04s)]
*  I'm peering in from the outside, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1838.32s)]
*  there really isn't any big media organization [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1839.84s)]
*  in your country. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1842.8s)]
*  It's even trying to answer the question, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1844.08s)]
*  what was that? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1845.48s)]
*  Where does this virus come from? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1846.32s)]
*  No one's doing that. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1847.28s)]
*  Do you know one of the things that I find terrifying [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1848.36s)]
*  about becoming more educated about this space, Tucker, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1850.0s)]
*  mostly by listening to more educated voices than my own, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1852.84s)]
*  is that many of the things a person might instinctively feel, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1857.12s)]
*  such as you feel like, you know, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1859.3999999999999s)]
*  you forgive my ignorance, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1861.04s)]
*  I don't know much about British politics, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1862.32s)]
*  but the way that one might intuit, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1864.4399999999998s)]
*  hey, should we not be provoking Russia into a war? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1865.8799999999999s)]
*  Don't they have nuclear weapons? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1868.72s)]
*  Should we think very carefully about that? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1870.32s)]
*  I mean, how much do we want Ukraine in NATO? [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1872.1200000000001s)]
*  And do we even need NATO anyway? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1874.76s)]
*  The kind of things you might think [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1876.16s)]
*  if you didn't go to university, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1877.2s)]
*  if you're a regular blue collar person, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1879.4s)]
*  working for a living, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1881.92s)]
*  maybe in the police force or the fire service, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1883.16s)]
*  or as a nurse or as a teacher, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1885.08s)]
*  something that gives real value to your nation, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1886.64s)]
*  the kind of things you might think, they're true. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1889.0s)]
*  Those ideas are true. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1891.96s)]
*  And in order to prevent you from reaching [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1893.56s)]
*  those ordinary everyday regulations, [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1895.2s)]
*  a machine is put to constant work [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1897.04s)]
*  to conquer the space of your attention, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1899.56s)]
*  incessantly and relentlessly, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1901.92s)]
*  filling your mind with dumb ideas and dumb distractions, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1903.72s)]
*  making you believe that some sugar or a screen [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1906.6s)]
*  might be a convenient palliative [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1909.8s)]
*  as your children are marched off [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1911.72s)]
*  into an unwinnable forever war. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1913.6s)]
*  You know, like, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1915.76s)]
*  like, you know, like the, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1916.6s)]
*  we've been thinking lately before, you know, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1919.6s)]
*  like with the hoofies and stuff, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1921.1599999999999s)]
*  like, and like I'm being deliberately glib, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1922.96s)]
*  but it's like you go from not ever having heard [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1925.76s)]
*  the word hoofie to being invited to hate the hoofies. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1927.72s)]
*  Oh, the hoofies, we've got to hate the hoofies now. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1930.72s)]
*  And you're like, you know, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1932.96s)]
*  just to move a battleship into that region, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1933.8s)]
*  think of the taxpayer dollars. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1936.0s)]
*  And it's not as if the pentagon [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1937.64s)]
*  are gonna be passing an audit anytime soon [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1938.8s)]
*  and telling you where this money is actually going. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1941.6000000000001s)]
*  And $2 trillion was spent on Afghanistan. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1944.28s)]
*  And if you think of the before and after picture of Afghanistan, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1947.2s)]
*  oh, well, thank God we spent that $2 trillion [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1950.2s)]
*  because before Afghanistan was, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1952.16s)]
*  and now Afghanistan is, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1954.12s)]
*  it's very difficult to fill in those sentences, isn't it? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1955.84s)]
*  And like, so what I'm saying is, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1958.84s)]
*  is like your sort of easy dismissiveness [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1960.32s)]
*  of what British politics amounts to is probably right. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1962.9199999999998s)]
*  Two corrupt parties pursuing the same ultimate end, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1966.1599999999999s)]
*  keep people tyrannized, keep people distracted, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1969.52s)]
*  keep them turned on one another over minor issues [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1972.36s)]
*  that will not ultimately affect their lives [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1975.3999999999999s)]
*  or the lives of their children [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1977.2399999999998s)]
*  so that the agenda of the powerful [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1978.76s)]
*  can be pursued without opposition. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1980.36s)]
*  War, the economy, public health, food supply, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1983.64s)]
*  water supply, I mean, these are the energy, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1988.16s)]
*  these are the things that matter. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1990.0400000000002s)]
*  And they're the things [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1991.3600000000001s)]
*  that are never discussed openly, ever. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1992.2s)]
*  Why can't we have conversations about that? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1994.76s)]
*  Like sort of with the global farming protest, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1996.3600000000001s)]
*  is it not accurately reported on? [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=1999.6000000000001s)]
*  When it is, it's reported on with a particular accent [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2001.88s)]
*  and always with the insinuation [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2005.2s)]
*  that farmers have suddenly moved their attention [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2007.1200000000001s)]
*  from the raising of crops to racism now. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2009.76s)]
*  The farming's more of a hobby. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2013.64s)]
*  I've got to return to my true love. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2015.88s)]
*  That's having strong views about varying ethnicity. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2017.48s)]
*  There's no question that a rise in nationalism [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2023.0s)]
*  is an understandable response to rampant globalism. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2026.5600000000002s)]
*  But the ongoing sort of finger pointing [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2030.3600000000001s)]
*  and condemnation of ordinary people I identify with, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2032.3600000000001s)]
*  I recognize it because I grew up in those communities. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2034.72s)]
*  Professional metropolitan people [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2037.16s)]
*  don't like working class people, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2039.0800000000002s)]
*  don't like ordinary people. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2041.2s)]
*  And now they've found a way to legitimize their hatred. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2043.12s)]
*  Oh, they're all disgusting. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2046.32s)]
*  They're all racist. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2047.8799999999999s)]
*  Look at them in their MAGA hats. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2049.12s)]
*  Look at them with their white vans and their flags. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2051.0s)]
*  Look at them with their perspectives, [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2053.64s)]
*  with their unearned views and their belches and their beer. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2055.64s)]
*  It's a kind of legitimization of a loathing [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2059.3199999999997s)]
*  of the people that are most connected to the nation. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2061.68s)]
*  People that generally speaking, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2063.68s)]
*  a couple of generations ago were asked to sacrifice [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2065.16s)]
*  the lives of their sons and daughters [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2068.08s)]
*  for the idea of nation, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2069.56s)]
*  an idea that they're now being told doesn't exist. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2070.7599999999998s)]
*  For me, what we need to see is an emergence [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2073.3199999999997s)]
*  of a different type of populism [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2075.68s)]
*  that transcends the boundaries of left and right. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2076.8399999999997s)]
*  These things are happening organically and naturally anyway. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2078.8399999999997s)]
*  And what I think is happening is, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2081.3599999999997s)]
*  perhaps it's odd, isn't it? [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2083.52s)]
*  Because the internet is ultimately [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2084.48s)]
*  a creation of the military. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2085.6s)]
*  Clearly they didn't accurately understand [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2087.04s)]
*  that whilst it was going to be a brilliant means [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2089.68s)]
*  for control and clearly that's one of the wars [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2091.72s)]
*  that's being fought now, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2093.7999999999997s)]
*  it is also a tool for informing and awakening. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2094.64s)]
*  And I think that we're at this crux point, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2098.48s)]
*  which way is it gonna go? [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2100.72s)]
*  Are people going to wake up to the reality [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  that we are being confronted with? [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2105.76s)]
*  Or are we going to sort of nervously cling on [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2107.2s)]
*  to the idea that somehow through comfort and panaceas, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2109.88s)]
*  we might hold on to some old life. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2114.0s)]
*  Increasingly I think is over. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2115.52s)]
*  I watched some of that speech you did in Ottawa [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2117.16s)]
*  or wherever you were in Edmonton, Canada. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2120.64s)]
*  And two of the things I thought were important [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2122.64s)]
*  is knowing that you are not God, you are not God. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2124.52s)]
*  It's not about you. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2128.32s)]
*  You have to have some purpose in your life. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2129.76s)]
*  And secondly, people must relearn a connection [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  to their land. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2135.28s)]
*  Our connection to our lands has been broken. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2136.4s)]
*  Now many countries, particularly in a post-colonial world, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2139.04s)]
*  have complex relationships with their land. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2141.7200000000003s)]
*  Sometimes that is a relationship with a land [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2143.6800000000003s)]
*  that had inhabitants prior to our arrival [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2146.6000000000004s)]
*  or the arrival at least of settlers in your country, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2149.92s)]
*  for example, or in Canada [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2152.36s)]
*  that you were describing outlining. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2153.96s)]
*  But we are divorced from nature. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2155.8s)]
*  We are divorced from our lands. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2157.56s)]
*  We are divorced from one another. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2159.2799999999997s)]
*  And we are fed such an empty, hollow, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2161.04s)]
*  vapid, phatic diet of lies. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2163.92s)]
*  And you said at one point, oh, you should, you know, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2167.36s)]
*  this is this vast country. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2169.68s)]
*  You could all have six acres each. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2170.92s)]
*  And I felt like, oh, the crowd responding to that. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2172.56s)]
*  People are frightened of the people of Britain [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2174.96s)]
*  or the people of America or the people of Canada [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2177.08s)]
*  or Australia or the people all over the world. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2178.64s)]
*  For surely those farmer protests are happening [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2180.52s)]
*  in Sri Lanka, they're happening in India. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2182.56s)]
*  They're not just happening in Europe [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2184.2s)]
*  or Anglophonic countries. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2185.92s)]
*  They're happening everywhere. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2186.92s)]
*  They're happening everywhere. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2188.64s)]
*  And I feel that that's precisely the direction [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2189.92s)]
*  we need to return to. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2192.48s)]
*  Sovereignty of the individual, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2193.6s)]
*  sovereignty and sanctity of the connection [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2195.28s)]
*  between people and their land. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2197.6800000000003s)]
*  Maximum amount of power in your own life [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2199.16s)]
*  and the life of your community and your loved ones. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2202.04s)]
*  Not this transition of power [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2204.76s)]
*  to increasingly centralized forces [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2207.36s)]
*  and this infantilization and neutralization [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2209.56s)]
*  and castration of individual and familial power. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2213.48s)]
*  Can I ask you a question that you may be able to answer [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2216.2s)]
*  that I've been meditating? [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2218.52s)]
*  I'll give it a go, Tucker. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2220.24s)]
*  I'll tell you that. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2221.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, you're just uniquely positioned to answer [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2222.12s)]
*  because you've seen both sides. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2223.4399999999996s)]
*  So the things that the people in charge hate include nature [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2225.52s)]
*  and the class of people who are most useful [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2229.3599999999997s)]
*  to your nation, you described them. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2232.8399999999997s)]
*  Cops, firemen, teachers, nurses, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2234.7599999999998s)]
*  all of them are crushed during COVID by the way. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2237.4399999999996s)]
*  And farmers. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2240.12s)]
*  And it's indisputable that if you don't have those people, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2241.3999999999996s)]
*  you don't have a society. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2243.3599999999997s)]
*  You could get rid of everything tank [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2244.92s)]
*  and every sociology department [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2246.56s)]
*  and every liberal arts university, you'd probably be okay. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2247.84s)]
*  You get rid of your farmers, you starve to death. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2250.08s)]
*  So it's not obvious why the leadership of a country [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2251.92s)]
*  would hate the very people they need most [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2254.7200000000003s)]
*  and hate the most beautiful and valuable thing they have, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2257.48s)]
*  which is nature. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2259.48s)]
*  Why do they hate those things? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2260.44s)]
*  It terrifies me to contemplate, Tucker, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2264.12s)]
*  that people like Alex Jones and in our country, David Icke, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2267.76s)]
*  who aside from some views that are impossible to corroborate [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2273.5200000000004s)]
*  around quite occultist and shall we call them marginal ideas, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2277.84s)]
*  difficult to corroborate ideas, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2281.8s)]
*  when it comes to the subject of globalization [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2284.6800000000003s)]
*  and the increasing authoritarianization of our planet, [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2287.5200000000004s)]
*  appear to have been ahead of the curve. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2290.6800000000003s)]
*  You can see them 20, 30 years ago saying [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2294.0s)]
*  with the empowerment of NATO, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2296.8s)]
*  the empowerment of world banks and the WHO, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2298.32s)]
*  it's extraordinary. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2301.92s)]
*  And it seems to me that the disempowerment [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2303.56s)]
*  of ordinary people, the condemnation, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2307.92s)]
*  the demoralization of the public, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2309.8s)]
*  to create people that just are weary and broken [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2312.88s)]
*  and if not enslaved, then so dependent [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2316.6s)]
*  it amounts to a form of slavery, cannot be inadvertent. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2320.4s)]
*  It seems to be a denial of something fundamental [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2324.8s)]
*  that in my language, I would call spirit, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2328.6s)]
*  the right to be who you are, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2331.16s)]
*  that there isn't something fundamentally ugly [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2333.56s)]
*  or wrong with you, that you are allowed to be who you are. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2335.68s)]
*  And I see that as a universal principle [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2338.7999999999997s)]
*  that will be applied all the way from the left to the right [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2340.72s)]
*  across various ways that people claim [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2343.2799999999997s)]
*  their individual identity now. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2345.4s)]
*  It seems to me that yes, that if you start to attack [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2347.36s)]
*  those pivotal infrastructural roles, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2349.68s)]
*  I'm struck when speaking to some of the people [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2351.64s)]
*  that you work with, man, as you know, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2353.2s)]
*  that's been a cop for 26 years in New Jersey, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2355.4s)]
*  35 years in the security services. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2358.56s)]
*  But these people that give their lives for a country, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2361.2400000000002s)]
*  so to tell those people that your country [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2364.1200000000003s)]
*  doesn't mean anything or to alter the meaning [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2367.1200000000003s)]
*  of what a nation is or alter what your contribution has been, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2369.28s)]
*  it seems to be about a kind of disorientation [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2372.48s)]
*  and it's difficult actually sometimes. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2375.1200000000003s)]
*  The reason I mentioned at the beginning [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2376.48s)]
*  of this rather corroming answer, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2377.6400000000003s)]
*  figures that are broadly condemned as conspiracy theorists, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2379.2400000000002s)]
*  but then aren't we all these days, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2382.76s)]
*  the reason I mention them is because they talk [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2385.56s)]
*  specifically about ideas to do with spirituality, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2387.52s)]
*  morality and ethics. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2391.0s)]
*  And it's hard for someone like me to consider [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2392.92s)]
*  that the goals of this global establishment [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2395.04s)]
*  are anything other than power, finance, dominion. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2397.52s)]
*  But when you talk about this loathing of nature, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2400.72s)]
*  whether that's human nature or botany or the great expanse, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2403.44s)]
*  it's difficult to think that there isn't something dark. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2407.24s)]
*  Yes! [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2410.88s)]
*  At its core. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2411.72s)]
*  Because there's no rational explanation for that. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2414.0s)]
*  How could you want to despoil nature? [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2416.96s)]
*  How could you hate human nature? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2420.0s)]
*  How could you want to hurt people? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2422.32s)]
*  Those are not rational responses to anything. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2424.48s)]
*  I mean, there's gotta be, I mean, clearly [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2427.44s)]
*  what we're watching are the fruits of spiritual war. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2430.12s)]
*  If you're gonna give a better explanation, let me know. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2433.0s)]
*  Certainly the solution seems to me to be spiritual [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2434.88s)]
*  and even when they're talking about ecology [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2437.28s)]
*  and evoking words like Gaia, like the spirit of the planet, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2439.4s)]
*  it seems oddly utilitarian. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2442.84s)]
*  The earth is a resource, even when claiming to care [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2445.2s)]
*  about the types of energy industry [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2448.7999999999997s)]
*  that might be most beneficial [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2451.16s)]
*  and those which might not be as beneficial. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2452.64s)]
*  I don't see reverence. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2455.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't see an acknowledgement of the sacredness of the earth. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2457.7999999999997s)]
*  That the earth is not a resource. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2461.8799999999997s)]
*  It's not, you know, obviously the left and right [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2464.48s)]
*  are classically almost at this point, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2467.0s)]
*  divided around the subject of climate change. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2468.72s)]
*  And what I feel is who among us [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2470.9199999999996s)]
*  ought not love our planet and behave respectfully [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2474.0s)]
*  and reverentially and lovingly to our planet? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2477.28s)]
*  And how is that gonna happen [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2479.48s)]
*  if no one has a relationship with it? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2480.52s)]
*  I think like 90% of, in my country, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2482.12s)]
*  90% of the land is inaccessible to most people. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2484.12s)]
*  90% of the land is privately owned. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2487.52s)]
*  Like land that used to be commonly held [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2489.6s)]
*  is now all privately owned. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2491.84s)]
*  There has been successive law after successive law [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2493.36s)]
*  that has moved power and control and the land [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2496.0s)]
*  and nature herself into the hands of an elite. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2498.2s)]
*  And it's this, I suppose, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2500.92s)]
*  even where it would have been risible that- [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2502.12s)]
*  Getting back to feudalism. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2503.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2505.04s)]
*  That's what you're saying. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2505.8799999999997s)]
*  Let's get back to good old feudalism. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2506.72s)]
*  What was wrong with feudalism? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2507.8799999999997s)]
*  Why are we making such a fuss about it? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2510.08s)]
*  The idea that you and I are people that operate [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2512.24s)]
*  on different sides of a political spectrum [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2515.3199999999997s)]
*  becomes exposed as ridiculous [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2517.64s)]
*  when the anti-authoritarian aspect [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2519.9199999999996s)]
*  of what we both clearly believe in [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2523.2799999999997s)]
*  has to become the clear and pivotal point [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2525.16s)]
*  around which all political views [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2528.4399999999996s)]
*  have to now start to coalesce. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2530.52s)]
*  You are either going to oppose what's happening [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2532.24s)]
*  when it comes to globalization [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2535.56s)]
*  and centralized authoritarianism [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2536.8799999999997s)]
*  or you are going to be crushed by it [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2538.56s)]
*  individually and collectively. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2540.3199999999997s)]
*  How do you see, and I'll stop with this, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2543.64s)]
*  compound question. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2546.04s)]
*  How are your family and friends holding up [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2546.8799999999997s)]
*  in the face of this assault on you and your family? [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2549.08s)]
*  And how do you see this playing out, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2552.24s)]
*  the battle that you just described? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2554.8799999999997s)]
*  Are you hopeful or no? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2556.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, because I've been subject to personal attacks, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2558.16s)]
*  it's very, one thing, like I have a program of recovery. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2561.0s)]
*  I've been in recovery for 21 years. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2565.28s)]
*  It's, in a sense, it's what enshrines [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2567.12s)]
*  and helps me practice my relationship with God. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2570.48s)]
*  It's the most important thing to me. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2572.52s)]
*  The thing I have to most be observant of [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2574.76s)]
*  and have to keenly avoid is descent into self-centeredness. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2576.84s)]
*  When I am very frightened, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2580.84s)]
*  it's very easy for me to drift into [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2583.32s)]
*  becoming quite myopic and insular. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2585.96s)]
*  What I've observed, like in this period, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2589.0s)]
*  from a personal perspective, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2591.24s)]
*  is that I'm incredibly fortunate. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2592.8399999999997s)]
*  I've got an amazing wife. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2595.72s)]
*  I've got amazing, beautiful children [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2596.7599999999998s)]
*  that are healthy and doing well. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2599.2799999999997s)]
*  I've got incredible people that I work with. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2601.04s)]
*  Like, oh my God, and another thing that's been amazing [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2603.64s)]
*  is like for a month, publicly, continually, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2606.04s)]
*  I was like, you know, called the worst names [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2608.7999999999997s)]
*  you can call a man. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2610.3599999999997s)]
*  And then I'd go out in public and people are like, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2611.92s)]
*  Russell! [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2613.52s)]
*  Hey! [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2614.3599999999997s)]
*  We support you, we support you! [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2615.3599999999997s)]
*  One time I was with a family with all their daughters [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2617.72s)]
*  that were aged between 15 and 19. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2620.32s)]
*  Oh, can you do photos of our daughters? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2621.96s)]
*  I was thinking if there were one group [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2623.24s)]
*  that would be negatively affected [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2624.52s)]
*  by what's just been publicly said about me, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2626.0s)]
*  it would be the parents of teenage kids. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2627.8s)]
*  And people aren't. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2630.8s)]
*  People aren't buying it. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2632.04s)]
*  People aren't buying it. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2633.4s)]
*  That's the problem. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2634.88s)]
*  People are waking up. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2635.92s)]
*  People are starting to think, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2637.0s)]
*  well, Jesus, is there going to be a better example [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2637.92s)]
*  than your former and perhaps future president? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2641.2s)]
*  The more they hate him, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2644.24s)]
*  the more people like him. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2645.88s)]
*  The more people like him because what they know is [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2648.44s)]
*  they don't trust the establishment anymore. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2650.52s)]
*  They cannot trust the establishment anymore. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2653.28s)]
*  Speaking from the perspective, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2656.92s)]
*  look, this isn't the first time I've known personal crisis. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2658.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm a drug addict in recovery. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2660.32s)]
*  I'm a product of a single parent family. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2661.32s)]
*  I've come from, I'm a normal person [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2663.1600000000003s)]
*  from a normal background. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2664.48s)]
*  But what I would say is that in a sense, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2666.56s)]
*  a crisis becomes an invitation. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2668.52s)]
*  A catastrophe is an invitation. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2670.2400000000002s)]
*  And it seems like whether you're on the left or right, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2672.4s)]
*  everyone believes catastrophe is coming [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2675.08s)]
*  and it will be an invitation. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2677.16s)]
*  It will be an invitation because if what we're being offered [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2678.7999999999997s)]
*  is a slow grind into endless war [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2682.04s)]
*  and more and more authoritarianism [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2684.48s)]
*  and more and more control of our personal lives [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2686.2s)]
*  and our ability to worship, our ability to affiliate, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2688.0s)]
*  our ability to pray, if what we're being invited to accept [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2691.92s)]
*  is the colonization of the self, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2696.08s)]
*  of our ability to think freely, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  then what we got to lose when all they're offering us [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2699.44s)]
*  is more war, endless pandemics [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2702.12s)]
*  that are being legislatively enshrined even now [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2704.68s)]
*  through the WHO treaty. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2707.24s)]
*  What have we actually got to lose? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2709.24s)]
*  I think in a sense, perhaps they are, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2711.8399999999997s)]
*  if there is one God, one all powerful God, [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2714.6s)]
*  then surely that God is at work now. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2717.56s)]
*  And surely that God is creating the perfect conditions [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2719.8799999999997s)]
*  for our mutual awakening. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2723.3199999999997s)]
*  And perhaps what's required is the spur, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2725.08s)]
*  the ignition of something so unbearable [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2728.12s)]
*  that people will awaken rather than endure it, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2731.3999999999996s)]
*  rather than endure it any further. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2734.16s)]
*  And perhaps that's what we're being offered now. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2736.2s)]
*  Yes, of course it seems like we're on the precipice [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2738.2799999999997s)]
*  of catastrophe geopolitically [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2740.72s)]
*  and from various potential health pandemics, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2742.44s)]
*  but also it seems to me like a potential offering to awaken. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  And I don't think we have any choice [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2748.56s)]
*  other than to see it that way. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2750.3199999999997s)]
*  So, Brian, you have not been broken. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2752.2s)]
*  You are at your very best, your very best. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  And I really appreciate it. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2756.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2757.04s)]
*  Thanks, Tucker. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2757.88s)]
*  Free speech is bigger than any one person [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VnNf0azNTQ&t=2764.12s)]
