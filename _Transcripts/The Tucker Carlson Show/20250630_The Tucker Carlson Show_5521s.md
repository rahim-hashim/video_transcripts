# RFK Jr. Provides an Update on His Mission to End Skyrocketing Autism and Declassifying Kennedy Files
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA)
*  Well, here's a story you probably haven't heard a lot about. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=0.0s)]
*  The Chinese mafia is exploiting rural America to create a drug empire. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  This is not available on cable news. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=7.66s)]
*  The network's not telling you about this, but it's totally real. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=10.68s)]
*  Communist affiliated drug gangs destroying parts of the United States, the parts that [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Washington ignores, to sell drugs, laundering money and building a black market network [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=17.18s)]
*  inside this country's most beautiful but least served areas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=23.38s)]
*  We've got a brand new documentary on this. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=29.0s)]
*  It's called High Crimes, the Chinese Mafia Takeover of Rural America. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=31.04s)]
*  It's available now on tuckercarlson.com. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=35.58s)]
*  It's excellent. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=37.84s)]
*  The purchase of churches and schools to aid the operation, the jerry-rigging of power [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=39.24s)]
*  boxes to steal electricity, foreign pesticides, collusion with the Mexican cartels. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  By the way, one of the drug houses is like walking distance from my house. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=53.0s)]
*  It's a layered and fascinating story. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=54.379999999999995s)]
*  Head to tuckercarlson.com to watch now. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=56.44s)]
*  We think you'll love it. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=59.36s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=60.36s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=85.92s)]
*  I remember the night that Trump won talking to people in Washington and their doomsday [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=87.2s)]
*  scenario, the thing that they feared more than North Korea getting the bomb was you [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=93.64s)]
*  becoming Secretary of Health and Human Services. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=96.72s)]
*  They really were afraid because they felt it was a threat not just to them but to the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=99.36s)]
*  whole business of the city. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=104.92s)]
*  And I think a lot. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=106.68s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason they felt that way and they probably still do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=107.68s)]
*  So what's that been like? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  What's the opposition been like, the organized opposition to your program? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=112.12s)]
*  Well, you know, the irony is I'm not really getting opposition directly from the industry. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=116.0s)]
*  Most of the industry wants things from this department. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=121.72s)]
*  And we want to get, you know, we want American industry to profit. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=128.2s)]
*  The pharmaceutical companies, everything else. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=131.6s)]
*  And so, and I think they know that and they know that we're working with them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=135.24s)]
*  They also know they've been getting away with stuff up till now and that era is over. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=142.48s)]
*  I get opposition from proxies to the industry. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think the major opposition that I feel is from the mainstream media and from Democrats, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=155.56s)]
*  which is really, that is an interesting phenomenon because these were people I was friends with [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=165.88s)]
*  my whole life. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=171.76s)]
*  And, you know, I am not changed and my values have not changed. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=173.76s)]
*  And the policies that I've been advocating have not changed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=178.24s)]
*  But the party has just a knee-jerk reaction against anything that is Trump. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=184.84s)]
*  And you know that. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=190.32s)]
*  And, you know, President Trump's in this kind of really paradoxical position where he not [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=191.8s)]
*  only has completely taken over the Republican Party and dictates its platform, but he's [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  also dictating the platform for the Democratic Party. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  I've noticed. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=209.56s)]
*  Oh, if, you know, if I remember, I saw this for the first time on NAFTA. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=210.56s)]
*  Democrats traditionally were against NAFTA. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  And as soon as President Trump came out against NAFTA, all the Democrats were now for NAFTA. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=221.0s)]
*  The Democrats were the anti-war party. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=227.92s)]
*  But as soon as he expressed his opposition to the Ukraine war, they became the war party. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=230.16s)]
*  The Democrats traditionally were the biggest critics of the CIA and the intelligence agencies. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=236.76s)]
*  And as soon as President Trump started complaining about the power of the intelligence agencies [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=244.4s)]
*  in Washington, they became bonded with the intelligence agencies to the extent where [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=250.32s)]
*  they had for the first time in history a former CIA director speaking at their convention [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=256.84s)]
*  immediately before Kamala Harris. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  They were the party of free speech. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=270.2s)]
*  And they became, you know, when President Trump started advocating for free speech and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=273.64s)]
*  his ability to talk, you know, the shutdowns of him on Twitter and these other really crazy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=278.32s)]
*  efforts to suppress the speech of a former president. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=288.2s)]
*  He became a major advocate of free speech, and the Democrats are now openly for censorship. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=294.12s)]
*  The Democratic Party was the party of women's sports. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=302.6s)]
*  My uncle wrote Title IX, making sure that women had the right to and had the equal access [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=307.04s)]
*  to the resources that they could play sports. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=314.32s)]
*  And the Democratic Party has become, you know, the party that is now the enemy of women's sports. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=319.88s)]
*  And you can go on and on with those examples. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=331.0s)]
*  President Trump is literally dictating the platform of the Democratic Party, anything [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  that he says they're going to be against. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=340.71999999999997s)]
*  And you know, that is also a departure from tradition. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=344.08s)]
*  My father was very critical of partisanship. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=347.68s)]
*  I remember him telling us when we were kids, I don't vote for the Democratic Republic, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=352.76s)]
*  I vote for the person, whoever is supposed best in the job. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=357.4s)]
*  And you know, that partisanship by its nature is dishonest, and it is the enemy of democracy. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=362.36s)]
*  And that in Washington, George Washington's farewell speech, he said that he said he was [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=372.72s)]
*  very scared of the right, frightened about the rise of the political party because they [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=376.92s)]
*  would become self-interested rather than patriotic. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=382.6s)]
*  It would be interested, they would become interested in promoting their own agendas. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=386.92s)]
*  Rather than the agenda of the country. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=392.12s)]
*  And he thought that that was a real threat to American democracy and to the end of this [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=393.91999999999996s)]
*  great experiment that we have in democracy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=399.71999999999997s)]
*  I remember your first break with the Democratic Party and with personal friends, even members [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=406.76s)]
*  of your family, was a Rolling Stone piece that you wrote about autism, asking why have [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  autism rates risen? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=415.71999999999997s)]
*  And you were kind of written out of police society for doing that. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=417.67999999999995s)]
*  One of the first things you did as secretary, I think, tell me if I'm misstating it, is [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=421.32s)]
*  commissioned a kind of study of autism. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=425.0s)]
*  Can you tell us what that is? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=427.0s)]
*  What are you seeking to do with that? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=428.67999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, the studies, there are a handful of studies that CDC has generated [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=430.11999999999995s)]
*  on autism. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=437.64s)]
*  They were all epidemiological studies. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=439.4s)]
*  And they all say what the CDC wanted them to say is they couldn't find a link. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=442.28s)]
*  The problem is that the Institute of Medicine, which is part of the National Academy of Sciences, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=447.88s)]
*  had said in 2001 that the link between autism vaccine is biologically plausible. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=454.36s)]
*  And they were highly critical of the way that CDC was making decisions about the vaccine [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=462.68s)]
*  schedule, that it was, you know, this group, ACIP, which is an external panel, which has [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=471.4s)]
*  the responsibility of deciding which new vaccines will be added to the schedule. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=480.2s)]
*  They had essentially been captured by industry, the people who serve on that panel, almost [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=486.44s)]
*  all of them have financial entanglements with the industry. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=490.84s)]
*  And the Institute of Medicine recommended a litany, a retinue of studies, including animal [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=497.32s)]
*  models, observational studies, bench studies, and epidemiological studies. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=504.76s)]
*  They said you need this whole retinue to answer this question. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=516.04s)]
*  CDC never did those. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=519.72s)]
*  Instead, it commissioned the creation of these six epidemiological studies, and none of them [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=521.96s)]
*  does what all of them are. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=528.36s)]
*  They use fraudulent techniques. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=531.16s)]
*  You know, they say statistics don't lie, but statisticians do. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=532.76s)]
*  And epidemiological studies are very easy to manipulate. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=537.08s)]
*  None of those studies did what you would do if you wanted to find the answer, which is [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=541.0s)]
*  to compare outcomes in a fully vaccinated group to health outcomes in an unvaccinated group. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=546.52s)]
*  And CDC did that study in 1999. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=554.12s)]
*  They brought in a team of scientists under a Belgian researcher named Thomas Verstraten, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=559.64s)]
*  and they looked at the data. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=569.16s)]
*  They looked at children who had received the hepatitis vaccine within the first 30 days of life [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=571.0s)]
*  and compared those children to children who had received the vaccine later or not at all. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=578.76s)]
*  And they found an 11, 135 percent elevated risk of autism among the vaccinated children. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=584.84s)]
*  And it shocked them. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=593.32s)]
*  They kept the study secret, and they manipulated it through five different iterations. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=594.6s)]
*  To try to bury the link. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=601.0s)]
*  And, you know, we know how they did it. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=602.28s)]
*  They got rid of all the older children, essentially, and just had younger children who were too [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=604.12s)]
*  young to be diagnosed. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=608.92s)]
*  And they stratified the data, and they did a lot of other tricks. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=611.24s)]
*  And all of those studies were the subject of that kind of trickery. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=616.68s)]
*  And so what we're going to do now, and meanwhile, the external literature is showing, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=622.2s)]
*  you know, over 100 studies that indicate that there is a link. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=627.8000000000001s)]
*  But what we're going to do now is we're going to do all the kind of studies that the [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=634.36s)]
*  Institute of Medicine originally recommended. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=640.36s)]
*  And we're going to do observational studies, retrospective studies, and epidemiological [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=643.4s)]
*  studies. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=648.52s)]
*  We're going to do real science. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  And the way that we're going to do that is we're going to make the databases public for the first [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=651.72s)]
*  time. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=656.52s)]
*  We've gone into CDC. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  We've gotten the data from CMS, which is Medicaid and Medicare. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=659.8s)]
*  We're getting the data from the Vaccine Safety Data Link, which is the biggest repository [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=664.36s)]
*  for HMO health records. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=668.84s)]
*  So those records would have all the records of vaccination and then the subsequent health [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=671.88s)]
*  claims. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=678.1999999999999s)]
*  And you can do a cluster analysis and look and see if there's an association. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=678.68s)]
*  But and we're going to do some in-house studies ourselves. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=683.64s)]
*  More importantly, we're going to make this data available for independent scientists so [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=687.2399999999999s)]
*  everybody can look at it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=692.4399999999999s)]
*  And then we have already put out grant requests. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=693.64s)]
*  The general scientific communities of any scientist with credentials can apply for a grant [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=702.12s)]
*  and tell us how they want to go about studying these. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=709.56s)]
*  And so we're going to get real studies done for the first time. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=712.44s)]
*  And we should have some answers by September, some initial indicator answers. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=718.0400000000001s)]
*  And then it'll take over the next six months, these large studies by independent scientists [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=725.0s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=730.6s)]
*  We anticipate there'll probably be about 15 different major teams who are all trying to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=731.4000000000001s)]
*  answer this question. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=735.96s)]
*  And within six months, we'll have definitive answers after September. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=738.2800000000001s)]
*  You get home from work on a Friday night, you're psyched because you finished the entire [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=742.44s)]
*  week of work. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=745.96s)]
*  It's time to reward yourself. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=746.6s)]
*  So you go to the snack cabinet and 10 minutes later, you've consumed an entire bag of chips, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=748.84s)]
*  your typical American chip brand, and you feel like garbage. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=755.5600000000001s)]
*  Of course you do. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=760.2s)]
*  You just stuffed hundreds of calories of chemically laced seed oil infused crap into your mouth. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=761.32s)]
*  This is not a good way to start the weekend. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=767.24s)]
*  And who has it done it? [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=769.6400000000001s)]
*  Cast the first stone, but there is a better way. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=771.64s)]
*  It's called masa chips. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=774.84s)]
*  And we have mountains of them in our house. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=777.0s)]
*  Actually, if so many, they're in our garage. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=779.64s)]
*  We bring them in every day and hit them hard. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=781.08s)]
*  And they're great. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=783.88s)]
*  And you can feel good about eating them. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=784.52s)]
*  They're delicious. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=786.12s)]
*  And unlike the rest of this country's corrupted food supply, masa chips have no seed oils [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=787.0s)]
*  whatsoever. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=793.24s)]
*  In fact, they have almost nothing in them except a few basic ingredients. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=794.2800000000001s)]
*  Check the label. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=798.9200000000001s)]
*  And you feel the difference. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=800.5999999999999s)]
*  So they're not bad for you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=802.76s)]
*  And they are delicious. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=804.1999999999999s)]
*  So the total package, they're beloved by thousands and endorsed by nutrition experts [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=805.3199999999999s)]
*  around the country. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=809.48s)]
*  Masa is the way to go. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=810.28s)]
*  Masa, visit masachips.com slash Tucker. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=811.88s)]
*  Use the code Tucker for 25% off your first order. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=814.92s)]

*  You're going to love them. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=821.48s)]
*  And is it your expectation that those answers will differ from the kind of status quo understanding? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=822.4399999999999s)]
*  I think they will. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=828.28s)]
*  My opinion, I always tell people, is irrelevant. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=831.0s)]
*  We need to stop trusting the experts. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=839.32s)]
*  We were told at the beginning of COVID, don't look at any data yourself. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=842.2s)]
*  Don't do any investigation yourself. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=847.32s)]
*  Just trust the experts. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=849.08s)]
*  And trusting the experts is not a feature of science. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=850.36s)]
*  It's not a feature of democracy. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=856.6s)]
*  It's a feature of religion. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=859.96s)]
*  And it's a feature of totalitarianism. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=861.48s)]
*  In democracies, we have the obligation, and it's one of the burdens of citizenship, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=864.76s)]
*  to do our own research and make our own determinations about things. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=871.32s)]
*  Mothers, when they go shopping, they don't trust the advertising. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=875.16s)]
*  A good mother does not trust the advertising. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=879.64s)]
*  They don't trust what they hear. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=882.2s)]
*  They do their own research. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=884.6800000000001s)]
*  And it's a much harder way to live. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=885.96s)]
*  But that is one of the burdens of living in a democracy, is that we do our own research. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=887.5600000000001s)]
*  We make up our own minds. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=893.88s)]
*  And that's the way it should be done. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=897.1600000000001s)]
*  And we're going to give people gold standard science. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=899.64s)]
*  We're going to publish our protocols in advance. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=902.2s)]
*  We're going to tell people what we're doing. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=906.36s)]
*  And then we're going to use data. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=909.4000000000001s)]
*  And we're going to publish the peer reviews, which is never published by CDC studies. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=912.68s)]
*  We're going to publish any time that we can the raw data. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=920.52s)]
*  And then we're going to require replication of every study, which never happens in NIH now. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=924.5999999999999s)]
*  That's something new that we're bringing in, is that every study will be replicated. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=932.68s)]
*  I thought that was like a basic precept of science. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=938.76s)]
*  We can't know something unless the experiment showing it can be replicated, right? [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=941.16s)]
*  Yeah, that is a basic precept of science. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=946.1999999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, it has the kind of science that was done by NIH. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=949.8s)]
*  NIH was the gold standard agency when I was a kid. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=957.56s)]
*  But they stopped doing that. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=961.9599999999999s)]
*  And it incentivized a lot of cheating. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=963.56s)]
*  And the reason it incentivizes cheating is that if you're a scientist, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=966.6800000000001s)]
*  your career depends on how much you publish. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=973.72s)]
*  And so if you have a hypothesis and you say, this is my hypothesis, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=978.36s)]
*  this is the study that I want to do, and you get a grant from NIH, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=984.0400000000001s)]
*  and the hypothesis turns out to be wrong, you know, it doesn't, the science does not support it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=988.76s)]
*  A lot of times you cannot get that study published. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=996.6800000000001s)]
*  That's science. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1000.6800000000001s)]
*  It's science when you, you know, a null hypothesis is science, and it ought to be published, but the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1001.88s)]
*  journals won't do it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1009.72s)]
*  And also the journals won't publish anything that is critical of vaccines. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1010.76s)]
*  They won't do it because there's so much pressure on them. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1018.76s)]
*  They're funded by the pharmaceutical companies, and they'll lose advertising, they'll lose [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1021.64s)]
*  revenue from reprints if they don't do that. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1030.92s)]
*  So even Marcia Engel, who is a long time, I think 25 years at the New England Journal of Medicine, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1033.32s)]
*  she said, you can't believe anything that's in the scientific journals anymore. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1041.08s)]
*  Richard Horton, who's the longtime editor of the Lancet, is the same thing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1044.84s)]
*  He says, we've become propaganda vessels for the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1048.84s)]
*  And the pharmaceutical company, now you have to pay to get something published in these journals. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1053.3999999999999s)]
*  And so the pharmaceutical companies pay for something. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1059.1599999999999s)]
*  They give a, you know, they hire these, you know, these mercenary scientists, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1062.04s)]
*  we call them by ostitudes, to do a study that will validate their product and, you know, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1066.4399999999998s)]
*  say that this statin drug works against heart attacks, and they'll mess with the data because [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1073.6399999999999s)]
*  they want it published, they're being paid by the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1077.88s)]
*  And then once it's published, the journal will make available preprints. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1082.5200000000002s)]
*  The preprint is a little, like a little magazine with the logo of the Lancet on the front. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1089.72s)]
*  And it has that one article that says, this statin drug works or this SSRI works. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1097.0800000000002s)]
*  And then they have tens of thousands of pharmaceutical reps who will take those [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1103.24s)]
*  journal articles and go to every doctor's office in the country and say, you know, and they're [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1108.04s)]
*  usually, let me put it this way, hot looking women or, you know, and they'll go take the doctor out [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1112.52s)]
*  to lunch, they'll say, you know, why don't you start prescribing this drug? And they'll incentivize [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1120.92s)]
*  the doctor in all kinds of ways to do that. And so the doctors also have their own incentives, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1126.92s)]
*  you know, perverse incentives. There's a published article out there now that says that [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1132.92s)]
*  50% of revenues to most pediatricians come from vaccines. And then there's a whole structure [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1141.24s)]
*  where Blue Cross and the other insurance companies pay bonuses to the pediatrician to make sure if, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1150.68s)]
*  for example, 95% of their, if their clients are fully vaccinated, they get a huge bonus. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1158.3600000000001s)]
*  It can be tens of thousands of dollars. And that's why your pediatrician, if you say, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1165.0800000000002s)]
*  I want to go slow on the vaccines or I want to have a little different schedule, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1170.8400000000001s)]
*  your pediatrician will throw you out of his practice because you're now jeopardizing that [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1175.32s)]
*  bonus structure. And these are all perverse incentives that stop doctors from actually [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1181.0s)]
*  practicing medicine and caring for the client because they're looking at the bottom line. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1187.08s)]
*  20 years ago, 20% of the doctors in this country worked for corporations. Today, 80% do. And that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1194.36s)]
*  corporation is telling you, you know, we don't care what happens to your patient. We care about [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1203.96s)]
*  how much revenue you're generating. And these doctors are coming out of medical schools with [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1211.32s)]
*  ginormous bills that will bankrupt them if they don't have a job. And so they're under tremendous [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1218.44s)]
*  pressure just to keep generating those funds. And the whole system, as you know, is, it's just a [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1227.8s)]
*  bundle of perverse incentives that, you know, where everybody is making money by keeping us sick, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1234.52s)]
*  you know, and I'm not saying that's deliberate or purposeful or, you know, planned in any way. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1243.24s)]
*  It's just the incentive system that everybody makes money. The insurance companies make money [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1251.8799999999999s)]
*  if you're sick, ironically. They make more money if the population is sick. And, you know, that may [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1257.64s)]
*  seem counterintuitive to people. And a guy said to me once who worked for AIG, one of the big [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1263.88s)]
*  insurance companies, he said, I said, I want to go with some data to AIG and show them that, you [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1270.5200000000002s)]
*  know, what they're doing is actually, I can show them on paper, what they're doing is actually [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1278.2800000000002s)]
*  making their people sicker. And they're the one group that you would think would want healthy [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1284.12s)]
*  people because they'd have to pay out less. And this guy said to me, think of it this way, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1289.2399999999998s)]
*  if you're Lloyds of London and you insure all the shipping in the world, is it better for you if one [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1295.08s)]
*  ship sinks a year or if 500 sinks a year? And I said to him, it's better if only one sinks. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1302.4399999999998s)]
*  He said, no, it's better if 500 sinks because then everybody has to get insurance. And what the [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1311.16s)]
*  insurance companies are collecting money and money is friction. They're taking a cut of the revenues [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1316.04s)]
*  that come through them. The more people that buy insurance, it doesn't matter what the claims are. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1322.8400000000001s)]
*  If the claims are high, they just raise their premiums. And it's the amount of money that flows [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1327.64s)]
*  in the system that gives them money. So they're making money that way. The doctors are making [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1333.56s)]
*  money from keeping us sick. The hospitals are making money from keeping us sick. The [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1337.64s)]
*  pharmaceutical companies are making money from keeping us sick. So every level of the system [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1343.16s)]
*  is incentivized financially, no matter what your intention is. If you're a doctor, of course, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1351.0800000000002s)]
*  you don't want sick patients. But there's tremendous pressure from every angle of the system to [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1355.96s)]
*  actually to keep us all sick. And we're now the sickest nation in the world. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1363.16s)]
*  Last year, we did an interview with a woman called Casey Means. She's a surgeon educated at Stanford. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1371.0s)]
*  She's the nominee for Surgeon General right now. She really is one of the most amazing people I [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1376.6000000000001s)]
*  have ever met. The interview made me emotional. In it, she explained how the food that we eat, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1382.52s)]
*  produced by huge food companies in conjunction with pharma, is wrecking our health and wrecking [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1386.8400000000001s)]
*  this country, making it weak and sick. She's the co-founder of a healthcare technology company [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1391.48s)]
*  called Levels, and we're proud to partner with them. And by proud, I mean, actually proud, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1396.1200000000001s)]
*  for real. Most of us are not metabolically healthy. Even worse, we're not aware that we're not. We [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1400.84s)]
*  have no idea where our health stands. As we speak now, we don't know how to improve it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1406.28s)]
*  With Levels Labs, you'll get insight into your health to help you understand where you are to [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1411.16s)]
*  measure and optimize your wellbeing. It is the best thing you can do to get a picture of [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1416.04s)]
*  where your health stands and how to make it better. The Levels app works with something called the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1423.08s)]
*  Glucose Monitor, CGM. And now the Levels membership comes with a 28 marker cardio metabolic blood test, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1426.92s)]
*  giving you a comprehensive view of your health with clear guidance on how to improve it. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1434.36s)]
*  You can also get the extended panel, which gives you an even more detailed view with 100 plus [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1438.68s)]
*  biomarkers, real-time personal data. So you take control of your health for the better. You know [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1443.8s)]
*  what happens when you eat certain things. We just got word that Levels is offering, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1449.08s)]
*  this shows listeners annual memberships with an additional two free months through the website. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1452.76s)]
*  The website is levels.link.tucker. That's levels.link.tucker, two months free. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1457.6399999999999s)]
*  One of the reasons that there hasn't been much of a discussion, you said there were signals in 1999 [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1464.2s)]
*  that there was a connection between autism and vaccines. The response from the American [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1469.16s)]
*  media was just to throw you out, take away your New York Times presence, ban you from Rolling [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1473.88s)]
*  Stone, etc., attack you as a Nazi. You made the point years later that the reason that happened [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1477.96s)]
*  was because pharmaceutical companies are the single biggest source of revenue for a lot of [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1484.3600000000001s)]
*  media companies and they're buying the protection with that money. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1488.0400000000002s)]
*  And that's another perverse incentive, right? [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1491.88s)]
*  Absolutely. I think we're one of only two countries in the world that allow that. Can that be stopped? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1494.6s)]
*  That's a question that we are looking at right now. There's a bad Supreme Court case from a [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1504.84s)]
*  couple of years ago that essentially anointed pharmaceutical advertising with First Amendment [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1513.08s)]
*  protection. The First Amendment protects political speeches. If you're saying something [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1521.8s)]
*  political, you should have absolute protection under the First Amendment. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1531.08s)]
*  Commercial speech has a lower level of protection. And the pharmaceutical advertising was regulated [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1538.36s)]
*  as commercial speech and it was until 1990, really around 1992. You didn't see pharmaceutical [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1548.52s)]
*  advertisements. There was no direct to consumer advertising on TV. And after that, and then there [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1557.8s)]
*  were more changes made in 1997, that's when it exploded. And today, Roger Ailes, who both you and [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1564.76s)]
*  I knew, I had this very Roger Ailes for your audience who doesn't know him, which I think most of them do, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1574.6s)]
*  was the founder of Fox News. And I had this odd relationship with him because politically we were [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1583.0s)]
*  at loggerheads, but I had spent, when I was 19 years old, I spent three months with him in a tent in Africa. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1589.08s)]
*  And we developed a friendship then and as you know, he was very engaging [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1597.9599999999998s)]
*  guy. He was very witty, really fun to be with, very paranoid, but at the same time, brilliant. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1604.6s)]
*  And so he was very kind to me. He was a very loyal friend to me and he would make [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1615.8799999999999s)]
*  Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly and Neil Cavuto and all the other hosts, your former colleagues, [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1623.08s)]
*  wouldn't be on TV to talk about the environment, even though he didn't agree with me on it. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1630.1999999999998s)]
*  He made them put me on. So during the 80s and 90s, I was the only environmentalist who was going on [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1634.36s)]
*  Fox News. But I brought him one time this, I think it was like 2014, I brought him a [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1641.56s)]
*  documentary that we had done about mercury and vaccines. And he had, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1654.36s)]
*  he watched it. He was completely sold on it. He had a family member who had been affected, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1660.28s)]
*  he felt. And he said, I can't put you on because if I did, if any of my hosts allowed you on to [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1667.8799999999999s)]
*  talk about this issue, I would have to fire them. And if I didn't, I would get a call from Rupert [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1677.1599999999999s)]
*  within 10 minutes. And he said, for the evening news division, about 75% of the advertising [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1683.16s)]
*  revenues are coming from pharma. And then he told me something that if I remember it correctly, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1690.92s)]
*  he said that on a typical evening news show, there are 22 ads and 17 of those are pharmaceutical ads. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1697.32s)]
*  And so this was the principal source of revenue. And for a lot of these television networks, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1706.68s)]
*  it's keeping them alive. As you know, they're all kind of collapsing financially. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1711.24s)]
*  Yeah, collapsing due to lack of popular demand for their presence. So could you end that? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1715.4s)]
*  Do you have the authority as the Secretary of Health and Human Services to say no more [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1721.16s)]
*  pharma ads on television? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1725.96s)]
*  Well, you know, a lot of the pharmaceutical ads are misleading. Yeah. And even the music and the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1727.16s)]
*  video, the photos that they show, the scenes that they show, that's kind of speech and it's [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1744.6s)]
*  misleading and sending a message. And if you take this drug, you're going to be riding jet [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1750.28s)]
*  strisks, skis and playing volleyball and water skiing. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1755.8799999999999s)]
*  Have a great looking spouse. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1762.76s)]
*  The side effects meanwhile are rolling at 80 miles an hour and that's misleading. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1766.2s)]
*  And so one of the things that we're looking at is making them [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1772.52s)]
*  be more honest about what they show. So that the public is, you know, this pharmaceutical [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1781.3200000000002s)]
*  advertising is insidious for a number of reasons. That's why they don't allow it anywhere else in [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1790.68s)]
*  the world. New Zealand has a very, very limited allowance of direct consumer advertising, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1797.4s)]
*  very, very highly controlled compared to us. It's nothing. People who come over here from England [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1802.92s)]
*  or Europe and watch our TV are shocked by what they're seeing on it. And it's insidious because [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1809.16s)]
*  of this. The pharmaceutical advertisers are advertising the most expensive version of every [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1814.44s)]
*  drug. They're not going to advertise the generics because they're not making any money. So they're [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1820.76s)]
*  advertising the ones that are the highest profit margins for them. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1826.12s)]
*  Normally, if you see an advertisement on TV, like for Coca-Cola, you then have a choice to go get [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1830.84s)]
*  that and then you're paying out of your pocket for it. When somebody buys a pharmaceutical drug, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1838.52s)]
*  it's Medicaid and Medicare that are paying for it. It's us, it's the taxpayer. So they're [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1844.9199999999998s)]
*  advertising something to the consumer when the consumer has no skin in the game. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1851.88s)]
*  And then the consumer, and we're paying for the ads because they're tax deductible. So there, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1857.4s)]
*  we're paying for them to advertise and advertisements are getting people to buy drugs [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1864.8400000000001s)]
*  that may be ineffective, that may be the least effective drug of the ones that are available. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1870.3600000000001s)]
*  And then they go to their physician. The physician is told by his boss, who's the [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1876.68s)]
*  corporate bean counter, you have 11 minutes with each patient and that's it. And the physician then [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1885.0800000000002s)]
*  can spend that 11 minutes trying to talk the patient out of something that they want and then [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1894.28s)]
*  the patient's going to go away unsatisfied. Or the physician could just say, all right, you want this [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1900.44s)]
*  prescription, I'll write it for you. And then, you know, patient is then going to come back [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1906.52s)]
*  because he's happy. The doctors hate it. The American Medical Association has been against it [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1910.76s)]
*  for, you know, for 30 years. And nobody thinks that this is good for public health. It is hurting us [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1917.6399999999999s)]
*  and it's distorting the markets. And it is not, it's not, you can't even call it a free market [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1925.0s)]
*  because everything's paid for by the federal government. So here's a company we're always [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1932.76s)]
*  excited to advertise because we actually use their products every day. It's Merriweather Farms. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1937.64s)]
*  Remember when everybody knew their neighborhood butcher? You look back and you feel like, oh, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1942.2s)]
*  there was something really important about that. Knowing the person who cut your meat. And at some [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1946.44s)]
*  point your grandparents knew the people who raised their meat so they could trust what they ate. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1951.72s)]
*  But that time is long gone. It's been replaced by an era of grocery store mystery meat boxed [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1957.48s)]
*  by distant beef corporations. None of which raised a single cow. Unlike your childhood, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1962.04s)]
*  they don't know you. They're not interested in you. The whole thing is creepy. The only thing [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1969.0s)]
*  that matters to them is money and God knows what you're eating. Merriweather Farms is the [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1973.32s)]
*  answer to that. They raise their cattle in the U.S. in Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1977.08s)]
*  and they prepare their meat themselves in their facilities in this country. No middlemen, no [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1981.6399999999999s)]
*  outsourcing, no foreign beef sneaking through a back door. Nobody wants foreign meat. Sorry, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1987.32s)]
*  we have a great meat, the best meat here in the United States, and we buy ours at Merriweather [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1992.6799999999998s)]
*  Farms. Their cuts are pasture raised, hormone free, antibiotic free, and absolutely delicious. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=1996.9199999999998s)]
*  I gorged on one last night. You got to try this for real. Every day we eat it. Go to [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2002.84s)]
*  merriweatherfarms.com. Use the code TUCKER76 for 15% off your first order. That's merriweatherfarms.com [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2007.8s)]
*  slash tucker. So if in starting in September when we start to see the results of the analysis of [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2016.2s)]
*  these massive data sets that you're putting out there in public, and if it becomes clear that [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2023.1599999999999s)]
*  there is a connection between autism and vaccines, vaccines the government promoted in some cases [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2028.84s)]
*  effectively required, that's a tort. I mean, that means there are a lot of injured people [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2034.68s)]
*  who can now show they were injured by this product. How were they made whole? What happens to them? [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2040.2s)]
*  That's going to be complicated because in 1986, Congress passed an act, the Vaccine Act, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2046.6000000000001s)]
*  the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, and they gave the vaccine companies immunity from [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2054.8399999999997s)]
*  liability. So no matter how reckless the company is, no matter how toxic the product, no matter how [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2064.9199999999996s)]
*  egregious your injury, you cannot sue them. And that's one of the problems. And that actually is [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2074.7599999999998s)]
*  one of the reasons we had this explosion of the vaccination program. When I was a kid, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2083.6400000000003s)]
*  we only had three vaccines. And by 1986, the year the act was passed, there were 11 doses of, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2090.28s)]
*  I think, five vaccines. And today there are a child to go to school in states like California [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2101.16s)]
*  and New York and many other states where you have mandates. An American child now has to receive [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2113.48s)]
*  between 69 and 92 vaccines between conception, so some of those are given to the mom during pregnancy. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2122.12s)]
*  And age 18. And the reason it's 69 to 82 is some of the vaccines have, the different brands have [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2131.7999999999997s)]
*  different dose requirements. So some will require three doses, some will require one dose, some will [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2141.3999999999996s)]
*  require four doses. But that's a lot of vaccines for a kid. And each one of those is calculated, [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2146.8399999999997s)]
*  is designed to permanently alter your immune system. And so we have now this epidemic of [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2154.6s)]
*  immune dysregulation in our country, you know, and there's no way to rule out [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2163.08s)]
*  vaccines as one of the key culprits. And if you look at all of these diseases that have become [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2170.44s)]
*  epidemic, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, all of these seizure disorders, the neurological [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2175.64s)]
*  disorders like ADD, ADHD, speech delay, language delay, tics, Tourette syndrome, narcolepsy, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2185.0s)]
*  ASD, autism, all the diseases. UNN, I never saw when we were kids. And suddenly they're, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2192.44s)]
*  this generation is damaged, is incredibly damaged by all these disease. The autoimmune diseases [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2200.2s)]
*  like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, the allergic disease like peanut allergies, anaphylaxis, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2207.16s)]
*  eczema. Did you ever know anybody with eczema? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2214.2s)]
*  No. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2217.0s)]
*  Right. So, and now it's ubiquitous in every classroom. And all of those injuries are listed [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2217.72s)]
*  as side effects on the manufacturer's inserts of those products. Oh, we would be, have to be blind [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2225.56s)]
*  to not say we have to look at this as a potential culprit. We have to do the studies that the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2236.36s)]
*  Institute of Medicine has been telling the CDC to do for 25 years. The Institute of Medicine, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2242.44s)]
*  and old CDC in 2013, there are 158 injuries that are suspected to be vaccine injuries. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2249.32s)]
*  Only 38 of those have been studied. And almost most of those, it was positive. It was, yeah, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2260.44s)]
*  this is a vaccine entry. The other 120, whatever, and I'm not doing the math, but [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2266.2000000000003s)]
*  the others have never been studied. CDC's job is to study them, and yet it never studied them. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2274.12s)]
*  And that was purposeful. And I'm not saying that out of speculation. I'm saying that because I've [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2281.3999999999996s)]
*  seen the emails. And CDC deliberately derailed any study on that. And if somebody does, independent [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2287.24s)]
*  scientists does do a study, they can't get it published. The scientific publishers will not [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2297.8s)]
*  publish a study that is critical of vaccine. So we need to change that taboo. And that's one of the [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2303.88s)]
*  things Jay Bhattacharya is doing at NIH is we're going to remove the taboo about talking about this [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2310.44s)]
*  issue. And we're going to be honest with the American public. It's pretty clear from the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2317.0s)]
*  VAERS, the Self-Reporting Vaccine Injury System, federal system, that vaccine injuries with the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2320.84s)]
*  COVID Vax jumped to multiples of what had been reported before. There were more injuries reported [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2326.92s)]
*  from VAERS by the COVID vaccine than all other vaccines put together for the past 36 years. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2336.44s)]
*  And I'll tell you something else. There's a lot of people out there who say, you know, this is part [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2346.36s)]
*  of the consensus. You'll see this on every mainstream. Anderson Cooper, Jake Tapper, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2353.0s)]
*  all of these guys say again and again that the link between autism vaccines has been debunked, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2363.64s)]
*  right? It's been studied. But those studies that I was talking about earlier, the epidemiological [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2371.48s)]
*  studies, they only looked at one vaccine, the MMR, and one ingredient, thimerosal. None of the [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2377.16s)]
*  vaccines that are administered to children during the first six months of life have ever been studied [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2385.8799999999997s)]
*  for autism. In fact, the Institute of Medicine said that they looked at this issue, you know, [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2394.6s)]
*  has it been debunked? And they said no, these studies have never been done on the vaccines [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2400.2s)]
*  that are the most likely culprit, which is, you know, DTaP, FB, IAB, pneumococcal, the vaccines [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2406.2s)]
*  group in the first six months, none of them. They said the only one that has ever been studied is [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2414.12s)]
*  DTaP, which is diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. And they said that the one study that was done [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2419.96s)]
*  showed that, yeah, there was a link with autism, but we're not going to count that study [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2429.48s)]
*  because it was based on the VAERS system, which is CDC's only surveillance system. And they said [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2433.72s)]
*  that system is too unreliable. So what they were saying, the Institute of Medicine, which is part [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2441.24s)]
*  of the National Academy of Sciences, said that the only system that CDC has to study vaccine injury [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2446.6s)]
*  is so bad that any study done on it, we're not going to count. I'll tell you something else. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2454.3599999999997s)]
*  David Kessler, who was a very famous surgeon general, who you remember, and many, many, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2463.7999999999997s)]
*  many other people have said that VAERS system does not work and you need a new system. So in 2010, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2469.9599999999996s)]
*  CDC designed a new system and it was a machine counting system. The problem with VAERS, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2478.2799999999997s)]
*  with the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, is that it's voluntary. And so the doctor has to, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2483.0s)]
*  if he sees a vaccine injury, he's required to report it to VAERS. But there's no penalty if [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2492.04s)]
*  he doesn't. It takes him a half an hour to fill out the paperwork. So there's a big incentive for [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2499.64s)]
*  him not to do it. There's another incentive, though. He doesn't know if something is a vaccine [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2505.3199999999997s)]
*  injury. If you get a vaccine and then four years later you come in with a food allergy, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2510.7599999999998s)]
*  how do you know? Will any doctor in the world say that's a vaccine injury? Or seizure disorders? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2518.84s)]
*  And the other thing is, so they don't know what to look for. They've never been taught that at [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2526.36s)]
*  medical school. There's no course on vaccine injury in medical school, in any medical school [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2531.2400000000002s)]
*  in this country. And then the other thing is he has a big emotional incentive because he told that [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2537.08s)]
*  mom to give that child that vaccine. And if the child has a seizure three weeks later and she comes [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2543.88s)]
*  back and she says, I think it might be the vaccine, a lot of doctors will say, no, that's normal for [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2551.56s)]
*  that age. And they're not going to call it into VAERS. So CDC designed a machine counting system [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2558.28s)]
*  that would do essentially cluster analysis. They would look at the vaccine and then they would look [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2566.44s)]
*  at clusters of injuries that were unique or anomalous to that vaccine. It was a very accurate [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2571.0s)]
*  system according to the group that designed it. It was a team led by a guy called Lazarus. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2577.88s)]
*  And CDC paid for the whole thing, millions of dollars. And it was a long-term study. And they [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2585.16s)]
*  looked at one HMO, which was Harvard Pilgrim up in Massachusetts. And they did this machine [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2591.0s)]
*  counting system for Harvard Pilgrim. And then they compared what the machine counting system had [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2599.72s)]
*  yielded and collected in terms of vaccine injuries. They compared that to what VAERS had collected [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2608.8399999999997s)]
*  during the same period at Harvard Pilgrim. And they said that VAERS was capturing fewer than [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2614.12s)]
*  1% of vaccine injuries. And they had a system now that would capture over 95%. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2623.24s)]
*  And they were very proud and they brought it to CDC and said, our system works, here's the data. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2631.4799999999996s)]
*  As the data showed, injuries in about 2.7% of vaccines. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2637.7999999999997s)]
*  Of all vaccines? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2643.24s)]
*  Yeah, all vaccines, about 2.7%. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2644.4399999999996s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2646.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2647.2599999999998s)]
*  Which I think is something like one out of every 37 vaccines you get, there's an injury. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2648.46s)]
*  And CDC saw that and said, we're not going to use the system. And they shelved it in 2010. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2654.38s)]
*  And they've continued to use VAERS now for 22 years when they know that it doesn't work. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2662.7799999999997s)]
*  When you bring it back? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2668.7s)]
*  It is designed to fail. We're going to absolutely change VAERS and we're going to make it. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2669.5s)]
*  We're going to create either within VAERS or supplementary to VAERS, a system that actually [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2676.46s)]
*  works. And right now, even that system is antiquated because we have access to AI. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2684.54s)]
*  And we are creating here at HHS an AI revolution. We've been able to attract the top people from [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2693.66s)]
*  Silicon Valley. People have walked away from billion-dollar businesses. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2703.02s)]
*  And they don't want prestige. They don't want position. They don't want power. They want to [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2706.86s)]
*  change. They want to make the system work. And we're going to, we are at the cutting edge of AI. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2710.38s)]
*  We're implementing it in all of our departments. At FDA, we're accelerating drug approvals. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2719.2599999999998s)]
*  So you don't need to use prime aids or even animal models. You can do the drug approvals very, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2726.94s)]
*  very quickly with AI. And we're also implementing it at CMS to detect waste, abuse, and fraud, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2732.54s)]
*  which is extraordinary at that. But we're also going to use it at CDC and throughout our system [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2741.1s)]
*  to look at the mega data that we have and be able to make really good decisions about [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2753.42s)]
*  interventions. For example, if you look at the population as a whole and say, okay, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2759.18s)]
*  we're using three different diabetes drugs or five different statin drugs or all these SSRIs and [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2764.7799999999997s)]
*  others, you can then look drug by drug and you can tell on the population whether it's working or [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2772.06s)]
*  not and which one is giving you the best bang for the buck and which one has the most side effects. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2777.98s)]
*  Oh, we have a potential now to use AI in ways that are going to revolutionize medicine. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2784.14s)]
*  You've probably heard about 8 Sleep. Lots of people are talking about it. It is a company [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2789.8999999999996s)]

*  Pod 5. It's an original and innovative mattress cover plus a blanket that uses precision [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2806.06s)]
*  temperature control to regulate your body's sleep cycles and give you the perfect sleep, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2812.22s)]
*  which really, really matters. It can range all the way from 55 degrees to 110 degrees, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2816.54s)]
*  meaning that you're covered no matter what. It's like electric blanket to the next level, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2823.18s)]
*  but also a cooling blanket. So it makes you sleep better. Temperature has a massive effect [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2827.1s)]
*  on the way you sleep. By the way, it also detects snoring. And then it adjusts your bed position to [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2833.1s)]
*  reduce or completely stop it. So there are a lot of ladies in America who are going to be grateful [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2841.66s)]
*  for this product. Everybody who works here will tell you because they all use it, that there's [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2846.06s)]

*  of them. I know a lot of them. Some died. Some were permanently disabled. Nobody seems to care. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2876.62s)]
*  You never hear about them and they don't seem to be getting any help. Will that change? [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2883.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's going to change. I mean, as I said, the big impediment is [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2890.06s)]
*  the 1986 Vaccine Act. And so it's complicated about how we fix this so that we can get compensation [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2894.7s)]
*  to those people. We just brought a guy in this week who's going to be revolutionizing the [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2906.06s)]
*  the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which is a program that when Congress passed the [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2914.94s)]
*  Vaccine Act and gave immunity from liability to vaccine companies, it recognized that vaccines [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2925.42s)]
*  were in the description, the characterization of the American Academy of Pediatrics were [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2932.78s)]
*  unavoidably unsafe. And some people, like for every medicine, some people are going to be [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2942.94s)]
*  injured and killed. And so it set up a program that's in the federal government, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2949.02s)]
*  called the Vaccine Courts, and they have a trust fund. The trust fund is endowed by a 75% [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2956.62s)]
*  surcharge on every vaccine. And that program is supposed to there's supposed to be a vaccine [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2964.46s)]
*  court that's supposed to be generous and fast and give the tie to the runner. In other words, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2970.54s)]
*  if there's doubts about, you know, whether somebody's injury came from vaccine or not, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2975.2599999999998s)]
*  you're going to assume they got it and compensate them. And it's paid out over $5 billion now to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2980.14s)]
*  about 12,000 people. And we're looking at ways to enlarge that program so that COVID vaccine [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2989.74s)]
*  injured people can be compensated. And we're changing the program so that, you know, we're [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=2997.98s)]
*  looking at ways to enlarge the statute of limitations, only three years, a lot of people [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3004.78s)]
*  don't discover their injuries. So after that, and the there's no discovery in that program, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3009.98s)]
*  there's no rules of evidence. The program has default into lawyers from the justice, you're not [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3017.42s)]
*  suing the vaccine company, you're you're petitioning the my agency, and it's represented traditionally [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3025.74s)]
*  by the Department of Justice. And the lawyers in the Department of Justice, the leaders of it were [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3032.2999999999997s)]
*  corrupt. And they were they saw their job as protecting the trust fund rather than taking [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3039.2599999999998s)]
*  care of people who made this national sacrifice. And we're going to change all that. And I've [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3047.2599999999998s)]
*  brought in a team this week that is starting to work on that this week. So you know, that's one [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3053.5s)]
*  of the things we're doing, but we're looking at everything. What's the status of the COVID [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3059.26s)]
*  facts now? Who gets it? What are the recommendations? And why? The recommendations now are that [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3062.38s)]
*  children under 18 are not recommended to get the vaccine, but they can get it if they want, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3073.42s)]
*  you know, it's through a joint consultation with their physician. Oh, it's available to them. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3079.66s)]
*  There is an and you know, there's a new version of the COVID vaccine that just came out [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3090.8599999999997s)]
*  that was approved by FDA and that vaccine is going to actually do real clinical trials. So [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3098.7s)]
*  and it's being given to people who are 65 years older or have profound comorbidities. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3105.34s)]
*  But the agreement with the company is that everybody who takes it will be part of a [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3114.2200000000003s)]
*  clinical trial. So we'll actually get some real data. And as you know, there was just data chaos [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3118.5400000000004s)]
*  with the other vaccine. In fact, you know, that the Pfizer vaccine, when it came out, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3123.5s)]
*  it had a higher all cause mortality. So more people died in the placebo group. I mean, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3130.94s)]
*  more people died in the vaccine group than in the placebo group. I had 20,000 people who got the [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3141.1s)]
*  vaccine, 20,000 who didn't. And after six months, they looked at it and there was 23% more deaths [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3146.94s)]
*  in the vaccinated group from all causes than in the placebo group. And the efficacy was [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3154.38s)]
*  kind of dubious. Well, yeah, there was only two people who died from COVID in the placebo group. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3162.06s)]
*  And there was one person who died from COVID in the vaccine group. And that's the whole data [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3170.94s)]
*  set they were looking at. And so they said, you remember, they were saying the vaccine is 100% [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3174.86s)]
*  effective. Well, that's why they were saying it because there was two is 100% of one, right? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3181.1s)]
*  100% larger than one. So that's what they had. But what they were telling the American people is 100% [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3190.22s)]
*  effective. And when people heard that, they thought if you get the vaccine, you can't get COVID, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3196.06s)]
*  which of course now everybody realizes was wrong because everybody got COVID, whether they got the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3202.06s)]
*  vaccine or not. And, you know, what they really should have been telling people is that in order [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3208.62s)]
*  to prevent one death from COVID, you had to give 19,999 vaccines. If any of those vaccines were [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3217.66s)]
*  killing people, you would cancel out the effect of, you know, the beneficial effect. Do you think [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3226.2999999999997s)]
*  the COVID, I mean, net, as we say in business, just kidding, do you think overall the COVID [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3231.2599999999998s)]
*  vex killed more than it saved? My opinion about that is irrelevant. What we're going to try to do [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3238.06s)]
*  is make that science available so the public can look at the science. And I would not say one way [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3245.5s)]
*  or the other. And the truth is, I don't know. And the reason I don't know is because the studies [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3252.22s)]
*  that were done by my agency were substandard and they were not designed to answer that question. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3259.9s)]
*  And there's been a lot of obfuscation about covering up, as you know, about suppressing [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3266.06s)]
*  any kind of discussion of vaccine injuries. I mean, Mark Zuckerberg publicly said that he was [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3275.34s)]
*  ordered by the White House to suppress anybody on his platform, on Facebook or Instagram, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3285.82s)]
*  who mentioned vaccine injuries. Oh, he was ordered by the Biden administration [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3292.62s)]
*  to, and he said, you know, he said, I was stunned. I was being ordered by the federal government [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3299.42s)]
*  to deny facts. Anybody can look him up on YouTube saying that. So, and we know that too, because I [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3304.7s)]
*  sued the Biden administration and we got all this discovery documents that showed that he was, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3313.18s)]
*  37 hours after he took the oath of office, swearing up all the Constitution, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3318.3s)]
*  he opened up a group in the White House whose job it was to suppress any dissent about, you know, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3327.1800000000003s)]
*  this government policy. And I was the first person that they went after. 37 hours after [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3335.9s)]
*  he took that oath, they were telling Facebook to take me off of Instagram, which Facebook did. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3344.86s)]
*  I had almost a million followers and there was no vaccine misinformation on there. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3350.94s)]
*  I asked Facebook again and again, show me one fact I got wrong. Everything I put on there that, you [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3356.3s)]
*  know, was vaccine related, was cited and sourced to government databases or to peer reviewed [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3362.6200000000003s)]
*  publications. And, but they were, you know, it was not, it wasn't misinformation. In fact, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3367.98s)]
*  they had to invent a new word, which is because Facebook was saying to the White House, this isn't [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3378.54s)]
*  misinformation. It's actually true. And the White House said, well, it's malinformation. Malinformation, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3385.34s)]
*  this is an Orwellian kind of construct. And, you know, malinformation is information that is [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3393.5s)]
*  actually true, but it is nevertheless inconvenient for the government. And they, you know, they just [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3399.34s)]
*  all the people who are now running this agency were censored. O.J. Bhattacharya was censored. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3406.86s)]
*  Marty McCary was censored. Dr. Oz was censored. Vinay Prasad was censored. We were all sent. I [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3412.14s)]
*  was censored. I remember well. What's the status of the COVID vaccine pregnant women? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3417.5s)]
*  The recommendation has been removed now for pregnant women. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3424.22s)]
*  Are you satisfied that mRNA technology is safe for people? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3429.18s)]
*  I'm not satisfied. You know, again, you know, my opinion about that is irrelevant, but we will be [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3432.7s)]
*  doing those studies. And I would say there's a lot of skepticism in this agency about mRNA vaccines, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3439.98s)]
*  you know, about mRNA technology, about the status of it now, about whether it's safe. And we do not, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3447.26s)]
*  you know, the safety studies simply have not been done, but there is enough anecdotal reports of [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3457.1000000000004s)]
*  people getting profound injuries that may or may not be associated with it. And we're going to [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3462.2200000000003s)]
*  answer those questions. What happened with the vaccine board? I keep reading you [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3471.5s)]
*  fired all these eminent scientists on the vaccine. Yeah, I fired all these what? [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3476.78s)]
*  All these important, highly credentialed scientists. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3482.7s)]
*  Well, we fired that board because they were, it was utterly, it was just an instrument. It was a [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3487.02s)]
*  sock puppet for the industry that it was supposed to regulate. So, you know, they, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3493.26s)]
*  and this was a long time coming, Tucker, in 2002, the government oversight committee in the United [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3503.9s)]
*  States Congress held hearings about that board, which is called ASAP advisory committee on [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3512.5400000000004s)]
*  immunization practices. And they said that 97% of the people on that board and undisclosed conflicts, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3517.58s)]
*  many of them that disclose conflicts as well. But they said that Congress said that it gave [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3529.5s)]
*  an example and said the rotavirus vaccine was approved by that board. And there were five [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3536.86s)]
*  members of that board at that time, and four of them had direct financial interests in the rotavirus [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3546.62s)]
*  vaccine. They were working for the companies that made the vaccine or they were receiving grants to [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3553.58s)]
*  do clinical trials on that vaccine. They all had overwhelming financial interests. One of the people [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3560.38s)]
*  on that board was a guy called Paul Offit, and who is one of the big voices for vaccines that they CNN [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3567.98s)]
*  goes to him all the time when it wants to know about vaccines. He voted to add the rotavirus [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3576.22s)]
*  vaccine to the schedule when he had a rotavirus vaccine in development. Because it's now on the [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3582.9399999999996s)]
*  schedule, his developing vaccine is virtually guaranteed to get on the schedule. It's a [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3589.3399999999997s)]
*  competitive product. But once you say rotavirus vaccine has to be vaccinated for his vaccine is [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3593.66s)]
*  now guaranteed to get on the schedule, the one they voted on that he voted on within a year, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3600.2999999999997s)]
*  it had to be withdrawn because it was causing this really disastrous disease in kids that is [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3605.98s)]
*  often lethal called insusception, agonizingly painful when your intestines kind of tie up [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3611.5s)]
*  against each other. It kills children on occasion. That vaccine was pulled the following year and his [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3618.7s)]
*  vaccine then replaced him. He was still on the committee. He didn't vote on that, but he was [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3627.82s)]
*  still on the committee. But he voted to make rotavirus vaccine mandatory for the schedule. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3632.46s)]
*  And he then he and his business partners, Stanley Plotkin and a couple of other people sold that [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3636.62s)]
*  vaccine and to Merck for $186 million. He told Newsweek that he won the lottery. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3645.9s)]
*  Oh, it's been said of him that he voted himself rich. So that and that kind of conflict was [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3654.54s)]
*  typical on that committee. But the most did people know this was going on? That that's such an obvious [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3660.86s)]
*  the Office of Inspector General in this department, I investigated and they said this is a disaster. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3668.38s)]
*  You got to change it. Congress investigated and said you got to change it. And they did nothing. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3674.6200000000003s)]
*  That's the most most sort of glaring example of medical malpractice by this [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3681.34s)]
*  by this group is that they approved all these vaccines. We went from 11 remember to 69 to 92. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3689.26s)]
*  11 vaccines in 86 and not one of them had except for COVID. COVID is the only one [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3698.3s)]
*  that had a pre-licensing safety trial that involved a placebo, a true placebo. And so all [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3706.2200000000003s)]
*  of those other vaccines were ushered in without safety studies. And that means nobody understands [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3713.58s)]
*  the risk profile of those products. How can you do that? That's they did it. It's corruption. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3720.46s)]
*  And it's you know, it's because of agency capture. It's because the companies that were making these [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3726.38s)]
*  products and if you can get your vaccine on the schedule, it's it's generally typically about a [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3733.1s)]
*  billion dollars a year for your company because you now have a trap market with no downside. No, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3740.62s)]
*  you've got an immediate issue. First of all, the federal government oftentimes actually [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3746.38s)]
*  designs the vaccine. NIH would put design it. It would hand it over the pharmaceutical company, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3751.58s)]
*  the pharmaceutical company then runs it through ACIP and runs it first through FDA then through [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3757.98s)]
*  ACIP and gets it recommended. If you can get that recommendation, you now got a billion dollars [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3764.46s)]
*  in least revenues by the end of the year, every year, forever. So there was you know, there was a [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3771.1s)]
*  gold rush to add new vaccines to the schedule and this and ACIP never turned away a single vaccine. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3779.42s)]
*  Everyone that was that came to them, they you know, recommended. And a lot of these vaccines are for [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3786.22s)]
*  you know, they recommended the hepatitis B vaccine for babies when they're an hour old, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3793.98s)]
*  the first day of life they get that and you know, hepatitis B if your mother's got it, [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3799.9s)]
*  you should get it. And you can you know, you can pass through maternal transmission. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3804.46s)]
*  But every mother that goes to the hospital in this country, they're going to get it. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3810.46s)]
*  And you know, they're going to get it. And you know, they're going to get it. And you know, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3814.22s)]
*  you can pass through maternal transmission. But every mother that goes to the hospital in [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3818.22s)]
*  this country is tested for it. So we know which ones you know, are vulnerable, which aren't. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3823.5s)]
*  But the mass vaccination of the entire population, including wild children, this is a disease. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3829.2599999999998s)]
*  You get through sexual transmission or you get it from sharing needles. And particularly, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3835.58s)]
*  it was prevalent among promiscuous gay men. But a one day old baby, the risk to a one day old baby [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3842.14s)]
*  was one in seven million. Very few of whom are promiscuous. Very few of them are you know, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3852.62s)]
*  are involved in prostitution or drug addiction. So you know, but it was a financial, they were all [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3860.7000000000003s)]
*  they were all financial drivers. So and a lot of the diseases that they target are not diseases, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3868.54s)]
*  the vaccine itself does not prevent transmission. And so, you know, the justification for having it [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3878.7s)]
*  mandated is, is very ephemeral. And you know, these are all things that we need to look at. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3886.86s)]
*  And we want to protect public health, but you know, that means protecting against chronic disease, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3894.7s)]
*  too. And you know, these vaccines have, there's nobody who will contest that they cause, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3899.98s)]
*  that they can cause chronic disease, chronic injuries that last a lifetime. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3907.5s)]
*  So one of the reasons that the system has become so corrupt, I think it's fair to say, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3912.7799999999997s)]
*  is Anthony Fauci, one of the longest serving federal employees, who was the subject of one [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3916.46s)]
*  of the best selling books of a couple of years ago, which you wrote the real Anthony Fauci and [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3921.3399999999997s)]
*  amazing book. And all this information about him was exposed to the world. And he gets some [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3924.38s)]
*  signing care at Georgetown, it's still a Secret Service protection. He seems to be thriving. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3930.94s)]
*  He doesn't have a Secret Service protection any longer. President Trump took that away from him. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3935.1s)]
*  But good. He, he, you know, he is, he got immunity. Why did he need immunity? You know, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3941.1s)]
*  why did he need a pardon in advance? What do you think the answer is? [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3951.34s)]
*  You know, I would be speculating, but I think he, I think there, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3959.5s)]
*  I think he was vulnerable. I think he had a lot of liability on creating coronavirus. You know, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3965.98s)]
*  he was funding precisely that research at the Wuhan lab. And he was giving them the technology. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3973.42s)]
*  He was giving them, you know, he gave them not only the technology, the precise technology for [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3982.7000000000003s)]
*  developing that pathogen and published about it, by the way. And, you know, the publications credit [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3989.1800000000003s)]
*  NIH for the, for the, for the, for the, for financing the studies. But [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=3996.62s)]
*  he also gave them one of his fundees, Ralph Barak from the University of North Carolina, [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4005.2599999999998s)]
*  developed a technique called the seamless ligation technique, which is a technique [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4012.14s)]
*  for hiding the laboratory origins of a, of a virus, of a manipulated virus. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4019.42s)]
*  So that normally if there's a virus manipulated, you can look at it, you know, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4026.8599999999997s)]
*  sought research, just going to look at it. They can look at the DNA sequences [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4032.14s)]
*  and they can say this thing was created in a lab. But Ralph Barak had developed a technique that he [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4036.7s)]
*  called the no seum technique and its technical name was seamless ligation. And it was a way of [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4043.5s)]
*  hiding evidence of human tampering. What is the public health rationale? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4050.86s)]
*  You would, if you were interested in public health, you would want to be doing the inverse [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4059.1s)]
*  of that. You would want to be pinning red flags all to it and say this was created by people. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4062.86s)]
*  That's what you would do if you're creating viruses for biological warfare. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4068.78s)]
*  Right. That's right. And, but, and that's another question is why would he give it to the Chinese? [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4072.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, that was a military lab was run by the military. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4077.8199999999997s)]
*  It's hard to even understand that. What do you, what would be the rationale for doing that? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4082.7799999999997s)]
*  I, you know, I, I try not to look in other people's heads. I try like in the Fauci book, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4089.98s)]
*  I never look in and speculate about what his motives are. I just say this, what he did. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4097.18s)]
*  But I do think that there's, as among a lot of the people who were doing that kind of research, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4102.14s)]
*  the gain of function research, their big career economic and professional incentives to [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4109.5s)]
*  break ground, to break new ground and say, you know, I just, one of his, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4118.46s)]
*  um, one of his fundees created a avian flu virus, which can be very deadly to humans. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4124.78s)]
*  If you can make it do human to human transition, um, our transmission and he developed one that [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4131.74s)]
*  could jump to mammals. Why would you do that? You know, you're just, you're inviting a catastrophe [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4141.42s)]
*  and they publish it and bragged about it. And I think there's this kind of, um, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4147.82s)]
*  this kind of, I don't know whether I would call it a God complex or something where, you know, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4155.34s)]
*  some of the people in that field seem to have, um, this, uh, this kind of gets some kind of sense [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4161.18s)]
*  of omnipotence or something from, you know, developing something that can kill all of humanity. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4169.74s)]
*  Yes. But I don't know. That's that is sheer speculation. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4174.78s)]
*  That sounds right to me. Um, so it sounds like Fauci is beyond the reach of the law at this point. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4179.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. There, I think generally unless there was a truth commission, you know, which they did in, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4187.58s)]
*  as you know, in South Africa, they did it in central America after the, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4196.7s)]
*  you know, the 1980s wars there and they were very, very helpful to those societies. And, you know, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4200.86s)]
*  I think we should probably do something like that now. And in those cases, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4208.7s)]
*  what happens is you have a commission that hears testimony on what exactly happened. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4214.46s)]
*  Anybody who comes and volunteers to testify truthfully is then given immunity from [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4219.0199999999995s)]
*  prosecution. And, but so that at least the public knows who did what. Yes. And people who are called [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4226.7s)]
*  and don't take that deal and purge themselves, they then can be, uh, they can be prosecuted [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4236.0599999999995s)]
*  criminally. We don't have a good track record of, um, revealing the truth in a timely manner. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4244.94s)]
*  Uh, as you know, better than anybody, the president on January 23rd issued an executive order ordering [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4251.9800000000005s)]
*  the full declassification of files related to the murder of your uncle, father, and Martin Luther King. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4258.14s)]
*  And, um, you know, we haven't seen all of them yet. Where is that process? Have your conclusions about [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4264.620000000001s)]
*  any or all of those three murders changed on the basis of new documents? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4273.740000000001s)]
*  No, nothing changed. I mean, you know, as you know, there's already millions of pages of [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4278.06s)]
*  documents out there. And I think, you know, in, um, in terms of my, um, my uncle's death, I think that, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4282.86s)]
*  uh, you know, that that ship has sailed. I don't think anybody who actually is willing to read the [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4295.98s)]
*  evidence now will question the fact that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy and that, um, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4302.7s)]
*  in fact, Congress in 1973, when the church committee looked at it, I think it was 73, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4311.98s)]
*  the church, 75, the church committee, they said it was conspiracy. That was the conclusion of [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4317.26s)]
*  the congressional committee. So the horn committee that was, uh, run by Alan Dallas, who was, you know, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4324.22s)]
*  uh, had a lot of reasons to lie and did lie throughout. And in fact, he said at one of the [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4331.58s)]
*  sessions, yeah, if we were involved in this, we would lie. Oh, he said that. Um, and he, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4338.78s)]
*  and he got himself put on that committee and he was really, it should have been called the Dulles [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4346.0599999999995s)]
*  commission. Oh, you know, he said it's a single shooter. Um, but, um, but then, you know, in 75, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4350.46s)]
*  that was 64. So 11 years later, Congress investigated and they had a much larger [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4359.66s)]
*  purview. They had much more data at that time. And they said it was a conspiracy. And, but since then [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4367.34s)]
*  there's been million documents released and, and probably 30 people who were involved in [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4373.9s)]
*  made confessions, including many of the prime actors. And so I don't think there is any doubt [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4379.5s)]
*  that my uncle was killed by a conspiracy. My father is, um, is, uh, more difficult because [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4388.7s)]
*  we just don't have the data. It's never been investigated. And, you know, I've been trying [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4395.58s)]
*  to get an investigator, you know, one of the women who played potentially a key role in it was a [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4400.38s)]
*  woman called a woman in the polka dot dress who was, who was, who appeared to be Sir Hans Handler. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4408.3s)]
*  And that woman is living openly in Tarzana, California. Nobody's ever talked to her. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4418.3s)]
*  And, um, she, you know, people should, this should be investigated and people should talk to [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4426.22s)]
*  her and, you know, really, uh, investigate the crime. Um, so, um, and as you know, and I think [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4433.18s)]
*  I've talked to you about this before and then my father, you know, Sir, and, um, was there. There [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4444.46s)]
*  were 77 eyewitnesses in the kitchen at the time. And he took two shots of my father. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4451.34s)]
*  And one of those shots hit Paul Schrade in the head and Paul Schrade survived. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4457.66s)]
*  And the other one hit the door jam behind my father and it was later removed by the LAPD. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4464.38s)]
*  And then Sir Hand was grabbed by six people, including Rayford Johnson, Rosie Greer, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4472.22s)]
*  Carl Ulrich, who is the, um, the, uh, uh, the manager of the ambassador hotel. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4478.3s)]
*  And they, they turned his gun, they bent him over the steam table and they turned his gun [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4485.5s)]
*  away from my father and it had six more shots in it. And he emptied the chamber. So they, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4490.78s)]
*  Sir Hand or Rayford told me that Sir Hand had superhuman strength. Sir Hand is a little tiny [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4498.0599999999995s)]
*  guy, you know, and I've met him and, and talked to him and, but he's a very, he's kind of a frail, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4503.74s)]
*  I mean, he's real now cause he's older, but even then he was just a little tiny guy, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4511.66s)]
*  you know, and was not particularly strong. And Rayford said he had superhuman strength and he [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4516.78s)]
*  could not pry the gun from his hand and he fired six more shots. All those shots hit people. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4522.86s)]
*  We know what happened every, every shot in his gun. And my father was shot by four shots from behind. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4527.74s)]
*  One of them passed harmlessly through the shoulder pad of his, this was Noguchi's autopsy said, [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4537.42s)]
*  through the shoulder pad of his suit. And all the others were contact shots, meaning the barrel of [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4544.46s)]
*  the gun was either touching his body or less than three inches from his body. The last shot that [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4551.5s)]
*  killed him was behind his left ear. And that shot he Noguchi says was from one to three inches from [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4558.3s)]
*  him. And Sir Hand was never behind him. Sir Hand was always in front of him. And they, a guy who [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4565.82s)]
*  almost certainly took those shots was a security guard who had just gotten his job within a week [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4574.22s)]
*  before. And he was, he was a, my father fell down on him. My father must've known that he was being [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4581.5s)]
*  shot because the last thing he did was he turned and he tore off the clip on tie from Caesar. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4590.3s)]
*  Caesar had him by the left hand and had steered him into the ambush. And he had his right hand, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4597.98s)]
*  he had his right hand, his gun in his right hand. And he admitted it. He was seen, you know, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4604.94s)]
*  my father fell on him and he pushed my father off of me, he was gun drawn. And he was, the gun was [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4612.78s)]
*  not taken away from him by the LAPD. He was in a terrible job. And, you know, not only a terrible, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4620.7s)]
*  but a malevolent job because they destroyed 2,500 photographs that were taken that night before the [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4626.299999999999s)]
*  trial. So there were photographs, you know, 2,500 photographs in that kitchen and the, and the [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4632.62s)]
*  ballroom. And the LAPD collected them and destroyed them all. And you have to ask why would they do [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4638.94s)]
*  that? And a lot of the other evidence was also destroyed, including the door jams and, you know, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4646.46s)]
*  we have pictures of them, but we, we don't have the real thing. And then they never confiscated the [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4652.7s)]
*  gun from, from, um, and Cesar said, and Cesar said that, Oh, I had the gun out because I was going [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4659.1s)]
*  to shoot at Sirhan. And so, you know, that should be questioned. Um, he was- [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4667.660000000001s)]
*  Are there any documents- [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4675.26s)]
*  I'll just say this, that Ayn Cesar was working at that time. His, his job was working for, um, [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4676.620000000001s)]
*  Lockheed plant in Los Angeles. And he had a top security classification at that. And [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4685.900000000001s)]
*  Lisa Pease, who's one of the researchers and authors who's written extensively about this, [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4695.9800000000005s)]
*  went through, you know, um, his background and the only employer that he ever listed [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4700.46s)]
*  officially in his background was the CIA. So there are a lot of questions and we don't know [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4707.9s)]
*  the answers to them. You know, I was in contact with Cesar in 2019, 2020 negotiating with him. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4715.179999999999s)]
*  He had moved to the Philippines and I was trying to see if he would talk to me. I was going to go [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4724.219999999999s)]
*  over there and talk to him and he said, I'll do it for $5,000. And then when I got closed, he said, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4729.98s)]
*  $10,000. And he said, $20,000. And then he said, $30,000. And, uh, you know, and then he just said, [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4734.78s)]
*  I'm not going to meet with you. Oh, you know, he, and then he's since, he's since passed away. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4742.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you know, again, we don't know, but there are enough kind of flags on it that you would, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4749.9s)]
*  you know, that if you were actually wanted to know answers, you would be asking questions. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4755.179999999999s)]
*  And are you confident that I know there's been some frustration [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4759.74s)]
*  about getting all the documents relevant to those three murders, those three assassinations? [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4763.5s)]
*  Are you confident that all of it will come out by the end of this time? [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4767.66s)]
*  I'm confident that President Trump will release anything that he has access to. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4770.3s)]
*  But, you know, I don't expect anything groundbreaking to come from those documents [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4777.099999999999s)]
*  because first of all, with my uncle, we've already got everything. There may be little things like, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4781.82s)]
*  uh, you know, the calendar for, uh, for Bill Harvey, who was one of the people was in the CIA, [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4787.0199999999995s)]
*  who is almost certainly involved and, uh, and other things like that that would be, [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4794.0599999999995s)]
*  and then more evidence. I mean, you know, the evidence that came out the last tranche [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4800.54s)]
*  and New York times had to finally admit that, that certainly that [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4807.34s)]
*  Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA asset, which they'd been denying for 50 years. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4811.18s)]
*  They finally admitted, yeah, he was working for the CIA. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4818.38s)]
*  And so, uh, you know, there may be some more validation of, of what, you know, he was doing [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4823.02s)]
*  and how he was recruited, et cetera. Um, but I don't think it's going to be anything groundbreaking. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4829.58s)]
*  I don't think you need anything groundbreaking. I think, listen, I was a prosecutor. If I had [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4835.34s)]
*  tried the case right now, you know, uh, I guess a number of the people are dead. I believe I can [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4840.54s)]
*  win and from a jury with it, just with the evidence that we got, with my dad, um, you know, [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4846.3s)]
*  it was never investigated and that was deliberate. So last question you left what you were born here. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4853.42s)]
*  Obviously your father's attorney general, uh, the United States when you were young, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4859.58s)]
*  he's murdered 1968. You leave Washington. You haven't lived here since you just came back as [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4863.58s)]
*  secretary. What's it like? What do you notice? What do you think of it? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4868.3s)]
*  Well, you know, I didn't expect to love living in Washington. I, when I was a kid, I couldn't wait [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4873.74s)]
*  to get out of Washington. Um, but you know, I'm, my, my wife is happy here. We found kind of a [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4878.860000000001s)]
*  community and a neighborhood and, um, the, I love the people that I'm working with at this agency. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4887.66s)]
*  It's the most gifted, committed group of people that I've ever worked with and they're, you know, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4895.74s)]
*  immensely talented and committed. And then I really liked the cabin. I think that the, you know, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4900.78s)]
*  president Trump's cabinet has put together an extraordinary cabinet. Um, uh, I'm, I'm friends [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4908.78s)]
*  with a number of the people who I never thought I'd be friends with, but they're, you know, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4915.42s)]
*  how do you like, I mean, I really, I really get along with Pam Bondi and, and you know, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4920.0599999999995s)]
*  Cheryl loves Pam and her husband, John. And then I really, and Marco Rubio, Marco Rubio is the [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4928.0599999999995s)]
*  funniest guy in the cabinet. He, he says things that make people belly laugh at every cabinet [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4936.78s)]
*  meeting. And he's, uh, you know, I, I, I always, I never was very, let's say approving of, of Marco [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4943.74s)]
*  because he was kind of a neotanwar hawk, but now he's had this incredible transformation. And, uh, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4953.58s)]
*  you know, I think he, um, you know, I think he very aligned with me on most issues on Ukraine, [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4961.26s)]
*  you know, and just the fact that we should not be the policeman of the world anymore. That we've [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4968.7s)]
*  got to, that, you know, we've got to withdraw from that, um, from that role. But I get, I really, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4973.9s)]
*  I, you know, Scott Turner's my friend, uh, Sean, uh, you know, and, uh, all of them, I get at Lynn, [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4982.3s)]
*  Linda McMahon. I get along, you know, one of the things with [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4991.34s)]
*  President Trump is that he really knows how to pick talent. And he, um, and I'm not talking [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=4995.26s)]
*  about me, I'm, I'm, but the other people on there, when you sit in those cabinet meetings, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5002.14s)]
*  and every one of those people is incredibly erudite and just fluid in the way that they speak and [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5008.06s)]
*  very, very comfortable. And they're one of the things that President Trump did when he [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5014.860000000001s)]
*  picked the cabinet. And I was on the transition team. So I watched what he was doing [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5021.34s)]
*  for every, uh, of one of the positions that he picked, he wanted to see three clips of them [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5026.78s)]
*  performing on TV. And so, you know, he's very conscious of the way of, of that these people [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5033.34s)]
*  are going to be out selling his program to the public and that he needs people who are, you know, [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5041.66s)]
*  good salespeople, not only good administrators, but that they're, that they can communicate a [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5048.14s)]
*  message to the public. And I think this time around is, you know, everybody tells me it's [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5054.54s)]
*  completely different than the last administration because he, he's, you know, he had so much time [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5061.820000000001s)]
*  to grow and to learn and to figure out how to do this right. And, uh, you know, we need a revolution [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5069.42s)]
*  in this country. We've got, you know, we've got a $34 trillion debt. We've got more, we're spending [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5076.62s)]
*  2 trillion more a year than we got. We're borrowing it from China and from Saudi Arabia and Japan. We [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5083.18s)]
*  have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit. And, you know, a lot of people are, uh, businesses are hurting [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5090.7s)]
*  because of the tariffs, but over the, I, you know, I admire President Trump because he is looking [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5098.0599999999995s)]
*  over the horizon and he's looking at, you know, we, this is unsustainable. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5102.86s)]
*  And we need to do something radically different. And, um, you know, you need to, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5108.86s)]
*  particularly at the beginning, when you have momentum and when you have your most power, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5115.099999999999s)]
*  you need to do a lot of things that are going to be very, very disruptive to many, many people. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5118.94s)]
*  He still has tremendous support for the American public. And I feel it every day. I walk down a [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5126.54s)]
*  block and, you know, people are ecstatic. They, you know, come to me and say, thank you for what [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5131.74s)]
*  you're doing. And they feel good about this country again. You know, I'll just tell you another [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5138.38s)]
*  anecdote. If we have, if we have time, my, my uncle Ted Kennedy really didn't personally, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5143.66s)]
*  did not like Jimmy Carter. He, but every level, famously, he didn't like his politics. He didn't [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5152.139999999999s)]
*  like him personally. And, you know, Carter did a lot of things that my uncle was just, I mean, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5158.78s)]
*  one of them was he banned liquor from the white house, which my uncle didn't like. And then he, [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5164.7s)]
*  and he put, you know, the, what was it, Fresco or something on tap at the white house. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5170.46s)]
*  And, uh, so there were just little things like that, that annoyed him, but he also, [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5176.0599999999995s)]
*  well, when Carter came in, he talked about the malaise in this country and how bad everything was. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5182.62s)]
*  And, um, and it's like what Starmerton in England, you know, to tell and, and that [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5187.66s)]
*  people take those messages from their command, from their leader. And, um, and my uncle, and then [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5195.0199999999995s)]
*  Reagan came in and Reagan was dismantling everything Teddy had done over, you know, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5202.86s)]
*  40 year career. But Teddy really liked them. And I asked him one time, wow, you know, this guy is [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5208.78s)]
*  destroying everything you believe in. And Teddy said, I like them because he makes people feel [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5216.3s)]
*  good about being American. And he is able to inspire hope for the country again. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5222.06s)]
*  And, you know, president Trump does that, whatever you think about him, there are, [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5229.18s)]
*  there's a new feeling in America now that, you know, we're, we're back on the upswing again, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5235.58s)]
*  you know, as he says, the country is hot again, you know, and all around the world, people see [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5242.14s)]
*  that too. And, you know, a lot of things have surprised me about the president because I, [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5247.26s)]
*  you know, bought into this fact that he was this one dimensional character, that he was kind of a [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5253.66s)]
*  bombastic narcissist and all this, you know, and part of it is hearing it all the time on TV, but [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5259.82s)]
*  also, you know, the way that he conducts himself sometimes validates those, if you have that [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5265.82s)]
*  narrative, you can find things when he does it validate that. But what I've been surprised [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5274.299999999999s)]
*  in getting to know him is what a kind of deep multi-dimensional and thoughtful character he is [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5280.62s)]
*  and how well I also thought, oh, he doesn't read and, you know, he's not interested in anything. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5285.98s)]
*  He's immensely curious, inquisitive and immensely knowledgeable. He's encyclopedic in certain areas [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5291.34s)]
*  that you wouldn't expect like music. And, you know, he gets very emotional about music. And he has, [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5300.14s)]
*  and he knows the whole story behind every song. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5306.78s)]
*  Pavarotti and James Brown. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5309.26s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. And he cries when he hears Pavarotti. He said to me one night when we were at Marta [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5310.54s)]
*  Lago with the Amaryllis, he said, he said, Amaryllis, you understand this because she loves [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5316.86s)]
*  music too. And he said, but most of the people here, they don't understand it. They don't get it. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5322.139999999999s)]
*  And then in terms of sports, he is, he just, he's an encyclopedia. He knows everything. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5327.179999999999s)]
*  And then, you know, on wall street, he knows how everybody made their money and, and the stories [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5337.259999999999s)]
*  and is, you know, an incredible raconteur about telling all these stories. And then, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5343.98s)]
*  and also the most surprising thing is because I had him pegged as a narcissist, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5349.98s)]
*  but narcissists are incapable of empathy. And he's one of the most empathetic people that I've met. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5356.0599999999995s)]
*  You notice whenever he talks about the Ukraine war, he always talks about the casualties on both [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5363.0199999999995s)]
*  sides. Every time he talks about it, I noticed that. And he does that in every theater. He [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5369.66s)]
*  talks about how human beings are affected. And, you know, whether it's vaccines or Medicaid or [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5375.5s)]
*  Medicare, he's always thinking about how this impacts the little guy. And, you know, the [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5382.3s)]
*  Democrats haven't pegged as a guy who's sort of sitting, you know, in the cabinet meeting, [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5391.26s)]
*  talking about how can we make billionaires richer. He's the opposite of that. He's a [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5395.98s)]
*  genuine populist. And, you know, like all of us were all flawed characters in one way or another, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5401.74s)]
*  but I think he's really a uniquely right person for this country right now, because we were in [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5409.259999999999s)]
*  a death spiral and not only just, you know, morale, but also just, you know, the deficits are, [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5417.74s)]
*  you know, who could ever, would you believe we'd ever have a president in our lifetime who would [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5426.54s)]
*  actually be addressing, you know, the costs of government in a dramatic way? And the trade [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5431.42s)]
*  deficits, how could you ever cure that? It's too entrenched in so many people, you know, making [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5438.219999999999s)]
*  money on them. But meanwhile, all of us all going to hell in a handbasket. And, you know, so [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5443.82s)]
*  I think he's doing stuff, a great political cause to him that is going to benefit this country 10 [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5451.74s)]
*  years from now and 20 years from now. And, you know, I'm really proud to be part of it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5456.78s)]
*  Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Thank you very much. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5461.98s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5464.7s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising, [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5465.5s)]
*  that's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5474.78s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5478.54s)]
*  one the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5483.58s)]
*  rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5488.86s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5495.1s)]
*  could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5498.860000000001s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5503.26s)]
*  channel. Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5508.3s)]
*  That way, you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5513.900000000001s)]
*  hope that you'll do that. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fzlwxJZAA&t=5519.26s)]
