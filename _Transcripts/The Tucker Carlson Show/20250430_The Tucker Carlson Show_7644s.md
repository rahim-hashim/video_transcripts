# Matt Walsh: Any country that can’t function without American aid has no right to exist.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE)
*  Okay, so I'm gonna um, I'm not an ex all that much but I do read you and sometimes I read [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=0.0s)]
*  Your tweets and I'm like Matt Walsh ladies and gentlemen spinning people up. Here's one [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7.04s)]
*  We've been saying for many years the gay adoption surrogacy should be illegal now [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Everyone else seems to be catching on this is an abomination [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=16.82s)]
*  We've been saying for many years that gay adoptions an abomination. I've never heard anybody say that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=20.96s)]
*  Wow, we're just diving right in we're diving right in day adoption is an abomination [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=26.8s)]
*  Yeah, well I think there I was referring to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Social conservatives because social conservatives still somehow get a bad rap, so, you know so-called social conservatives [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=54.0s)]
*  even among other [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Conservatives and other people on the right it seems to me [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=64.48s)]
*  but [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=68.0s)]
*  So when I say we I mean like so-called social conservative never heard them say that I've never heard anybody [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=69.04s)]
*  I think I agree with it what you said [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=74.2s)]
*  But I'm not I don't think I've ever heard a single person say that everyone seems to be afraid to say that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=77.2s)]
*  Yeah, most people are that's why I think but but you know so-called social conservatism is is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=82.92s)]
*  That's why it's not [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=89.08s)]
*  popular even even on the right [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=91.12s)]
*  Can I see what is there anything more hated on the right than social conservatism? I [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  Don't think so [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=98.84s)]
*  So you could say like I think we should drop an atomic bomb and a bunch of people just like kill them all and their [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=99.64s)]
*  Kids and people like well, that's a really good idea [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=104.56s)]
*  But if you're like actually we should like save some kids then they hate you. What is that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=106.4s)]
*  Yeah, or if we should we should [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=110.82s)]
*  We should probably we should look at the way that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=113.61999999999999s)]
*  human society was structured for thousands of years and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=117.7s)]
*  We should probably consider that they were right about a lot of that stuff, you know, maybe not everything right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=122.62s)]
*  Maybe not everything but there are just certain basic civilizational truths that we have moved away from in recent decades [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=129.1s)]
*  But I don't think there was any good reason to move away from them [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=138.06s)]
*  and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=140.78s)]
*  So if if human beings did something a certain way for literally millennia in every civilization that we know of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=141.98s)]
*  It's it's probably right. I mean, there's probably it's there's probably a lot to be said for it again [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=151.34s)]
*  Not in every case, but in in most cases so it's worth pondering [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=156.6s)]
*  Anyway, it tells you something if right if every civilization none of which that we know have had contact with each other came [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=159.88s)]
*  to the same conclusions [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=166.62s)]
*  Exactly so it's something like the you know gay adoption [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=168.38s)]
*  That and this is this isn't the only argument against it, but I think it is a worthwhile argument that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=172.98s)]
*  There's never been a society anywhere on earth anywhere period where they have had [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=178.62s)]
*  Two men in a romantic relationship [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=184.7s)]
*  Starting a family that's just that's never existed [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=187.36s)]
*  it's always been a man and woman start a family or [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=190.42000000000002s)]
*  In certain ancient civilizations and even some primitive ones today, you might have a man and several women you might have polygamy. Mm-hmm [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=194.48s)]
*  That's but that's pretty common feature [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=201.84s)]
*  I would say it's certainly common, but you never had and why do you have polygamy? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=203.68s)]
*  I'm not I don't support polygamy, but there was a logic to it especially in ancient times [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=207.66s)]
*  Yes, you got to create people, you know [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=211.01999999999998s)]
*  And the whole point is to create the whole point of the family is to make children and care for them [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=213.0s)]
*  and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=218.76s)]
*  You know a family that's headed up by two gay men is [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=220.44s)]
*  That's why it's it's a it's an abomination. It's just never happened before and now it's happening and that's why we call it progress [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=226.32s)]
*  Right. This is progress. It's something that was never been done. Yeah, and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=232.62s)]
*  Well, it's progress in the way [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=237.48s)]
*  It's progress in the way that cancer progresses, you know, so when I hear about progressivism, I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=240.48s)]
*  Think of I think of progressivism it is progress. So we're at stage four gay right now, would you say oh, yeah [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=246.64s)]
*  Stayed full on stage four. Yeah [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=253.12s)]
*  Terminal it's a it's a terminal case. Yeah [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=256.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'd fear why I just jump right into it so um [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=260.76s)]
*  But what is so I think you make it obvious and very fair and smart point [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=264.0s)]
*  We should pay attention to the way things have always been done because maybe we can learn something. It's like discarding it all [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=269.0s)]
*  French Revolution style doesn't end well, I totally agree [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=273.96s)]
*  But what's the the more affirmative detailed case against it? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=277.0s)]
*  These kids don't have homes and here are two loving parents to watch over the child. Why is that bad? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=281.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think that there are a couple things first of all [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=287.88s)]
*  It's it's interesting to note that when this conversation about gay parenthood first started really in earnest like ten years ago [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=291.8s)]
*  Most of the conversation was focused on adoption and right gay men want to adopt [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=299.08s)]
*  But now what's happened is there's been a shift and now you've got a lot of these gay couples that are turning to surrogacy [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=304.52s)]
*  So they're renting wounds, you know, they're renting the the they're purchasing the body parts of women and renting them using them like an Airbnb [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=310.8s)]
*  rental [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=319.08s)]
*  Well, I thought we get rid of slavery [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=320.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I would have thought but this is this is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=322.44s)]
*  Exactly, this is the in a very literal sense the objectification of a human being treating them like an object using them as an object [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=325.96s)]
*  So it's just interesting there was a study done research a survey a couple years ago actually [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=332.52s)]
*  That found that it was like 60 plus percent of gay couples [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=336.88s)]
*  When they think about parenting they would prefer surrogacy [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=342.28s)]
*  So it's a slight a hand trick you see on the left a lot [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  Where they they want to bring about some social change and they they present an argument for it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=349.32s)]
*  But then once they get what they want they abandon that and then you kind of you figure out what they actually wanted [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=354.0s)]
*  So it's kind of like adoption has given way [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=360.20000000000005s)]
*  To surrogacy and then the whole argument which I didn't I never bought which is that we're rescuing kids who are in these terrible [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=363.76s)]
*  Situations and foster care that's out the window because these are not kids that you're rescuing [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=370.72s)]
*  You're creating them rather than rescuing a kid from an unfortunate situation [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=375.24s)]
*  You're creating them to be in an unfortunate situation from birth [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  Which is a which is a different thing. So that's the first thing and the second thing is that even if we're talking would you concede that? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=385.28000000000003s)]
*  One upside to a collapsing post-industrial economy is there a ton of poor people who are willing to have babies for profit? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=392.84000000000003s)]
*  Another that I would call that an upside [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=401.56s)]
*  Just like this is so like [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=403.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's people don't take three steps back [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=405.56s)]
*  Like if this were happening and if you know Dickens were writing about this in the 1850s, you'd be like, wow [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=407.72s)]
*  You know London's a very screwed up place [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=413.0s)]
*  Yeah, where we're taking advantage of the poor like that's the step beyond prostitution [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=415.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean it really is treating someone as you said correctly as an object, but there's not but there's also [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=421.08s)]
*  the fundamental point whether it's surrogacy or adoption [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=426.28s)]
*  the fundamental point is [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=430.36s)]
*  What does the child have a right to we keep hearing about right we hear about? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=434.52s)]
*  This right to parenthood. I mean you have gay couples now that are that are demanding [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=440.12s)]
*  Insurance cover fertility treatments as if the reason why two men can't make a baby is because of fertility problems [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=444.92s)]
*  No, it's because of the laws of nature [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=451.8s)]
*  but [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=453.8s)]
*  And that is that is cloaked under this it's sort of under this umbrella of why I have a right to parenthood [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=454.76s)]
*  Right to parenthood [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=460.20000000000005s)]
*  No, you don't have a right to what does that mean? No one has a right to be a parent [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  Uh, it's great to be a parent if you can but you're not born with those like entitlements. You're entitled to a child [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=465.56s)]
*  What the hell does that mean? [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=472.04s)]
*  Rather than talking about the right of the parent [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=473.72s)]
*  Let's talk about the right of the child and this also this applies to so many of it this applies to abortion supplies to a lot [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=475.8s)]
*  of topics [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=480.6s)]
*  um, what does the child have a right to and I would say a child has a right [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=481.72s)]
*  To a mother and a father a child has a right to the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=487.08s)]
*  Basic fundamental [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=491.24s)]
*  Setup that that you know billions of kids throughout history have had [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=494.6s)]
*  Which is a mother and a father now if through the course of events [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=500.2s)]
*  Through no one's fault [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=504.76s)]
*  That is taken away from a child. I mean you can have a parent that dies you end up with a single parent [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=507.48s)]
*  You can have a divorce which I think is terrible [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=511.32s)]
*  um [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=514.28s)]
*  But it's not supposed to work that way [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=515.32s)]
*  So if you have a child in foster care [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=518.5200000000001s)]
*  You're looking for a mother and a father and to just say okay. Well, we'll give this child to two dads [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=521.72s)]
*  You're basically giving up on that child. You're saying well, yeah, we couldn't find the right setup for you [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=527.32s)]
*  So instead you're getting this [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=531.6400000000001s)]
*  And I just reject that I reject that totally [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=533.32s)]
*  um [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=536.6800000000001s)]
*  And I also think frankly that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=538.6s)]
*  You know [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=541.72s)]
*  A lot of people won't like this but but but I I think we've passed the point world. Yeah, right [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=543.32s)]
*  No one likes anything that we're saying [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=547.5600000000001s)]
*  A child being in foster care is is far from an ideal scenario. It's very very sad [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=550.12s)]
*  uh a child [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=556.52s)]
*  Going to two gay parents [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=558.28s)]
*  I think is worse. I think it's I think it's easily worse actually why? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=560.28s)]
*  um [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=564.52s)]
*  It's just more disordered. It's more confusing for the child [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  um [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=569.08s)]
*  Again, neither neither scenario was good. We don't like either thing [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=570.36s)]
*  but um [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=574.04s)]
*  I I don't see going to [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=576.36s)]
*  You know gay parents as an improvement over the the what they had before [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=580.04s)]
*  So do we know that it screws kids up or we just sort of intuitively know it? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=585.64s)]
*  I think we intuitively know but also there's been plenty of studies done about [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=590.36s)]
*  um [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=594.36s)]
*  The mental health effects of kids that grow up in these, you know, single sex [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=595.72s)]
*  Same-sex parent homes. There's been a lot of studies done about it. But but honestly, I don't [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=601.0s)]
*  You can look at the studies people will fact check and they're there [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=605.88s)]
*  I just I don't need studies for this. It's it's the same thing with the trans topic, you know [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=610.0400000000001s)]
*  From the very beginning when we started talking about that you had all these people saying well, where are the studies? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=617.96s)]
*  Where are the studies showing that we shouldn't chemically castrate a five-year-old or you know, or a 12 year old [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=623.24s)]
*  Well, there are studies now [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=631.0s)]
*  That will bear that out [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=633.24s)]
*  But I didn't we don't need a study to tell us that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=635.32s)]
*  This should be this should be intuitive. We just intuitively know it there are certain things as human beings that we just know [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=639.0s)]
*  and one of them is that [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=647.4000000000001s)]
*  Sexually mutilating a child is bad [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=649.72s)]
*  Another one is that a child needs a mother and father. We just intuitively know that [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=652.36s)]
*  I don't need any study. I don't care what any academic says about it. I don't care [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=656.76s)]
*  So when you were born the aids the aids crisis aids was um sort of in its early years [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  And there were famous people who had aids who died of aids who lied about [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=669.24s)]
*  Why they were dying because they don't want to admit that they were gay. So that was the world you were born into [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=673.4s)]
*  Um now being gay is like an advantage in college admissions in a lot of schools and [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=679.32s)]
*  In hiring so like we it's moved completely. It's like the opposite of what it was in 40 years [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=685.8000000000001s)]
*  Why do you think that happened? [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=692.36s)]
*  And what do you think its effects are? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=694.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's um [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  It's the collapse of well, it's just this war on it's kind of what we started with it's this war on normalcy on [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=707.24s)]
*  Civilization really it's part of the anti-family agenda [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=714.98s)]
*  The anti-human agenda [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=720.12s)]
*  Uh, and I think that and that's that's always been there [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=723.4s)]
*  Why did it catch on though to such an extent? [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=727.16s)]
*  I think that the the side that was supposed to stand up for [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=730.36s)]
*  For the family and stand up for civilization [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=734.6s)]
*  Largely failed and abdicated their responsibility to do so [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=739.08s)]
*  You know conservatives the church [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=743.32s)]
*  Uh has just largely failed [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=746.44s)]
*  And not even failed not even tried really [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=749.72s)]
*  Not not even tried. Why is that? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=752.36s)]
*  Fear cowardice [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=756.12s)]
*  um [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=758.36s)]
*  Uh [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=761.8800000000001s)]
*  Hypocrisy [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=763.32s)]
*  I mean, I mean hypocrisy in the in the actual sense in the literal sense of not someone who's you know [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=764.7600000000001s)]
*  Says something it does another but someone who claims to believe something they don't which is what actual hypocrisy is [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=769.6400000000001s)]
*  um [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=774.84s)]
*  And so we have a lot of hypocrites on the right and in the church unfortunately [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=776.12s)]
*  Who are just claiming to believe things they don't really believe and so I think that the answer is it's like why why don't [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=780.84s)]
*  Why why aren't there enough pastors in any church in any denomination? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=788.12s)]
*  Standing up and talking about these issues and leading, you know leading on these issues [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=791.8199999999999s)]
*  And uh, the answer is well, there's a lot of cowards, but also a certain portion of them don't really [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=797.0999999999999s)]
*  Believe it. I mean they don't believe [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=802.9399999999999s)]
*  It's like whether or not they really believe in god is a question. So [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=806.06s)]
*  I think that that's a that's a part of it, too. What do you think the fact of it has been? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=810.06s)]
*  Not not just the acceptance of homosexuality but the celebration of it like what? [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=816.2199999999999s)]
*  I remember hearing, you know 30 years ago [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=821.5s)]
*  When this was gathering steam people saying well, well, it's not a threat to you [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=824.62s)]
*  You know gays aren't going to break into your house and you know, force forcibly make you gay or something. Like why do you care? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  And I thought that you know, it kind of made sense to me at the time. Um, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=835.02s)]
*  but I [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=839.7399999999999s)]
*  There's a sense that's just not true actually that it did have a big effect on everybody else. Do you think that? [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=841.8199999999999s)]
*  it certainly did because [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=848.62s)]
*  It's always a lie. Obviously when they say oh this isn't we just want to do what we want to do [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=851.5799999999999s)]
*  And we're not it doesn't won't affect you and we we don't need you to be involved [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=856.14s)]
*  um [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=861.0999999999999s)]
*  This is just what we're doing in the privacy of our own homes [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=863.42s)]
*  That was a good argument though. Don't you think it in in theory in principle? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=866.8599999999999s)]
*  It's i'm just saying as a as a kind of matter of slogans, you know, like [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=870.9399999999999s)]
*  That's better than just do it for nike or have a coconut smile. That's like a really [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=875.26s)]
*  effective ad campaign for americans because that matches the american instinct like [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=880.04s)]
*  You know, and there's and there's a certain it it makes sense to an extent [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=886.06s)]
*  That [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=892.46s)]
*  If someone across the street from me is in their home doing some freaky weird stuff [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=894.14s)]
*  And that's it. They're just in their home doing it and I never even know about it or see it [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=899.66s)]
*  My children don't see it. My children don't know about it [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=903.5s)]
*  Uh [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=906.4599999999999s)]
*  Then yeah, it's hard to make an argument that i'm somehow impacted by that [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=907.5s)]
*  Because i'm not except maybe in the most indirect sort of way [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=911.02s)]
*  But that's not that's not how it actually works. That's just the slogan [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=915.1s)]
*  That's not what really happens. And so we follow the trajectory [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=918.22s)]
*  And we've seen this time and time again [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=922.14s)]
*  it always starts with [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=924.4599999999999s)]
*  Tolerance they say well just just tolerate this [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=927.24s)]
*  Which which is which I guess we're supposed to think means [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=931.5799999999999s)]
*  You know just [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=935.4200000000001s)]
*  People are doing this on their own. You don't have to you could just stay out of it [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=937.6600000000001s)]
*  And they'll stay away from you and yes tolerate it, right? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=940.94s)]
*  Tolerance so it starts there [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=945.24s)]
*  But then it goes to very quickly [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=948.46s)]
*  Acceptance then they start saying well, you should accept this well accept and tolerate or [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=951.32s)]
*  Not exactly the same thing [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=956.7s)]
*  How are they different? Well tolerate means I just like put up with it. I allow it I allow it [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=958.38s)]
*  I put up with it. I don't try to stop it. Right is what tolerance means in the most literal sense [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=962.94s)]
*  except means [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=969.1s)]
*  I'm embracing it, right? You know, it means i'm embracing it and [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=971.82s)]
*  But then they don't stop it accepting because then they go to well, okay now actually we need you to celebrate it [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=977.66s)]
*  You know, so it goes from tolerance to acceptance to celebration [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=982.78s)]
*  And um pretty fast actually pretty fast [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=987.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think I think there was a time when that process might have taken, you know 10 years and now it seems like it takes 10 minutes [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=990.4599999999999s)]
*  um [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=996.86s)]
*  So we we went from decades ago. It was hey, they're just in their private [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=997.8199999999999s)]
*  In their private lives in their own homes doing this [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1003.02s)]
*  Doesn't affect you [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1005.42s)]
*  To now well, they're I mean literally marching in the street [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1007.3399999999999s)]
*  You know in leather bondage gear [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1011.74s)]
*  Like flaunting in front of confused children standing there having sex on the street actually [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1014.3s)]
*  Yeah, right engage in sexual acts and [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1018.78s)]
*  even worse than that [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1022.14s)]
*  They're going into the school systems. They're putting this stuff in the school. They're [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1023.9s)]
*  They're trying to tell my kids when my kids aren't in the school system, but you know [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1027.74s)]
*  They're trying to tell our kids. Do the authorities know your kids aren't in the school system? Well, they do now [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1031.74s)]
*  We still i'm in tennessee. So we still have we still have that right in tennessee so far [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1038.06s)]
*  But then they start going into the school system. They start they start promoting this they start trying to tell our kids [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1041.98s)]
*  That's uh that you should also tolerate this and accept it and embrace it and and celebrate it [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1048.14s)]
*  um [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1054.78s)]
*  There's this kind of there's a [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1056.38s)]
*  You know what what they're telling kids in school about homosexuality, for example is not just biology [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1059.02s)]
*  There's a moral message. They're giving them a moral message and the moral message is [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1064.14s)]
*  This is okay. There's nothing wrong with it [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1068.46s)]
*  It's this is you know, a gay couple is equal in every way to a straight couple [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1070.14s)]
*  These are just different variations, you know, it's a it's morally neutral [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1075.18s)]
*  That's their message. That's a that's ideology. That's not biology and um [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1080.06s)]
*  And once you start doing that then it's like very clear how this affects me [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1085.1000000000001s)]
*  You know, but how does it affect the society? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1089.9s)]
*  well [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1093.18s)]
*  fundamentally transforms [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1094.22s)]
*  society and our basic [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1096.28s)]
*  Priorities how we live what matters to us? [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1099.16s)]
*  So we're not positive that cryptocurrency is the future of finance [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1102.38s)]
*  But we do know that what we have now is broken and dangerous debt has never been higher in this country [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1105.26s)]
*  Many of our so-called leaders are getting rich serving you it's a scam [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1110.7s)]
*  So where does it go? Well, thankfully there are options. Donald trump has said repeatedly [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1115.3400000000001s)]
*  He wants the united states to be the crypto capital of the world [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1119.74s)]
*  He's already created the crypto advisory council and recently signed an executive order to establish a bitcoin strategic reserve [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1122.6200000000001s)]
*  This could give normal people an alternative to the government's failing system and frankly to the u.s dollar [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1129.26s)]
*  I'm not saying put all your money outside the u.s dollar, but like don't be crazy. Don't be stupid here [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1134.94s)]
*  You can see where it's going. So the people at itrust capital can help you get in [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1139.34s)]
*  to this it's [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1143.98s)]
*  Complicated for people who aren't following it. They make it easy. They're based 100% in the united states of america [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1145.74s)]
*  We looked into this they service only american investors and they operate the only platform that allows you to buy and sell crypto [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1150.78s)]
*  24 7 both inside and outside of your tax advantaged ira and it all happens on one easy to use dashboard [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1157.82s)]
*  They also operate a closed loop system meaning that bad actors can't access your account and steal your money [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1164.46s)]
*  So if you're considering adding bitcoin if you want to or some other cryptocurrency [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1170.94s)]
*  Portfolio, I trust can be trusted and it's easy to understand [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1175.0s)]
*  I trust capital.com or click the link below it scrambles the gender roles. That's what I notice and that's what upsets me most [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1180.3s)]
*  Because I think everything is built on biology on nature and gender roles are a function of nature [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1187.82s)]
*  and I think if you scramble that if you confuse that if you [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1193.82s)]
*  Convince people that there's no difference between men and women like that's when civilization falls [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1197.34s)]
*  Then you have like women fighting your wars. Yeah, you know what I mean? That's and gender roles is another one [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1202.14s)]
*  uh [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1208.62s)]
*  That again it goes back to [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1210.22s)]
*  It's just human civilization worked a certain way for thousands of years and it seemed to work [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1212.6200000000001s)]
*  uh, and we went from you know mud huts to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1219.1000000000001s)]
*  walking on the moon [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1223.02s)]
*  If you believe we walked on the moon, which I absolutely do [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1224.8600000000001s)]
*  Uh, well you are taking some bold positions. Yeah, that is bold. That is bold. I know [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1227.74s)]
*  You're taking on the entire internet. We so we went we went from from there to there [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1232.46s)]
*  Uh with a kind of basic structure with a basic setup [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1237.58s)]
*  Gender roles is one of them. There's like this base [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1242.46s)]
*  They were they were so basic so fundamental that you didn't even you didn't have a word for it [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1245.1s)]
*  You know if you go back to 1700 and use the term gender roles [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1249.98s)]
*  To anyone they're not gonna have any idea what the hell you're talking about [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1254.46s)]
*  even though [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1257.74s)]
*  Their entire society is structured around it. Exactly and uh, and this is true even now if you go if you go outside of the kind of [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1258.94s)]
*  Liberal western bubble which i've done which i've done once when we were doing what is a woman I went to [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1266.14s)]
*  We went to Kenya and we talked to the messiah tribe [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1271.9s)]
*  In in Kenya, did they know what a woman was? They did know what a woman was [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1274.78s)]
*  They were confused by the question not because they didn't know the answer but because they couldn't possibly understand why it would even be asked, right? [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1280.3s)]
*  um [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1287.98s)]
*  But then I even I remember a lot of this didn't make it in the movie because it was it wasn't totally connected but [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1289.5800000000002s)]
*  Talking about gender roles with them and again, they had no idea what that term even meant [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1293.98s)]
*  But their whole society is completely structured around it. It was if you're a man, this is what you do [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1299.42s)]
*  If you're a woman, this is what you do [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1305.1000000000001s)]
*  and that's it and um [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1307.42s)]
*  And I remember asking one of the the women I was in there in her uh her hut [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1310.6200000000001s)]
*  Which is actually made of like cow dung and it's a one-room hut and they all sleep on one bed [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1314.94s)]
*  You know mud mud floor [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1319.9s)]
*  And she was telling me what she does all day as the woman of the house [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1322.38s)]
*  Which is she takes care of the house. She takes care of the kids [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1326.46s)]
*  and [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1329.98s)]
*  I asked her if she was happy doing this and she she laughed at me because it was such a ridiculous question because of course she is [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1332.38s)]
*  And then I asked about depression and this might be in the movie [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1340.22s)]
*  I said, you know where I come from. There's a lot of people are depressed [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1343.5800000000002s)]
*  And one of the guys said to me well, we don't have that here [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1347.26s)]
*  We don't we don't do that. We don't have we don't have depression. That's not a thing here [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1350.14s)]
*  um [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1353.9s)]
*  And that's not and you know [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1355.5s)]
*  Of course there's unhappiness. It's not like a utopia. I wouldn't want to live there to be perfectly [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1358.54s)]
*  clear about it [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1363.5s)]
*  but [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1365.18s)]
*  uh, you do notice that [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1366.46s)]
*  In these societies that are structured around gender roles [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1369.9s)]
*  There's just there's a lot of anxiety and hang-ups that they don't have because they know [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1372.54s)]
*  They have a basic concept of who they are and what they're supposed to do. Well, they're not at war with nature every day [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1378.14s)]
*  Right, you can't beat nature [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1384.38s)]
*  If I go out [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1386.94s)]
*  Into a blizzard with my boxer shorts, I don't care [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1388.78s)]
*  What you know my resolve level is or my courage [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1391.9s)]
*  It's like i'm gonna freeze to death because you can't beat nature because it's bigger than you because god created it [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1395.74s)]
*  Right and we're and uh, and we are certainly discovering that in this [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1401.26s)]
*  in this culture [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1405.66s)]
*  and that's why [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1407.18s)]
*  You know you could go on tiktok any which I don't recommend but you can go on tiktok anytime and you can it's a whole genre [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1409.1000000000001s)]
*  Of video now on tiktok where you've got these young women [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1415.1000000000001s)]
*  It's usually it's usually young women who do these videos these selfie videos where they're [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1418.46s)]
*  in tears [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1423.74s)]
*  crying [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1425.5800000000002s)]
*  Because they went out into the working world and they found it so miserable and depressing and empty [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1426.8600000000001s)]
*  And they just hate it and they don't want to work and they don't want to do it and they and they're in despair over it [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1433.34s)]
*  um [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1439.82s)]
*  and [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1441.34s)]
*  And that's that's exactly what's what's happened. I think we were we were [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1442.62s)]
*  You know the message to wait, so you're not only against gay adoption. You're against women working at banks [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1446.3s)]
*  Yeah [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1452.62s)]
*  For the most where did she get all these opinions, you know it [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1454.7s)]
*  It's not the ideal setup because I mean and just to be clear [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1458.3799999999999s)]
*  I don't [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1463.18s)]
*  uh [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1464.78s)]
*  I think that there are families where both parents have to work [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1467.42s)]
*  I think there are a lot of families where they think both parents have to work, but they don't actually have to [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1472.3s)]
*  It just depends on what your priorities are and if you're willing to make the sacrifices [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1476.94s)]
*  I think most families have you you know, people say to me all the time [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1480.46s)]
*  Well, i'd love to have i'd love her to be one income. I'd love to homeschool. I'd love to have a family that we can't afford it [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1483.26s)]
*  um [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1489.26s)]
*  I mean, but you went to harvard and had a big trust fund. It's easy for you to say right exactly. Yeah. Yeah [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1490.54s)]
*  No, you didn't have any trust funding. You didn't even go to college [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1496.78s)]
*  And you worked at blockbuster and then you told me this last night. I had no idea [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1499.26s)]
*  You worked at a couple blockbusters. I did. Yeah. Yeah, that was an assistant manager. I wanted to be said true. I was [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1503.3400000000001s)]
*  That's how low their standards were towards the end [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1509.5s)]
*  It was definitely toward the end. I left blockbuster and then they went out of business shortly thereafter [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1511.66s)]
*  So you you can connect the dots on that's not the first by the way [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1516.22s)]
*  It's not the first company you've worked at that's no longer with us, which is interesting. You are the destroyer. Um [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1518.86s)]

*  And that was the only income in the family. That was the only income in the family and no trust fund at all. No [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1551.18s)]
*  No [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1555.5s)]
*  No, uh, I no we uh, no savings of any kinds [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1556.46s)]
*  You know, this was a time [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1562.46s)]
*  There there was one time I remember I went to the gas station to get gas and my card was declined [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1564.94s)]
*  Insufficient funds and uh, and I [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1570.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm in the gas station. I have no money [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1574.22s)]
*  I can't and the gas thing is empty because like when you're broke your gas is always almost empty [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1575.8200000000002s)]
*  And so I had no gas I insufficient funds and I remember thinking [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1580.38s)]
*  This is after I had two kids already. This is how broke we were. Um [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1585.02s)]
*  But I remember thinking I'm gonna have to [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1589.3400000000001s)]
*  Ask someone at a gas station for money. I'm gonna have to do this. I can't believe i'm gonna have to but I didn't [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1592.3000000000002s)]
*  I just started looking under the under the chair for coins [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1596.62s)]
*  And I found about like a buck fifty in coins and I went and paid for gas a buck fifty [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1600.06s)]
*  Worth of gas and coins enough to get home and then we'll figure out the problem [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1604.78s)]
*  But anyway, the point is we had no money. Um [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1609.1s)]
*  We were very broke [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1612.1399999999999s)]
*  And you know money went a little bit farther back then but not that much farther. I mean this was this wasn't 50 years ago [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1613.82s)]
*  Right. How many years ago was this? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1618.54s)]
*  11 years ago [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1621.02s)]
*  11 years ago all of us remember 11 years ago. It was [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1623.5s)]
*  Same country. Yeah, it was the same country and um [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1627.9s)]
*  And we had so we we had one we we decided we wanted to have one income [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1631.82s)]
*  We wanted to have a one income family. So family of four on one income [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1635.74s)]
*  It was not a it was not a high income at all [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1638.7s)]
*  It can be done [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1641.74s)]
*  I think in most cases you just have to be willing to make the sacrifices [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1643.1s)]
*  And a lot of people aren't and that's fine too because you have to decide on what your priorities are [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1646.7s)]
*  And so you might say look it's a priority to us that we um [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1650.6999999999998s)]
*  Have a big enough house that each person can have their own room. We don't want to share rooms for kids [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1655.5s)]
*  It's a priority to us that we have two cars that we can go on vacation a nice vacation once a year [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1659.9799999999998s)]
*  That we can have two or three [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1664.54s)]
*  TVs that everyone can have a smartphone with all the plans and we want to have you know [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1666.54s)]
*  We want to have five different streaming subscriptions [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1671.34s)]
*  and we want to be able to eat out whenever we want like [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1673.8999999999999s)]
*  That's a priority to us and okay if that's a priority then yeah in a lot of cases you're going to need [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1677.18s)]
*  double income [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1682.22s)]
*  But if you're willing to say [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1683.42s)]
*  Okay, we're gonna we're gonna downsize our home [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1685.26s)]
*  Uh, we're gonna share bedrooms [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1688.38s)]
*  We're gonna have one tv. We're gonna have one car [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1691.26s)]
*  We're gonna we're gonna go on much more modest vacations [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1694.7s)]
*  and um [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1698.6200000000001s)]
*  And we're gonna cut things down to the bone a bit because it's worth it to us [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1700.22s)]
*  To be able to keep mom at home and to be able to homeschool or whatever it is [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1706.22s)]
*  So I think if you're if you're willing to say that a lot of people could do it, but do you think it is worth it? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1710.14s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1715.58s)]
*  Definitely why 100? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1716.8600000000001s)]
*  Um because a lot of other stuff doesn't matter really it's like there's no happiness in that [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1719.9s)]
*  Um, I I think I think that's clearly true [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1724.7s)]
*  Uh on the other hand, you know, it's it's a drag not having enough money [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1727.42s)]
*  I've had more than enough money most of my life, but I have had periods where [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1731.9s)]
*  Didn't have enough and had to sell stuff and everyone goes through that and it's it's a it's a bummer [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1735.82s)]
*  It's it's very hard. Like I say, yeah, I [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1741.34s)]
*  Having gone through it. It's it's it's really difficult [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1744.3799999999999s)]
*  I I much prefer having money to not having it [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1748.3s)]
*  But uh [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1752.14s)]
*  Not at the expense of having someone else raise my kids, so what's the upside of [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1755.1s)]
*  You know making the conscious decision to have [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1761.1s)]
*  The mother of your children raise those children [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1764.38s)]
*  The downside I mean you just you just described it like you're going to sacrifice in order to get that [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1768.7s)]
*  But if you do get that, what do you get? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1772.62s)]
*  uh [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1775.74s)]
*  Happiness in the in the home is a big thing not not perfectly happy. It's not [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1778.38s)]
*  You're going to have your your problems and your struggles and some of them may be financial [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1783.42s)]
*  And there can be some real misery that comes from that. I don't I don't deny it [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1787.82s)]
*  But it's just a fundamentally happier home in my experience [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1791.3400000000001s)]
*  Uh when the children are being raised by their mother by their parents the kid the kids are happier [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1796.8600000000001s)]
*  Uh, and and beyond happiness [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1804.46s)]
*  You [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1807.98s)]
*  You can control how your children are raised and you can raise them with [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1808.94s)]
*  a your value system and maintain that which which is [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1815.18s)]
*  Almost impossible if you're putting your kids in public school, let's say it's almost impossible because the kids are gonna they're gonna spend [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1819.26s)]
*  five days a week [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1827.18s)]
*  You know seven hours a day nine months a year for 12 or 13 years of their formative years [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1829.18s)]
*  Uh, not with you or your or your wife [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1835.02s)]
*  in this government indoctrination center [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1838.3799999999999s)]
*  around their peers [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1842.06s)]
*  And so inevitably they're going to be absorbing [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1844.06s)]
*  And so inevitably they're going to be absorbing [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1846.6200000000001s)]
*  They're going to start orienting themselves to the world based on that by looking at their peers [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1849.82s)]
*  Not even so much what their teachers are telling them, but what their peers are doing [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1854.54s)]
*  And that's what's going to happen. So so so at a certain point you're going to lose [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1858.7s)]
*  You run the risk that you're just going to lose them and that's why you have these parents who turn around and uh, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1864.3s)]
*  Everything they've instilled in their kids seems to have just gone out the window [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1870.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think this is a big reason why [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1873.98s)]
*  But then we're told that if you don't do that if you don't submit to the culture then your kids are out of step with their peers [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1877.34s)]
*  They're weird. They never quite fit in. They're just weird. They're weird [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1884.78s)]
*  Is that a risk is that a meaningful downside like what do you think of that? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1891.02s)]
*  I don't think it's meaningful [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1895.82s)]
*  I weird is [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1897.82s)]
*  There are bad kinds of weird, but this is a good kind of weird [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1899.82s)]
*  Um, yes, yeah, I hear this a lot people will say well [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1902.38s)]
*  How do you socialize them? Yeah, how do you socialize them? [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1907.66s)]
*  Do you want to have you want to keep your kid in a bubble? Yes, and it's like yeah, I do [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1911.5800000000002s)]
*  I I absolutely want to keep my kids in a bubble. I really do [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1917.5800000000002s)]
*  Not not a you know, but are they getting enough porn if they're in that bubble [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1922.22s)]
*  Right. Well enough porn enough time to get them to get in that bubble [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1927.98s)]
*  Enough porn enough time on tik tok. I mean all that all that sort of thing. That's that's the point [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1931.02s)]
*  You are supposed to be providing [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1936.46s)]
*  an environment for your child [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1938.7s)]
*  to grow and develop [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1941.42s)]
*  and mature [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1943.58s)]
*  physically morally spiritually [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1945.34s)]
*  Have a childhood have actual childhood experiences. I hear from people all the time people my age and older that say oh man [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1948.78s)]
*  I remember when I was a kid [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1954.86s)]
*  And we were outside we would run around the woods and we would be outside all the time playing tag and [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1956.54s)]
*  I just wish my kids had that because the kids these days are just on the screens all day [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1961.74s)]
*  They don't have a real childhood and I say that your kids can have that there's no reason why they can't have it [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1965.6599999999999s)]
*  My kids have that [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1971.5s)]
*  I work in media and and yet my kids have exactly that kind of childhood because [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1973.34s)]
*  We just determined from the beginning that our kids aren't they're gonna have a real childhood. They are going to [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1979.1s)]
*  Run outside and scrape their knees and and climb trees [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1984.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's what they're gonna do. That's the kind of that's the kind of childhood they should have [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1988.3000000000002s)]
*  And it is possible to have it. The only difference now is that it has to be a choice [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1992.38s)]
*  You know, I think I think 30 years ago [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1996.38s)]
*  That was just the default so more than a choice. I mean you have to organize [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=1999.42s)]
*  Well, you're the one with six kids who are homeschooled [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2002.7800000000002s)]
*  So you tell me but it it sounds from the outside like you have to reorganize your entire life around that goal [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2004.7800000000002s)]
*  You do it doesn't happen naturally right right it doesn't happen naturally [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2011.58s)]
*  That's why I said it has to be a priority if it's an actual priority [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2015.5s)]
*  If you really are lamenting [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2019.26s)]
*  That kids today don't have a real childhood, which I agree [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2022.06s)]
*  I think that many of them don't and I think it's a horrible tragedy really is [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2024.4599999999998s)]
*  But if you really care about that and if it troubles you [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2031.4199999999998s)]
*  Then yeah, you have to you have to make so what if you I mean if you don't mind if this is too personal just [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2035.5s)]
*  Just say stop being so creepy and I'll pull back but if you don't mind like describe [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2040.3s)]
*  In specific terms the steps that you've taken to protect your children and allow them a childhood and in a world that would deny them one [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2045.74s)]
*  Like what have you done? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2052.46s)]
*  Well, it starts with what? [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2053.9s)]
*  We don't send in the public school, you know, we we have always homeschooled from the beginning. So that's a big step [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2056.62s)]
*  They don't have phones. They don't have [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2062.46s)]
*  access to any screens [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2065.42s)]
*  Except for our family tv, we have a family tv [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2067.7400000000002s)]
*  We don't do there's a policy my wife and I have had [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2071.7400000000002s)]
*  Since the beginning is we don't do screens behind there will be no screens in a room that has a door on it [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2075.58s)]
*  So we have one tv and it's in a very public area of the house [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2084.14s)]
*  Where anyone can hear it when they walk in? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2088.54s)]
*  And and that's it. So we do have that like our kids can watch tv. They can't watch it all day [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2091.7400000000002s)]
*  But they can watch it and we're going to know anything that they watch [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2096.14s)]
*  You know, they're not going to just sit there on the tv and choose something and tell us what you want to watch [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2099.66s)]
*  If it's something i've never heard of well, you're not watching that until I can watch it first [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2103.58s)]
*  And they don't have any internet access [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2109.7400000000002s)]
*  At all, you know, no phones no tablets [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2113.34s)]
*  Nothing like that laptop no laptop. No no computer at all and our oldest kids are almost 12 now [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2116.94s)]
*  The the only exception we make is if we go on long car rides [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2123.5s)]
*  Which for us is four hours plus [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2127.34s)]
*  Then we have tablets that are for the car [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2130.14s)]
*  four hour plus car ride [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2132.86s)]
*  There's no internet on it. It's books and like educational games and and the tablets have that and in the car if it's four plus hours [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2135.18s)]
*  You can use those tablets [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2143.58s)]
*  And then when we get to our destination, we're taking the tablets back [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2146.46s)]
*  And then when we get to our destination we're taking the tablets back and i've and i've [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2149.58s)]
*  And i've noticed this that that even this this little bit of access to this that kind of technology that we do give to [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2155.82s)]
*  Our kids in the car in this really yeah in this really specific scenario [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2161.1800000000003s)]
*  You see how this it just has this pull on them. Yeah [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2166.2200000000003s)]
*  And it becomes a [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2169.7400000000002s)]
*  Especially if it's one, you know, we sometimes go places. It's a 15 hour 16 hour ride over a couple of days [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2171.58s)]
*  So during that time they do have the tablets for a while [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2177.1800000000003s)]
*  And when we get there, it's almost like a detox. Yeah, they they're they're just they're they're jonesing for the it's like giving them one jelly bean [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2181.02s)]
*  They want more exactly exactly and I had uh, and i've had to take you know [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2187.5s)]
*  What some people would consider extreme steps, uh to get them over that [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2191.42s)]
*  How extreme? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2196.2200000000003s)]
*  Well to me, it's not extreme because this is like what my dad would have done. But I remember it was last year [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2197.82s)]
*  We had just come back from a long car ride [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2203.34s)]
*  And uh, so we took the tablets away [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2206.06s)]
*  And then my my son it was seven at the time [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2208.46s)]
*  Freaked out like he wanted he started screaming that he wanted his tablet. Yeah, and I said, you know, we don't [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2212.78s)]
*  We're not that family. We don't we don't have seven-year-olds screaming about tablets. We're not going to do that [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2219.9s)]
*  And so I I said come here bud. Come over here [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2224.78s)]
*  I brought him over to the where our trash can is in the kitchen and I said here's where the tablet's going [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2227.02s)]
*  It's in the trash [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2231.5s)]
*  and uh [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2232.94s)]
*  And that's it. We're throwing it away. You're not getting it back. Did he have a funeral for it? [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2234.06s)]
*  Uh, you know emotionally in his heart he did he was he was [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2238.62s)]
*  Shocked. He was he was distraught. Um [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2243.16s)]
*  But we threw it away. I didn't give it back to him. It went in the trash [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2247.82s)]
*  And uh, like a year later, he got a new one. Um [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2251.1s)]
*  For the car [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2255.74s)]
*  And he freaked out and about 10 minutes later. He was fine and he was running around outside [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2257.9s)]
*  Using a stick like a lightsaber or whatever, but it shows you why most parents despite I think [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2263.02s)]
*  Wanting to do what you do. I do think a lot of parents will hear this and say man [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2268.86s)]
*  I would like to do that or I should have done that. Um [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2273.02s)]
*  But the reason they don't is the pushback from the kids is really intense [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2276.06s)]
*  denying kids [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2280.94s)]
*  Electronics denying them what all of their peers what all their friends have like it's it's hard [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2283.1600000000003s)]
*  It is hard it is hard and especially if it's easier, uh, we have it a little bit easier because our kids are [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2288.94s)]
*  homeschooled [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2295.56s)]
*  And most of their friends are like homeschool Christian families and most of them are on the same page [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2297.58s)]
*  Not all of them, but most of them are and it does make it easier. It certainly does [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2303.42s)]
*  If your kids in public school, it's gonna be a lot harder because they are [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2308.06s)]
*  There there's a whole culture, you know that comes out of these [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2311.66s)]
*  Out of the screens out of the devices there's a language that comes out of it [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2315.7400000000002s)]
*  And when I when I see one of my kids like one of the 12 year olds [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2320.46s)]
*  Or the or the eight-year-old [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2325.26s)]
*  Around one of their peers who are not part of the homeschool community, but just like a you know a kid from public school or something [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2327.1800000000003s)]
*  The difference is is stark. It really is in every way you can just the way that they speak [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2334.46s)]
*  Like I said, they have a different language that they pick up [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2339.98s)]
*  um [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2342.78s)]
*  The way that they carry themselves [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2343.74s)]
*  I think a lot of these kids are a lot more just sort of jaded and cynical [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2346.54s)]
*  They seem a lot harder to impress [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2351.1s)]
*  They're overstimulated. Yes [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2353.8999999999996s)]
*  They're not interested in [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2356.4599999999996s)]
*  Things outside of the screen [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2359.2599999999998s)]
*  um [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2362.06s)]
*  You know my son my 12 year old son is [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2363.74s)]
*  And I was the same way when I was when I was his age. I'm still this way [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2366.8599999999997s)]
*  But he goes through these phases where he becomes really obsessed [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2370.2999999999997s)]
*  With a certain topic and it changes it'll it'll change every four to six months. He picks a new topic that he's just [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2373.74s)]
*  Obsessed with it's the only thing he cares about is this topic [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2380.62s)]
*  and it could be anything from [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2384.14s)]
*  He went through a phase where he was obsessed with india native american culture. It could be lord of the rings. It could be [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2386.14s)]
*  uh anything [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2393.18s)]
*  Space, you know, he did a dinosaur thing as a lot of boys do anyway [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2394.7s)]
*  uh [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2399.9799999999996s)]
*  So when he's around his friends or he's around other kids he wants to talk about [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2401.98s)]
*  Whatever that is he wants to talk about this this thing that he's really interested in and he'll learn everything there is to know about it [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2405.9s)]
*  He'll end up knowing more about the subject than I do i'm learning from him about it [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2410.7s)]
*  um [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2415.42s)]
*  But he'll be around these other kids and he wants to that's what he wants to talk about he wants to talk about hey [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2416.22s)]
*  Let me tell you this really interesting thing I learned [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2420.78s)]
*  And uh with some of these kids they'll look at him like he's like he's weird, you know, because that's just not [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2424.06s)]

*  I've gotten a lot of trouble with some some in my audience. You're not allowed to criticize video games for marijuana [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2509.02s)]
*  Those are the two things. Yeah, I'm allowed to criticize. You really can't you really can't um, which which to me only [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2514.06s)]
*  Validates a lot of the criticisms that people are that attached to it because here's here's my thing with video games [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2521.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't think there's anything intrinsically wrong with them [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2526.62s)]
*  We don't we don't do video games with our kids because it's a screen based activity and we've just decided that [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2530.38s)]
*  We're not our kids are not going to have a childhood dominated by screens [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2537.26s)]
*  And so we're just not going to do that that's a decision that we made [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2541.34s)]
*  But there's nothing intrinsically wrong with them [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2545.18s)]
*  Uh, I I think I would [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2548.46s)]
*  A lot of the the gamers they'll they'll anytime I I offer some mild criticism of you know [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2551.42s)]
*  video games or [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2558.14s)]
*  What's your mild criticism? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2559.82s)]
*  It's not about the game itself it's about it's about the attachment to it [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2564.06s)]
*  You know, it's about it's about [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2568.06s)]
*  Revolving your whole life around it. And so that [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2571.02s)]
*  When we get into this conversation the video game fans will say to me. Well, this is no different [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2574.54s)]
*  You know, you're a football fan, which I am a big NFL fan [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2578.94s)]
*  And they say well, what's what's the difference between playing a video game and watching football on a sunday afternoon? [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2582.86s)]
*  And I think that's a valid point. I think that there probably is little difference [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2587.98s)]
*  I think there's a little bit of a difference but [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2591.1s)]
*  not much [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2593.66s)]
*  And I would say the same thing about being a sports fan that it's fine to like sports I do I love football [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2596.62s)]
*  It shouldn't dominate your life and there are people out there who just dominate their sports fandom is the central [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2603.3399999999997s)]
*  Thing about them it's their whole personality [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2611.1s)]
*  And that's excessive that should not be your personality. You know your your affinity for some group of guys playing a game [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2613.8199999999997s)]
*  Should not be your personality. It shouldn't be your identity [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2620.7s)]
*  And I and I and that's my point about video games. That's it. So that's why I say it's a very mild criticism [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2623.98s)]
*  You want to play the games? That's fine [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2628.54s)]
*  You don't need my permission [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2630.7799999999997s)]
*  But it should not be the central fact of your life. It shouldn't be your number one priority. You shouldn't have an [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2633.1s)]
*  um [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2640.62s)]
*  A a an attachment to it. You shouldn't have a you know, a a an excessive attachment [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2642.3799999999997s)]
*  To it, that's it [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2648.54s)]
*  And I think that's pretty reasonable, you know, why are people touchy about that? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2651.5s)]
*  People are they they [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2659.58s)]
*  It's part of the culture people take their people take their entertainment and their recreation very seriously [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2661.74s)]
*  And I think for a lot of people it just that is their [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2667.02s)]
*  The central fact of their identity and so they kind of take it personally they take it as a personal attack [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2669.98s)]
*  Which is not how I mean it [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2676.3s)]
*  Where are you on marijuana? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2678.22s)]
*  uh, I think it's [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2680.86s)]
*  Awful. I think it's terrible. I used to have a more kind of libertarian view of it. Yeah [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2682.7s)]
*  If you were to go back 10 years 15 years [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2688.7799999999997s)]
*  My view was I don't like it personally [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2691.58s)]
*  But you were never a weed smoker [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2694.7799999999997s)]
*  I i've had it. I've never been uh, years and years and years ago. Not not not in adulthood [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2697.58s)]
*  It's not for me. It's not for me [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2703.9s)]
*  but [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2706.62s)]
*  And my view used to be well, it's not for me but [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2707.58s)]
*  Probably all this I kind of bought into the war on drugs thing and all this money that we're spending [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2711.5s)]
*  To try to stop people for smoking it as a waste [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2716.94s)]
*  And so it should probably just be legal [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2719.9s)]
*  Even if I don't like it [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2722.7799999999997s)]
*  There's this argument [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2725.2599999999998s)]
*  From the marijuana fans that well, it's no different from uh than alcohol [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2727.8199999999997s)]
*  And we know how prohibition of alcohol worked out [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2733.18s)]
*  And so if we're gonna allow people to go out and get a drink why shouldn't they be able to go out pretty well [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2735.82s)]
*  I think I think cirrhosis deaths went way down didn't they I mean they did [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2739.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2743.9s)]
*  So i'm not i'm not convinced by the argument for that reason. I'm also not entirely convinced that alcohol and marijuana are [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2744.78s)]
*  Are comparable [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2752.3s)]
*  Uh for one thing an alcohol can be really bad and there's addiction and it destroys it can destroy families and lives [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2754.3s)]
*  alcohol is though [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2761.82s)]
*  At least a more social [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2763.98s)]
*  It's a social lubricant. Mm-hmm [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2766.54s)]
*  so [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2769.1000000000004s)]
*  If you're with a group of people and you're having a drink [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2770.54s)]
*  It can help you have kind of loosen up. You have a better time as long as you're not being excessive [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2773.7400000000002s)]
*  Now if somebody gets trashed [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2778.46s)]
*  Then it kind of ruins the time for everyone and that can happen [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2780.46s)]
*  I think marijuana is not like that. It's it it [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2783.34s)]
*  It kind of turns you inward it makes you anti-social [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2788.2200000000003s)]
*  You know, so if you're sitting around a table with some people and a couple of them are drinking a beer [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2791.76s)]
*  Even if you're not drinking you can have a perfectly nice time [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2800.32s)]
*  But if you're sitting around a table and a couple of the people are stoned [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2803.84s)]
*  It's like that's [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2807.36s)]
*  It's lame you don't even want to talk to that person they've got nothing to contribute. Yeah [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2809.76s)]
*  um [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2813.44s)]
*  Does seem to isolate people? Yeah, I think it's isolating. I think it turns you I think it turns you inward [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2814.4s)]
*  But regardless of all that my my my opinion was [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2819.36s)]
*  Yeah, it should probably just be legal [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2823.04s)]
*  but I also believe in [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2825.04s)]
*  When you get new data you get new facts. You need to analyze them. You need to be willing to change your mind [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2827.84s)]
*  And so we we have legalized it in many places across the country [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2833.6s)]
*  in many cities [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2837.44s)]
*  And i've been to these cities [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2839.44s)]
*  as many of us have [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2841.6s)]
*  Where where weed is now? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2843.12s)]
*  It's like cigarettes were 30 years ago. Everybody's smoking [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2845.36s)]
*  And I think the early returns are not good [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2849.04s)]
*  You don't think denver new york are pretty great. I really don't I think they're quite it's it's quite terrible [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2853.2s)]
*  It's not all because of weed [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2858.64s)]
*  but [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2861.28s)]
*  Just the experience of walking around everybody's high it reeks of weed everywhere [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2862.56s)]
*  How has this made anyone's life better that's my question that's what I want to know I i'd be willing to adjust my view on this [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2868.32s)]
*  And i've asked this question before I haven't gotten a satisfactory answer [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2874.56s)]
*  I've asked this question before I haven't gotten a satisfactory answer [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  But we've made weed legal in a lot of these places [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2879.3599999999997s)]
*  In what way has it has it has it measurably improved life? [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2882.16s)]
*  anywhere [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2887.7599999999998s)]
*  Now that it's legal. Well, I don't know. I mean it's degraded people to the point where they're very easy to control [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2889.2s)]
*  Don't you think that's an upside? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2895.8399999999997s)]
*  So if you're like running a criminal enterprise posing as a government and you don't want people to rebel violently against you [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2896.96s)]
*  Then you give them drugs so they won't [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2903.6s)]
*  And if I was if I was in a position of power politically then maybe I feel that way but for me [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2906.7200000000003s)]
*  That does like take three steps back. Like what is this? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2912.5600000000004s)]
*  The whole population is like addled with something, you know [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2916.1600000000003s)]
*  Ladies are on benzos. The kids are on amphetamines [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2921.1200000000003s)]
*  The young men are on weed. Yeah, like [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2924.88s)]
*  No one's in his right mind, but everybody's kind of grooving out [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2928.0s)]
*  to his own music and [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2932.48s)]
*  Testosterone levels have just like dropped through the floor. And so [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2934.72s)]
*  Probably not gonna have an insurrection when everyone's high, right? Yeah, it makes people compliant. It makes them uh [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2938.32s)]
*  Apathetic even more than I think people just sort of naturally are these days [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2946.46s)]
*  And of course in reality, these are all bad things so it kind of goes back to [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2951.68s)]
*  How has it made anyone's life better and right and I don't know i'm i'm i'm a simple person [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2957.36s)]
*  Maybe I can be guilty of being simplistic sometimes [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2963.36s)]
*  So if that's the case then guilty is charged but to me it's like [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2967.92s)]
*  I think a policy is bad [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2973.52s)]
*  If it makes people's lives worse and doesn't improve anything, what if it works in theory? What if it's a beautiful theory? [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2977.12s)]
*  Well theories are great and we it's then we can talk about it then it's a lot of fun to talk about [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2984.56s)]
*  It's like that famous the dagal line which I think is probably fake [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2988.7999999999997s)]
*  We know it works in practice. The question is does it work in theory? [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2992.64s)]
*  Yeah, and you feel like that's in in operation in the united states. It's like well, you know people have the right to x y or z [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=2996.08s)]
*  Therefore we're doing this and it's like [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3002.48s)]
*  Actually, that's a disaster but people have a right. You know what I mean? It's like there's no reference point in reality there [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3004.72s)]
*  It's just like the theory makes sense. Let's go with it. Yeah, and that's why I increasingly I when people start talking about their rights [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3010.64s)]
*  It it it doesn't mean a lot to me. I don't even know what people mean when they say it [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3017.68s)]
*  you know, i'm not trying to be pedantic but [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3023.68s)]
*  The next time someone says well, I have a right to this just ask them [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3027.68s)]
*  What do you mean you have a right to it? What does that mean? Oh, I know [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3030.7999999999997s)]
*  They really have no they don't know what they're saying [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3034.48s)]
*  I think the vast majority of people talking about their rights if you ask them to [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3036.56s)]
*  Define the word right [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3040.3199999999997s)]
*  They would not be able to do it define anywhere what's white supremacy what's racism what's what's anti-semitism? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3042.48s)]
*  What is any word used as a cudgel to make people be quiet and control them? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3048.2400000000002s)]
*  No one ever is forced to define what the term means, right? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3053.2000000000003s)]
*  In fact, there are even laws that i'm you know around those questions [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3056.32s)]
*  That are laws they carry punishments and the term is never defined [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3060.32s)]
*  Yeah, I just I feel like this is a trend [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3066.0s)]
*  where language [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3068.6400000000003s)]
*  Isn't used to communicate it's used to control and therefore it has to remain not fully defined [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3070.24s)]
*  Right, and that's why I think [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3075.7599999999998s)]
*  All I can do in response to that is if it's one of these terms that doesn't mean anything anymore. Yeah, then it then [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3078.72s)]
*  It it's not persuasive to me in an argument, right? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3087.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a term that has become not useful [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3091.4399999999996s)]
*  And it may have been useful at a time [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3094.72s)]
*  It may even be a term that used to have a definition or should have a definition, right? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3096.48s)]
*  But there are a lot of terms that [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3101.6s)]
*  Are just not useful anymore in a conversation because they don't clarify anything. They don't what? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3103.76s)]
*  well [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3108.64s)]
*  Right, you know rights. That's one it's just not it's not it [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3110.0s)]
*  I'm not saying rights don't exist [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3113.36s)]
*  I'm saying it's not a useful term in a conversation most of the time because when somebody says oh I have a right to this [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3114.72s)]
*  I don't know what they mean by that and I think they don't know what they mean by that, right? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3121.92s)]
*  Um, I don't think they care actually [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3125.3599999999997s)]
*  And uh and and but also [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3128.72s)]
*  racism [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3131.5s)]
*  White supremacy anti-semitism any any of the the isms. These are all these are not useful terms anymore [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3133.04s)]
*  because [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3139.92s)]
*  You know when you're calling someone racist [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3141.44s)]
*  That doesn't tell me anything about him actually it could be if you're if you're pointing to a guy saying that guy's racist [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3144.7999999999997s)]
*  maybe [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3150.16s)]
*  He thinks that all black people are inferior and should be enslaved. That's racist [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3151.44s)]
*  So maybe that's what you're telling me about him [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3155.76s)]
*  But you could be trying to tell me that that's a guy who understands that [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3158.0s)]
*  You know young black males are disproportionately violent and he's and he has pointed that out [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3163.2000000000003s)]
*  So you could be using the term to describe that also which is not actually racist at all [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3169.04s)]
*  So when you say racist, I don't know what you mean. So it's just it's not a useful term. You need to be more specific [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3174.2400000000002s)]
*  It means something I don't like [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3178.64s)]
*  Right like something that gets in my way, right? There's there's yeah, exactly. You're saying there's something about that guy that I don't like [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3180.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I want this thing and you're between me and this thing and how do I get you out of my way? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3188.16s)]
*  How do I incapacitate or destroy you so I can get what I want? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3194.16s)]
*  You're racist or any of those other terms like you're in the way exactly [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3197.68s)]
*  I should have asked you this but i'm interested if you don't mind. What is your spiritual practice at home? [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3204.08s)]
*  Like you you educate your children yourself you and your wife, I assume your wife primarily educates your children [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3208.96s)]
*  But as head of head of household, how do you think about your requirements as like the spiritual leader of your home? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3215.6s)]
*  Yeah, well we're catholic. Um [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3221.28s)]
*  So and we pray together every night as a family which I think is is uh [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3224.64s)]
*  And we can get lazy about that. I think a lot of families do but I think it's [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3229.6s)]
*  Really important doesn't have to be anything [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3234.16s)]
*  You know, it doesn't need to be a two-hour [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3236.24s)]
*  Routine but but you say your prayers before bed, right? Yeah as a family [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3239.3599999999997s)]
*  On all of you all eight of you. Yeah. Well not the babies and two-year-olds. They they get out of it for now [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3244.3199999999997s)]
*  But uh, well basically you've got a whole congregation. Yeah, we do. Yeah [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3248.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh on you know, it's I think it's important to be on your knees [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3252.8799999999997s)]
*  This is just a bottle physically. Yeah physically on our knees and you know, why? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3256.7999999999997s)]
*  because it's a it's a it's a [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3261.7599999999998s)]
*  It's a it's a [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3263.92s)]
*  A symbol of humility and submission before god [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3266.8s)]
*  Now you don't have to be on your knees to pray. There's a perfectly valid prayer if you're not on your knees [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3270.7200000000003s)]
*  but um [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3275.76s)]
*  If you can I think you should be and I think it's a good and I think it's a good image [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3277.36s)]
*  For the kids to see it's a good image. It's a good it's good for my kids to see me on my knees praying [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3282.7200000000003s)]
*  It's good for them to see why? [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3288.96s)]
*  Um [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3291.84s)]
*  Because to my kids I am the authority figure in the home [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3294.32s)]
*  Uh, I don't answer to anybody in the home. I don't have to ask anyone's permission for anything [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3299.44s)]
*  and [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3307.36s)]
*  I'm ultimately like the source of discipline in the home as the father as I should be [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3308.64s)]
*  But for them to see that oh even even that guy even dad [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3314.16s)]
*  Who in the home, you know, this is his castle but even he is [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3317.8399999999997s)]
*  Um showing submission and obedience and humility [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3324.08s)]
*  Toward towards some power above him. I think that's a really powerful image for [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3328.72s)]
*  For my kids to have and that I had with my with my own dad growing up [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  so [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3338.3199999999997s)]
*  Uh, so we do that [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3340.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think this is also [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3343.44s)]
*  I think i'm at the point where my it's kind of like my my whole ideology my political ideology at this point is [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3345.92s)]
*  That I want my kids to go to heaven [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3353.36s)]
*  I want my kids to go to heaven and I want them I want them to be good and happy people. That's what I want [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3357.36s)]
*  So everything that we do in the home and we're not perfect we don't get this right perfectly not even close to it but [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3363.36s)]
*  Everything we do in the home should be [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3370.2400000000002s)]
*  But everything we do in the home should be tailored towards that end [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3372.24s)]
*  To help our kids be good and happy people [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3378.56s)]
*  And uh [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3383.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's also those are the policies that I support, you know [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3385.7599999999998s)]
*  I I this is this is that that's my that's my those are my politics sounds like christian nationalism, man [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3389.52s)]

*  Never heard defined. Um, well that's wow. What an interesting way to frame it. What a what a great way to frame it [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3400.56s)]
*  What do you think of as your duties as a husband and father? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3406.96s)]
*  I think it's um [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3413.92s)]
*  Provide [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3420.0s)]

*  In more ways than one [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3428.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, you're providing financially [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3430.64s)]
*  Like bringing home the bacon is uh is is a really important part of that and I think that the father should do that [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3433.4399999999996s)]
*  Um, but you're also providing [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3439.9199999999996s)]

*  Uh, and maybe i'll never have to do I hope I never have to do it [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3465.2799999999997s)]
*  But but but it's not just about that [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3468.88s)]
*  You know as a man [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3472.0s)]
*  You should be I believe a a stabilizing presence [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3474.24s)]
*  to your family [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3478.72s)]
*  Like when they're around you they should just feel safer and calmer [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3480.64s)]
*  Not necessarily because they're worried that a bad guy is going to but there's that's part of it, but it's not just that [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3485.92s)]
*  like they're they're [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3490.88s)]
*  The world's a confusing place. The world is a dark place [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3492.88s)]
*  Everyone has anxieties [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3495.92s)]

*  And if something goes wrong if there's um, you know the shit hits the fan [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3505.12s)]
*  There's there's a problem [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3510.56s)]
*  And they should be able to know that okay, well, thank god dad's here [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3512.72s)]
*  Or thank god my husband's here [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3517.52s)]

*  You know I [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3541.04s)]
*  Maybe I err too much in that direction [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3542.8s)]
*  But if you had cancer you wouldn't tell anybody [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3545.6800000000003s)]

*  I think i've been conditioned that that they aren't allowed to say out this part out loud, but I think it's true that [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3738.1600000000003s)]

*  We have been conditioned to believe that opening up and sharing your emotions is just a good thing crying in front of your girlfriend [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3762.4s)]
*  Right. She really wants you to cry. That's what we've been told [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3768.1600000000003s)]
*  and your [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3771.76s)]
*  and your girlfriend might [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3772.88s)]
*  Might tell you that she might tell you. Oh, you know what? I really want you to open up more [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3775.28s)]
*  But what's she thinking inside? Right. He's such a bitch. Yes [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3779.6800000000003s)]
*  That's why you never cry in front of your wife or your girlfriend like never [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3784.32s)]
*  I mean [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3789.92s)]
*  In the rarest of cases you have a you have a a a close family member dies. That's one thing [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3791.04s)]
*  Your daughter walking down the aisle, but other than that just never cry in front of them [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3798.16s)]
*  Especially not [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3805.98s)]
*  because you're [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3808.4s)]
*  stressed out [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3810.0s)]
*  Because you're just dealing with some kind of anxiety [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3811.36s)]
*  You know and people think that this is extreme or they or they want to pretend that well if women can cry the men can cry [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3815.04s)]
*  But just I like like imagine a scenario [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3821.76s)]
*  Uh [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3826.16s)]
*  Let's say you're in the car [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3828.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's the weather gets really bad and then you get lost maybe the gps goes out [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3831.36s)]
*  And and you're lost [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3836.8s)]
*  Weather's bad. It's really stressful. One of those stressful things is that it's dark, you know [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3838.48s)]
*  It would not be uncommon in that scenario for if you're with your wife [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3844.0s)]
*  She might start crying like she's very nervous she starts crying. Oh my gosh, we're lost [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3848.7999999999997s)]
*  What are we going to do? [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3854.3999999999996s)]
*  And that would not be an uncommon thing [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3856.24s)]
*  And as a man, you don't think less of your wife for that [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3858.7999999999997s)]
*  Hopefully you're there to comfort her and say no, I got this we're gonna be fine. We got it [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3862.56s)]
*  Now you as the man [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3867.04s)]
*  If you started crying [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3868.7999999999997s)]
*  Because you're stressed out and lost and it's dark and it's raining and you don't know where you're going [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3870.64s)]
*  And your wife saw that [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3875.44s)]
*  She will never look at you the same way again [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3877.44s)]
*  She will always remember that she'll remember the time when it was [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3880.4s)]
*  Stressful and she needed you to take over and be in control and figure it out and you started crying like a little bitch [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3884.56s)]
*  She will always remember it [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3890.88s)]
*  Um [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3893.92s)]
*  And I think we again, I think we all intuitively understand that we understand that it's it's okay in that scenario for the woman to cry [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3894.96s)]
*  Is normal for the man to cry. It's ridiculous. It's shameful [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3900.08s)]
*  It's shameful [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3903.44s)]
*  But it's interesting that you said at the outset we've been told the opposite and it's almost like [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3904.88s)]
*  What's not almost like it is [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3911.68s)]
*  That all the ingredients in a successful marriage and family and in fact in a successful life [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3913.76s)]
*  Have been systematically targeted [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3919.76s)]
*  By the people in charge and their proxies for destruction [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3923.36s)]
*  So like everything you need to know to have a successful life has been undermined like no [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3927.2000000000003s)]
*  You definitely cry in front of your wife like show your feelings. No [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3931.68s)]
*  She should go get a higher paying job than you [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3935.9199999999996s)]
*  Like you should do more of the housework like you need to be the woman actually in the relationship [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3939.2s)]
*  No, it's totally fine to spend all saturday playing video games while getting high or whatever like [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3944.96s)]
*  We're getting not just like three degrees off good advice, but we're getting 180 degrees opposite advice [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3951.9199999999996s)]
*  In this case [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3957.92s)]
*  It's like our society. I'm not it's not like our society has been targeted intentionally for destruction [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3959.12s)]
*  And i'm wondering why where does that come from if you read? [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3966.4s)]
*  The feminine mystique by betty fredan which came out I think in the early 60s, you know over 50 years ago [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3969.92s)]
*  that book [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3976.16s)]
*  Is like a recipe for destroying a society and yet it was promoted. That's sort of the the root of modern feminism [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3978.16s)]
*  What is that is it spiritual are these [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3986.7400000000002s)]
*  Like spiritual forces working to destroy the west are they what you give any clue? [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3990.42s)]
*  Uh, it's so comprehensive. Yeah, everything you've said is the opposite [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=3996.26s)]
*  Of what your kids are taught. Yeah in school. It's uh, it's it's certainly a spiritual attack [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4000.5s)]
*  This this all feels demonic because it is in my opinion [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4006.42s)]
*  uh [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4010.9s)]
*  It's also it's it's all an effort I think to just to destroy the family to to [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4012.42s)]
*  Upend the fundamental societal institution, which is the family [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4017.86s)]
*  um [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4021.78s)]
*  Because [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4024.02s)]
*  All of the you know nefarious forces that want to control us [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4026.02s)]
*  Want to control what we do control what we think? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4031.2200000000003s)]
*  control what our children think [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4034.5s)]
*  The family is an enemy to them. The family is the one thing [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4037.3s)]
*  Standing in the way. Yeah [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4041.54s)]
*  And so it's all about destroying the family even even the things that seem little like it's okay to cry in front of your wife [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4044.58s)]
*  No, it's not it's not and and that again that's an attack on the family because if a man takes that advice [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4051.78s)]
*  It starts at acting feminine and emotional [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4057.86s)]
*  It's going to hurt his marriage might destroy his marriage. Yes, and so [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4061.94s)]
*  that's the ultimate goal and um [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4066.1s)]
*  And I think a lot of it I mean you mentioned feminism I think a lot of this does go back to feminism I think that [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4069.06s)]
*  Was way more destructive than any plague in history [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4075.94s)]
*  Feminism by far in a way is the most destructive ideology in human history. It's not even close. I agree with that [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4079.8399999999997s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4085.7s)]
*  well [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4087.14s)]
*  start with the body count [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4088.58s)]
*  60 million dead babies [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4090.58s)]
*  Since row just in this country and if we're talking worldwide, you know [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4093.46s)]
*  Hundreds of millions, but in this country 60 million children were killed by through abortion, which is the feminist sacrament [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4099.0599999999995s)]
*  So you really you don't even need to go beyond that. That's that's kind of enough I think to make the point but of course you can [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4108.5s)]
*  Ever since feminism took hold [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4116.26s)]
*  Divorce rates have skyrocketed [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4119.38s)]
*  Birth rates have plummeted [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4121.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean we're watching the disintegration of the family unit in real time [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4124.5s)]
*  And people are are less happy. They're unhappy. I mean as much as there's this cliche kind of image of the [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4129.14s)]
*  1950s housewife who you know was was was depressed and [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4136.64s)]
*  and it was all the hollywood films are always like [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4141.9400000000005s)]
*  With this with this image of the the housewife was depressed and she was on whatever drugs secretly and [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4145.38s)]
*  You know, the the husband was off having sex with the secretary [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4153.0599999999995s)]
*  And most of that is just hollywood [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4157.219999999999s)]
*  It's a hollywood cartoon [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4159.38s)]
*  and in reality [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4161.46s)]

*  You do have one huge advantage [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4308.740000000001s)]
*  um one enviable advantage which is that [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4311.3s)]
*  Which is the same advantage that that every young man has had that you're you're young [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4315.22s)]
*  You're hopefully physically healthy [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4319.219999999999s)]
*  You're not married you have no kids you have no dependence [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4322.74s)]
*  So you can [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4326.66s)]
*  It's very low stakes [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4328.82s)]
*  And you can go anywhere and try anything [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4330.82s)]
*  Right like you don't if you're looking around and saying well there are no jobs in my town. I can't find any jobs [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4335.38s)]
*  Go to a different town go anywhere [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4343.54s)]
*  Um, you can go and if you end up living in your car for a week or two months, it's not great [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4346.74s)]
*  That sucks, but you you can do that because it's just you [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4353.219999999999s)]
*  Now for me when I I got six kids so if things fall apart for me [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4357.94s)]
*  It's much higher stakes and it's not as simple as I can't just like go anywhere and try to do anything [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4362.5s)]
*  At this point. I can't just like okay. Well, i'll go get a job at mcdonald's. It's not gonna work [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4367.38s)]
*  I got all these kids to take care of [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4371.219999999999s)]
*  But for you you you can go anywhere and do anything and you can take risks and if it doesn't work out [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4373.9400000000005s)]
*  It'll be hard, but it won't be disastrous [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4380.1s)]
*  um [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4383.860000000001s)]
*  So that's one thing [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4385.38s)]
*  and [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4387.54s)]
*  And that's your whatever your professional vocation is [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4388.42s)]
*  But there's the personal vocation [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4391.54s)]
*  That I think for all men is the same which is that every man [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4393.7s)]
*  Is called to be a father [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4398.42s)]
*  every man [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4400.66s)]
*  For most men that will come in the form of biological fatherhood. Not all there are other forms of fatherhood [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4403.22s)]
*  Their spiritual fatherhood. I think some men are called to religious life [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4409.54s)]
*  If you're catholic called to the priesthood, you don't get married, but you're you are still a father in a spiritual sense [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4413.62s)]
*  But every man is called to fatherhood in some sense. No man. No man is called to to live for himself only [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4419.14s)]
*  And serve only himself [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4424.740000000001s)]
*  No man is called to live a life where they [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4426.42s)]
*  Go to work come home play video games have no one depending on them [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4429.54s)]
*  Um, no one that they love [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4434.18s)]
*  No one is called to that life [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4436.740000000001s)]
*  So go and pursue that you know, go pursue that [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4440.02s)]
*  and go pursue it fearlessly [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4443.46s)]
*  and know what you're looking for and realize that [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4445.7s)]
*  There are a lot of women who are also looking for the same thing. I hear from [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4449.3s)]
*  conservative Christian men all the time saying [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4454.56s)]
*  I'm conservative. I'm christian. There are no good women left. Yes [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4457.9400000000005s)]
*  There are no there are no women out there who share my values constantly you hear that [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4461.139999999999s)]
*  But then I also hear from women all the time who are conservative christians saying i'm conservative. I'm christian [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4464.82s)]
*  There are no good men. There are no men who share my values [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4469.62s)]
*  And i'm like, well, you know you guys [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4472.98s)]
*  You're both out there you you both exist. I know you're out there [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4475.7s)]
*  um [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4479.46s)]
*  so you just have to pursue it and pursue it fearlessly and know what you're looking for and [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4481.3s)]
*  um [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4486.58s)]
*  And don't waste your time as a man like don't waste your time with women who you know, don't share your fundamental values [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4487.46s)]
*  when I [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4493.94s)]
*  When I met my wife [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4495.62s)]
*  We got engaged [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4498.02s)]
*  Six months later. We got engaged. So it was a quick it was quick [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4500.74s)]
*  And uh, we talked about on our first date we talked about [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4504.82s)]
*  Everything we talked about religion politics [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4509.3s)]
*  Everything just got it all out in the open [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4513.22s)]
*  Because at that point we were both, you know, I was 25 she was 24 but uh, so young you're getting old. Yeah, but [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4516.18s)]
*  By today's standards that's that's you know young to to be um [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4524.1s)]
*  getting married [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4527.9400000000005s)]
*  But we didn't want to we just didn't want to waste time. Like what's the what's the point? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4529.46s)]
*  If we if we have if we if our fundamental values don't align then this this can only end in heartbreak [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4533.14s)]
*  So there's no point i'm not going to waste my time. I'm not going to waste two years of my life [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4539.7s)]
*  Dating this person when there's no future [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4544.02s)]
*  And I know for a fact that the heartbreak is coming. It's the only way it can end and i'm just delaying it for no apparent reason [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4547.14s)]
*  i'm not going to do that, so [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4555.78s)]
*  We laid all that out really early on [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4558.34s)]
*  and um [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4560.9800000000005s)]
*  People ask like well, how do you know that someone's values align with yours? [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4563.3s)]
*  Ask them [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4567.86s)]
*  That's that's one way to find out now somebody can lie [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4569.22s)]
*  but [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4572.66s)]
*  You could weed out a lot of people just by asking [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4574.0199999999995s)]
*  And then and then after you've done that and you go to the polygraph stage, right polygraph [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4577.379999999999s)]
*  uh [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4582.339999999999s)]
*  But that's where dating comes in and you kind of you you get to know them a little bit [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4585.46s)]
*  It doesn't have to be that long. You don't need to date them for five years [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4589.299999999999s)]
*  It doesn't take that long to get to know someone to to know what they're really about. I think [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4592.58s)]
*  And if somebody's a total fraud if they're a terrible person [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4597.7s)]
*  and [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4600.26s)]
*  Most people are not good at hiding it [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4601.38s)]
*  Like I think most of us can tell I could talk to someone for two hours or less [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4603.780000000001s)]
*  Of course, I can talk to someone for 20 minutes [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4607.3s)]
*  easily [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4609.46s)]
*  um [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4610.26s)]
*  And if you're dating someone for six months, that's more than enough time. I mean all the time you spend with them [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4611.62s)]
*  It's more than enough time to figure out what they're really about [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4617.54s)]
*  so [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4620.900000000001s)]
*  and it's still possible and uh, and and and my that's my main message to young men is that uh, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4622.42s)]
*  You know, there's this kind of what do they call it [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4628.339999999999s)]
*  Mig-tau men go their own way movement online among like some right-wing men [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4631.7s)]
*  In the what they the manosphere [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4636.74s)]
*  What does that mean men go their own way? I I guess it it basically means uh, the whole system is rigged against men [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4639.219999999999s)]
*  And the family courts are rigged. Yeah, everything's rigged. It's all true, which is true. Yeah, that's true [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4646.42s)]
*  I don't deny it. What I deny is their conclusion, which is that [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4652.98s)]
*  It's hopeless men just need to go their own way do their own thing like like go be gay [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4656.18s)]
*  I [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4663.700000000001s)]
*  Don't think that they would sounds pretty gay to me to me it does to me it does [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4666.18s)]

*  What are you gonna do? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4785.06s)]

*  And by the way, the end will be bad like you're gonna die in pain and afraid. Okay, we know that but knowing all of that [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4802.66s)]
*  you still like [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4808.82s)]
*  Have to be courageous and just jump face first into it. Anyway, I mean that's kind of the whole point, right? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4810.98s)]
*  Right and especially when you have kids once you have kids [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4815.78s)]
*  the possibility [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4819.54s)]
*  of tragedy [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4821.78s)]
*  Increases exponentially. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean now now you because before it was like all the tragic things that can happen to you [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4823.62s)]
*  Now it's what are all the tragic things that can happen to my kids. Oh, yeah [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4831.38s)]
*  And then times up by however many kids you have. Yeah [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4834.9800000000005s)]
*  and then you've got your wife and it's like [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4838.1s)]
*  There are so many horrible ways that this could go. Oh, yeah [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4840.42s)]
*  And may and may right but but then but then it if any of that happens, what's the end result? The end result is [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4845.14s)]
*  Could be misery and despair [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4853.14s)]
*  Okay [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4856.02s)]
*  So then your solution is just to embrace misery and despair at the outset. Yeah, because you're afraid that it might happen agree [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4857.54s)]
*  um [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4865.62s)]
*  And I and I by the end, you know, I would rather [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4867.38s)]
*  For me if i'm going to end up [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4871.38s)]
*  miserable and in some tragic scenario, which I hope doesn't happen [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4873.38s)]
*  I'd rather it be because I went out and [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4878.58s)]
*  Like lived a life. It's one of the saddest things about this country. The country's getting sicker despite all of our wealth and technology [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4881.86s)]
*  Americans aren't doing well overall obesity heart disease autoimmune conditions all kinds of horrible chronic illnesses [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4888.26s)]
*  Weird cancers are all on the rise probably a lot of reasons for this [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4894.900000000001s)]
*  But one of them definitely is americans don't eat very well anymore [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4898.02s)]
*  They don't eat real food instead the industrial substitutes and it's not good [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4901.379999999999s)]
*  It's time for something new and that's where masa chips come in [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4906.82s)]
*  masa has decided to revive real food by creating snacks how they used to be made how they're supposed to be made a masa chip has [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4910.259999999999s)]

*  That's just a fact like that. We shouldn't hide that from ourselves actually like that's something horrible is going to happen to you for sure [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4968.26s)]
*  You're going to get the diagnosis somebody loves going to get the diagnosis or worse [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4974.42s)]

*  Yeah [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4983.38s)]
*  Right. I mean you're running toward the sound of gunfire and away from it. That's like your whole role [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4984.42s)]
*  Yeah, I I totally agree that and that's that's [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4989.06s)]
*  of all the unpopular messages that we've talked about that's probably the most unpopular is is [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4992.42s)]
*  That like it's going to end in tragedy no matter what we're all going to die. Like we're all going to die. Oh, yeah, it's bad [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=4998.66s)]
*  Right [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5004.58s)]
*  It's bad [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5005.7s)]
*  That's the thing that nobody wants to think about and talk about [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5007.06s)]
*  We should probably think about and talk about it a lot more than we do [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5009.62s)]
*  Oh the more you think about it the the lighter you're bearing and the more cheerful you are [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5012.26s)]
*  If I was I was reading someone recently who said [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5018.34s)]
*  um [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5022.02s)]
*  You know meditating on death every day is the is the most certain way to joy and cheerfulness and lightness. I think that's right [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5023.06s)]
*  I I kind of agree with that. I mean I read a book [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5031.3s)]
*  There's this um [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5035.22s)]
*  There was a book that was written years ago called denial of death [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5036.900000000001s)]
*  You ever read that? No [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5039.860000000001s)]
*  And i'm blanking on the name of the guy who wrote it. It'll come to me. But [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5042.58s)]
*  Anyway, the book is called denial of death. I don't agree with it's kind of psychoanalytical. There's a lot of psychobabble in it [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5046.34s)]
*  Uh, it was written by an author [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5053.3s)]
*  Who ironically wrote this book? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5055.780000000001s)]
*  published it [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5058.66s)]
*  One I believe a Pulitzer and died and died of cancer. I think he didn't know that he had it when he wrote this book [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5060.34s)]
*  But then he published the book and he died [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5066.74s)]
*  But anyway his his his kind of theory was that [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5068.74s)]
*  like all of [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5073.62s)]
*  Modern society is actually fundamentally set up [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5075.219999999999s)]
*  To distract us from the fact that we're going to die. Of course that that terror of death is what drives [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5080.0199999999995s)]
*  everything [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5086.66s)]
*  Um, and he takes that farther than I would probably take it [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5088.179999999999s)]
*  but [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5091.86s)]
*  I think there's actually a lot of truth to that. I remember I read this book and I and I and I and I and I [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5093.46s)]
*  Could see a lot of that in my own my own life [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5097.62s)]
*  but then I [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5100.42s)]
*  I discovered that that once I once I started actually thinking about that and meditating on it [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5101.86s)]
*  Maybe not literally meditating but really thinking about it [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5106.42s)]
*  I did become I became less fearful somehow of it [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5109.22s)]
*  Of course, because you've you've looked the monster in the face and like accepted, you know, there is something [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5113.38s)]
*  Snuffling under your bed, you know, okay [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5119.04s)]
*  so how have your um [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5122.5s)]
*  Well two-part question how have your views changed [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5124.9s)]
*  And how has the definitions became definitions of conservatism changed in say the past 20 years? Let's start with you [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5128.9s)]
*  I don't know that any of my views have [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5138.66s)]
*  They haven't fundamentally changed [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5140.9s)]
*  I've become more radical. I've certainly become radicalized on pretty much every issue. I'm just farther to the right on everything [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5142.9s)]
*  Uh my whole life i've just been I started on the right I come from a conservative catholic family [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5150.5s)]
*  and so i'm already starting like way over here and [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5156.34s)]
*  Everything that's happened in the country and also in my personal life has only just moved me farther and farther [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5160.18s)]
*  So that's the only way that my views and where does that lead at the end? Like what's your view of francisco franco? [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5167.06s)]
*  Where does it lead in the end? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5174.74s)]
*  No, like what's so if you start right and you keep going right where do you wind up? [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5176.74s)]
*  Are we still filming is the question? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5181.0599999999995s)]
*  Where is the 80 year old matt walsh on the issues? [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5185.78s)]
*  That'll be interesting it'll be interesting to check in i'll be long gone but um, but I think so that that's that's my own personal trajectory [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5190.5s)]
*  The definition of conservatism though [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5200.58s)]
*  Um [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5203.22s)]
*  Has has only changed in that I think it's [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5205.46s)]
*  In that it [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5211.62s)]
*  Has no definition. I think it's like so many we talked about the words that don't mean anything anymore [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5213.0599999999995s)]
*  Words that used to be useful and maybe used to mean something and they just don't anymore because of how they've been [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5217.78s)]
*  misused and abused and overused [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5222.72s)]
*  Uh, and I think conservatism is uh, another one of those words. I just yeah when you when you tell me now [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5225.22s)]
*  How that someone is conservative [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5230.66s)]
*  Uh, I I don't it doesn't tell me a lot about them. I don't know what you mean [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5234.5s)]
*  It generally means i'm not gonna like them. Um, yeah, well, they're gonna be some kind of fraud, you know in the internet [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5238.58s)]
*  Uh luring people with [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5245.86s)]
*  False prophecy. That's kind of what I that's that's my gut reaction. So discredited has that word become [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5247.94s)]
*  but I mean what [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5253.54s)]
*  The reason I asked this it's a moving target [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5255.62s)]
*  Of course, it means something different in every generation or maybe every year [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5257.94s)]
*  But because donald trump just got elected after four probably the worst four years since the american civil war [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5261.38s)]
*  Under joe biden there is this like large group tens of millions of people who are aligned in this thing [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5268.259999999999s)]
*  This movement this block of voters this ideology and what is it and how has it changed? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5275.0599999999995s)]
*  First [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5280.52s)]
*  These are big questions matt so i'm gonna let you i'm gonna give you a second to pause, okay [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5285.4800000000005s)]
*  Because I don't know what it is exactly is my point. I don't know what I think it's [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5290.040000000001s)]
*  I know what it isn't I think [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5294.4400000000005s)]
*  So one thing that unites us is that we have this general idea of wokeness leftism, whatever you want to call it [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5297.72s)]
*  Uh, and we don't like that [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5306.280000000001s)]
*  So I think we all have that in common, you know we when we look at a [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5308.759999999999s)]
*  Woman with blue hair and a nose piercing [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5313.96s)]
*  Everyone on the right we could look at that woman and we could say we probably don't like her [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5318.5199999999995s)]
*  And we probably don't agree with anything she thinks [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5322.28s)]
*  So we we don't agree with the blue hairs [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5325.5599999999995s)]
*  That's one thing we have in common and and the main thing that we don't agree with them on is that [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5328.04s)]
*  We think free speech is like a foundational concept the foundational concept of the united states [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5333.0s)]
*  And if you have an opinion you ought to be able to express it and I thought this was what everybody agreed on [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5337.799999999999s)]
*  I thought this was why they voted for trump shows you how dumb I am [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5342.759999999999s)]
*  And then I wake up and I see these people many of whom I know [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5345.639999999999s)]
*  scolding [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5348.82s)]
*  rogan me [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5350.2s)]
*  Just scolding in general you you're not supposed to platform that person or that set of ideas or that those are words that shouldn't be spoken [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5352.28s)]
*  And i'm like what you know, we're a hundred days into this and already people I thought were on my side [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5360.84s)]
*  Are mad because of [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5367.32s)]
*  Like naughty words or concepts or ideas or questions questions. Yeah, literally people on the so-called right are mad [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5369.4s)]
*  About asking questions. It's like a parody or something [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5377.08s)]
*  I thought that's like we made fun of the left like they'd be like just asking questions [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5380.28s)]
*  Your questions are more than questions. They're assaults on me [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5384.679999999999s)]
*  And i'm literally hearing people on the right say that [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5388.2s)]
*  About me so it pisses me off, but not it's not just me like what the hell is going on [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5391.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't take you seriously if you use the word [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5397.32s)]
*  Platforming [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5400.9s)]
*  Yeah negative. I I don't I don't take you seriously. I've already lost respect for you [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5402.36s)]
*  I agree that to me that's a leftist thing that to me that's the blue when I think of the blue hair [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5407.16s)]
*  Woman with the nose piercing. I think of her as someone who scolds you for why did you platform that person? [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5412.04s)]
*  Well, that's why I don't like her in you know, all things being cool. I'd feel sorry for her [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5417.16s)]
*  She's got blue hair in a nose ring. There's no man who loves her like I feel sad for her [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5421.24s)]
*  That would be my default view [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5425.08s)]
*  The only reason I don't like her is because she's scolding me for platforming people. She doesn't agree with right [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5426.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5431.88s)]
*  Well, I don't like her for a lot of other reasons, too, but I don't think you're a lot nicer than me [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5432.84s)]
*  uh, but yes that so so using that term is like a pejorative [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5437.72s)]
*  As this forbidden thing is that that should be a leftist. I mean that should be one of the quintessential we think about wokeness [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5442.84s)]
*  That's one of the quintessential features of wokeness. Whatever that is exactly [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5449.24s)]
*  Is this idea you want to platform people? Uh, I I just don't agree with it. I mean what is [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5453.72s)]
*  What does that even mean and also [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5460.360000000001s)]
*  Uh, usually when someone is accused of platforming someone else [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5463.88s)]
*  It's like it doesn't even make sense to begin with because the person that they're saying is being platformed already had a platform [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5469.400000000001s)]
*  Like we all have platforms. We're all we're out there saying what we think already [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5475.8s)]
*  So usually when they say platforming what they really mean is [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5480.360000000001s)]
*  You talked to that person [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5483.8s)]
*  It's not that we don't want you to platform that person. They already had a platform [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5485.96s)]
*  We don't want you to speak to that person [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5488.68s)]
*  And have any kind of conversation with them [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5491.320000000001s)]
*  um, but what they're really trying to do is set guardrails around my mind [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5493.8s)]
*  And treat me like a slave a non-human being they're they're trying to tell me you're not allowed to think certain things [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5498.360000000001s)]
*  And I reserve the right. I think it's an absolute right to think whatever I want a [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5503.56s)]
*  B if you disagree with what I think it's incumbent on you to convince me that i'm wrong [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5507.56s)]
*  through reason [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5512.28s)]
*  Like show me the countervailing evidence. It's not enough to say [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5513.96s)]
*  My views are naughty [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5517.8s)]
*  The person i'm talking to is naughty. They're discredited. They're bad [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5519.400000000001s)]
*  I mean that's like a species of religion and a false religion I would say and yet i'm seeing that impuls that [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5523.32s)]
*  That reveals a way of thinking that is totalitarian [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5528.52s)]
*  And low and dumb and embarrassing and that I associate with the left but i'm seeing everywhere on the right like what the [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5531.26s)]
*  I'm trying not to use the f-word. What the heck is going on mount walsh? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5538.22s)]
*  Like if I disagree with you [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5542.860000000001s)]
*  Matt walsh, I would say I disagree with you and here's why right and I would pay you the respect of taking your ideas seriously [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5544.780000000001s)]
*  And trying to dissuade you from those ideas. I would not say how dare you mount walsh think that [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5550.38s)]
*  Because that's insulting not simply to you, but i'm insulting my own intelligence [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5555.820000000001s)]
*  That's how dumb people communicate right? Yeah [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5560.22s)]
*  And and I I believe in free speech in principle so people should [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5563.900000000001s)]
*  And to me free speech is it's not a complicated [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5568.22s)]
*  Idea free speech means that you have the freedom to express whatever opinion or perspective you want [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5572.54s)]
*  I can agree or disagree doesn't matter [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5582.3s)]
*  Now that doesn't extend to things like in my mind hardcore pornography. That's not speech [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5584.9400000000005s)]
*  That's not an opinion that's being expressed. That is digital prostitution [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5589.9s)]
*  But if it's an opinion if you're just sending a message about what you believe you should be able to do that [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5594.54s)]
*  period [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5600.38s)]
*  um [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5601.58s)]
*  So that's the first thing [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5602.7s)]
*  but then also strategically [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5604.38s)]
*  You know when you start complaining about platforming [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5607.18s)]
*  It's just a it's a bad strategy because all you when you point to someone and you say that person shouldn't be platformed [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5609.98s)]
*  Uh all you're doing if you're worried about what that person is saying all you're doing is making people more interested [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5617.18s)]
*  In what that person says, I know i'm that way if I hear [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5623.18s)]
*  That there's a controversy because so-and-so was platformed [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5628.3s)]
*  And i've never heard that person. I immediately say oh, what's this person all about? I gotta look into them [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5632.06s)]
*  Yeah, I always do that [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5635.9800000000005s)]
*  Oh, I take it one step farther and then book the person on the show. Yeah. Yeah always of course [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5637.740000000001s)]
*  Because it's it's like and whatever it is you said that upset upsets people i'm interested because people are so upset [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5642.54s)]
*  I might not agree with it [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5648.38s)]
*  But i'm interested [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5649.900000000001s)]
*  Uh, and I I just reject in principle like if you are telling me that I shouldn't hear that person or talk to them [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5651.820000000001s)]
*  Or take them seriously or listen to their ideas [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5658.9400000000005s)]
*  Just in principle. I want to say no f you i'm just now i'm going to listen even more [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5661.9800000000005s)]
*  You know now i'm going to listen to a two-hour podcast that I would have listened to otherwise just because you said that exactly [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5667.02s)]
*  And especially if you don't explain the person's ideas and why they're wrong [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5672.06s)]
*  I mean, I I think a lot of ideas are wrong and there are a lot of poisonous people out there [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5675.9800000000005s)]
*  Selling crap poisonous crap [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5680.3s)]
*  Um, I completely agree with that. I just think it's important [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5683.18s)]
*  It's essential it should be required to explain why it's wrong. Not just that it's bad [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5686.700000000001s)]
*  What did you think of the debate? A lot of this kind of broke through the surface in the debate [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5691.1s)]
*  between [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5696.700000000001s)]
*  dave smith and [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5697.820000000001s)]
*  Um douglas murray on rogan a couple of weeks ago. Did you watch that and what I did I watched I ended up watching [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5699.9s)]
*  I wasn't planning on watching the whole thing, but I watched the whole thing [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5706.0599999999995s)]
*  Over the course of a few days was a long debate [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5709.98s)]
*  and [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5712.94s)]
*  You know, I have a a different [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5715.9s)]
*  I come in with a different perspective than maybe some people who are really interested in the debate in that I don't have a [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5718.78s)]
*  dog in the fight [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5723.259999999999s)]
*  I don't [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5725.5s)]
*  Everyone is i'm constantly hearing from the peanut gallery demanding that I um [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5728.06s)]
*  Kind of give my my verdict or my take on israel and israel versus palestine and all this kind of stuff [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5734.3s)]
*  And I have given my take and my take is I don't [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5740.54s)]
*  care that much [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5743.42s)]
*  Uh, so I just don't care that much. I'm uh, i'm not just america first [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5744.78s)]
*  I'm i'm an american chauvinist in that I only care about my own country [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5748.78s)]
*  I I honestly don't care about other countries. I wish them well [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5753.26s)]
*  I don't I don't wish any of them. I don't wish them ill [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5756.780000000001s)]
*  I wish the people of other countries. Well, uh, I think they all have a right to defend themselves and they should [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5759.5s)]
*  I think that if you can't defend yourself as a nation or if you can't survive without [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5765.820000000001s)]
*  Um being propped up by another government say ours [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5771.02s)]
*  Then you shouldn't exist as a country. Uh, that's just the way of the world. So wait, wait, wait [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5774.9400000000005s)]
*  If you if you can't exist without being propped up by another government say ours you shouldn't exist [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5780.3s)]
*  Yes, israel cannot exist without being propped up by the united states you think so [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5786.9400000000005s)]
*  Its nuclear program came from the united states its weapons come from the united states its economies supported by the united states [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5792.38s)]
*  I'm not talking israel. I'm just saying in point of fact, I think that's true [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5797.02s)]
*  and [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5800.860000000001s)]
*  I mean israel thinks it's true or they wouldn't have armies of lobbyists and influencers in the united states [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5802.14s)]
*  BB wouldn't have shown up twice in the past three months. Yeah, I mean the way [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5806.38s)]
*  From my perspective it seems like they can handle themselves [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5812.14s)]
*  quite fine [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5815.900000000001s)]
*  But any country if there is any country out there that [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5818.9400000000005s)]
*  Fundamentally cannot exist without being [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5824.120000000001s)]
*  subsidized by american taxpayers [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5828.6s)]
*  Then not only should that country not exist, but that country already does not exist. It's it's not really [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5831.740000000001s)]
*  That's interesting. It's not really a country right now. It's [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5837.820000000001s)]
*  um [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5841.42s)]
*  And unless we want to go back to the old way, which was you know back in in the bad old days [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5842.86s)]
*  When we did real empires [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5848.38s)]
*  you know [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5850.78s)]
*  If you want to just be conquered and and you're going to be a you're going to be a vassal state of ours [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5852.219999999999s)]
*  And we're going to sort of own you [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5858.46s)]
*  Then uh, then that's that's one system, but we don't really do that at least not directly anymore [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5860.46s)]
*  so [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5865.66s)]
*  If if you can I just ask you was that such an interesting not only does it have no right to exist [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5867.82s)]
*  It already doesn't exist. It's not a real country. Yeah, not a real country if any country that that right that's true of yeah [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5872.14s)]
*  Now i'm not convinced at all that that is true of israel. I'm not convinced at all [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5879.660000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't know either by the way, and I think israel seems like a perfectly functional and strong country [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5883.34s)]
*  Including with a strong economy that goes up and down but basically I mean they have a robust tech sector [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5888.700000000001s)]
*  They've got a lot going for them. And so [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5893.660000000001s)]
*  I think I kind of agree. I'm just saying they don't seem to feel that way [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5896.14s)]
*  But who knows what the truth is. I I think that if we were to withdraw I think we should withdraw withdraw all federal all uh, [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5899.1s)]
*  Foreign aid from every country, you know, I I don't think we should be doing it at all [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5906.700000000001s)]
*  I think really yeah, and I think if we did that I think israel would still exist [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5911.1s)]
*  I think I think if we took away all the foreign aid [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5915.660000000001s)]
*  Tomorrow next week two months from now israel would still be I agree with that a country. Yes, there are probably other countries on [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5918.700000000001s)]
*  The planet that just would not exist anymore [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5925.74s)]
*  But countries have to make more realistic decisions when there's no backstop in the same way that people do and in the same way that [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5927.9s)]
*  people on welfare or people with trust funds [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5934.62s)]
*  Equally kind of tend to make terrible decisions about their own lives [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5937.58s)]
*  I think it's also true for countries you get way overextended when you're dependent [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5941.9s)]
*  Yeah, and this is and by the way, this is when I say [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5947.179999999999s)]
*  That a country that can't survive without us shouldn't exist or doesn't exist [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5950.46s)]
*  That's not any kind of like moral judgment [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5954.14s)]
*  it's just [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5956.62s)]
*  this is the way of [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5958.22s)]
*  human civilization you you have to be able to [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5959.9800000000005s)]
*  You have to be able to stand on your own two feet to be to even qualify as a country right [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5965.02s)]
*  And I think the american taxpayers have been saddled for many years now [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5971.34s)]
*  With propping up country after country after country [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5976.22s)]
*  When that that is not a responsibility that should fall to me or you or to my kids [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5979.099999999999s)]
*  Our responsibility is to our is to ourselves and it's also true of us if we could not exist [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5988.219999999999s)]
*  I agree, you know if if if we were depending on [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5993.5s)]
*  Welfare from some other country in order to exist then I would say that like we're not a country anymore [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=5998.299999999999s)]
*  Then I would say that like we're not a country anymore [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6002.94s)]
*  So, you know take it away and like let whatever happens happens [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6006.219999999999s)]
*  Let let the thing fall apart and maybe from the ashes we can build a real country [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6009.0199999999995s)]
*  That would be my take if it was true of us [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6013.099999999999s)]
*  so [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6015.419999999999s)]
*  How did we get [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6016.86s)]
*  um, I I [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6018.86s)]
*  Veemently agree with you. I don't think i've ever heard it as well put [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6020.86s)]
*  um [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6024.54s)]
*  But I don't think anything you said is radical. I think it's as you just said it's the way of human civilization [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6025.5s)]
*  How do we get to a place where that qualifies as a radical view? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6030.860000000001s)]
*  I think it's it's people have been conditioned that um [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6036.3s)]
*  You know xenophobia is a is a is a great sin [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6041.5s)]
*  and [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6046.46s)]
*  So, I don't know. It's this I don't really understand it because i've never felt it [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6047.820000000001s)]
*  But for a lot of people they just feel it feels wrong to them [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6050.860000000001s)]
*  To actually prioritize their own country it feels it I guess it feels unnatural to people which is crazy. It's bizarre [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6055.740000000001s)]
*  because to me it's the most natural thing in the world like I [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6063.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6068.780000000001s)]
*  It should not be controversial to say [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6070.46s)]
*  I care more about my country than I care about anybody else [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6073.58s)]
*  I care more about the people in my country than I care about anyone else [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6076.860000000001s)]
*  And the amount that I sort of care about you [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6081.18s)]
*  It increases the closer you are to me that [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6085.18s)]
*  That's the way people work [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6089.900000000001s)]
*  So I care the most about my own kids [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6092.22s)]
*  I care more about my own kids than [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6094.700000000001s)]
*  Anyone else if my kids are in a fire and someone else is in a fire [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6097.1s)]
*  I'm saving my own kids a thousand times out of a thousand [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6100.62s)]
*  Um, if I had to choose between one of my kids and a thousand other people [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6103.900000000001s)]
*  I'd save my kid [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6108.06s)]
*  over the thousand [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6109.900000000001s)]
*  Because that's that's my you know [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6112.14s)]
*  They're my kids. That's my blood [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6114.9400000000005s)]
*  And and then you know branching out from there [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6117.58s)]
*  I care about my my family my my larger family [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6121.26s)]
*  I care about [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6125.18s)]
*  From there my community [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6126.46s)]
*  Where I live? [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6128.62s)]
*  And then you know, there's a subsidiarity and then and then branching out from there I care about centric circles of obligation exactly [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6131.900000000001s)]
*  And that's that should just be so natural [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6137.9800000000005s)]
*  That's that's how people work and and that's how everyone works like [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6141.58s)]
*  If I told you [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6146.54s)]
*  Anyone who hears this and thinks that it sounds cruel or something [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6149.1s)]
*  Well, if I came to you and told you [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6152.7s)]
*  that [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6155.18s)]
*  Your friend's child died [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6157.18s)]
*  You would be really broken up. I would assume in tears. Yeah, I would be in tears about it [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6160.3s)]
*  if I came to you and said [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6165.98s)]
*  You know just a few minutes ago a child in china was hit by a car and died [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6168.94s)]
*  You would say [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6175.339999999999s)]
*  That's that's too bad [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6176.86s)]
*  It's sad and then you would not think about it again, correct? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6179.179999999999s)]
*  You would move on with your life and never even think about it [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6182.94s)]
*  Even though that's a child. It's a child. The child died. It's a terrible thing. It's really sad [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6185.98s)]
*  objectively that child in china dying [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6191.639999999999s)]
*  objectively is as terrible as [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6194.28s)]
*  Your friend's child dying [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6197.0s)]
*  But your attachment to that child in china is much less [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6198.92s)]
*  Is basically non-existent [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6204.04s)]
*  um [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6206.44s)]
*  Your obligation to that child is the idea is that [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6207.4s)]
*  What you're describing is sentiment sentimentality really? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6211.5599999999995s)]
*  And that it's our job as evolved beings to override that false sentimentality [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6216.36s)]
*  with like a clear [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6222.44s)]
*  Moral code, I don't think it is sentiment. I think it's the opposite [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6224.599999999999s)]
*  I I think the idea that we should you know what I mean? Like, yeah, that's what this is effective altruism. Actually, it's like [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6227.4s)]
*  No that every human life has equal value, which I think you would agree with as a christian. Absolutely [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6233.32s)]
*  Yeah, therefore our obligation to every human being is identical [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6238.839999999999s)]
*  And I and and you're right that they would so what i'm saying they would call false sentimentality, but but that is false sentimentality [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6245.5599999999995s)]
*  Is it because you think your child has more moral worth than anyone else's child? [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6252.22s)]
*  No, is it because your child dying in a fire is objectively more sad? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6256.54s)]
*  Than someone else's child? No [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6262.38s)]
*  But that's your blood. That's not sentiment. That's your blood. That's your family [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6265.1s)]
*  That's your family [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6270.700000000001s)]
*  That's your family [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6273.18s)]
*  That's your family [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6275.820000000001s)]
*  Blood that's not sentiment. That's your blood. That's your family, but that means something but blood doesn't matter snakes aren't real [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6277.9s)]
*  I think it's the most [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6287.98s)]
*  It's one of the most real things there is, you know, and um [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6289.42s)]
*  And and it's obligation, you know, it's it should also be it should be inherent [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6293.34s)]
*  It's instinctual but it's also you have an obligation to your child and then branching out of the concentric circles [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6297.099999999999s)]
*  You have an obligation [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6303.98s)]
*  To your country and you have an attachment you should have an attachment to your country and a pride in your country [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6305.9s)]
*  Um, these are your people this is your history [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6311.259999999999s)]
*  These are your ancestors [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6314.7s)]
*  And [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6319.179999999999s)]
*  And so that's it I mean and to me it's the most it's the most natural thing in the world [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6321.82s)]
*  and um, so nationalism is [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6327.34s)]
*  Is not really an ideology. It's just like [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6330.0599999999995s)]
*  Nature it's just the default position. That's like [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6333.74s)]
*  Yes, it's the natural state of human beings the natural state of it's the natural way that societies are organized [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6336.7s)]
*  That's all national. Why is everyone afraid of it and against it? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6341.82s)]
*  I think it's it's [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6346.139999999999s)]
*  Like a lot of it is confusion not understanding what nationalism even is [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6348.94s)]
*  um [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6355.339999999999s)]
*  It's part of the kind of globalist agenda. It's part of this destructive [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6357.099999999999s)]
*  Like I said a lot of it comes down to destroying the family and [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6361.18s)]
*  And we do that by inverting everybody's priorities. Yeah, so that [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6364.54s)]
*  like they want to get you to the point where you're where you're more concerned about [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6370.780000000001s)]
*  Peace in ukraine than you are about [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6376.62s)]
*  Uh protecting your own child. Well, they've absolutely succeeded by the way they go on social media, which I really try to avoid [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6380.22s)]
*  But whenever I go on it [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6386.7s)]
*  And it's all right wingers or whatever. They are now, but it's all trump voters, right in my feed [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6388.86s)]
*  They're yelling at each other over mostly about israel, but also about ukraine but about foreign countries. That's what they're mad at [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6394.94s)]
*  I mean, they're totally obsessed [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6401.5s)]
*  and by the way, I think it's legitimate to have views on all four i've got a million views on a million different foreign countries [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6404.54s)]
*  including those two but [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6409.179999999999s)]
*  That's their overriding concern. It does seem I hate the word op but it does seem like by design [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6411.5s)]
*  Someone has sapped the vital energy [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6417.339999999999s)]
*  From trump's voting base by convincing them [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6420.139999999999s)]
*  That what's happening in these foreign countries is more important than what's happening in their own. That's what I [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6423.339999999999s)]
*  See, do you see this? I do see it and uh, and and I don't [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6427.98s)]
*  I don't understand it. I don't understand why [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6433.42s)]
*  How do we get to a point where [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6437.58s)]
*  The the dominant conversation in this country [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6441.179999999999s)]
*  Is about what's happening in other countries I don't I don't understand it [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6444.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't understand the people that are obsessively focused on it on either side of it really. I agree [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6449.34s)]
*  um [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6454.780000000001s)]
*  because [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6456.46s)]
*  And can I say america's role in the world? [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6457.66s)]
*  Is a different question like we play a role in the world. We certainly have [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6461.02s)]
*  What's the appropriate role? [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6465.740000000001s)]
*  Is a question that americans should be concerned with because it's our money in the lives of our [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6467.820000000001s)]
*  young men, so [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6472.7s)]
*  But this is something different you're saying people's like [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6474.14s)]
*  Obsession about a foreign conflict between two like foreign actors [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6477.08s)]
*  Is that what you're saying or I don't want to put words in your mouth. Yeah. Yeah obsession with a conflict [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6481.660000000001s)]
*  Taking any foreign country and making it the centerpiece of our political debates makes no sense to me [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6489.1s)]
*  And and I think people on either side do that my sense right when I go on twitter [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6498.780000000001s)]
*  going x [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6504.780000000001s)]
*  and [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6506.780000000001s)]
*  No matter what the topic is it seems it's like, you know used to be six degrees of kevin bacon or whatever. Yeah [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6508.62s)]
*  uh [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6514.46s)]
*  Now it's two degrees of israel. I was like no matter what the topic is [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6515.5s)]
*  It always comes back for a lot of people to israel one way or another [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6518.860000000001s)]
*  and um [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6522.54s)]
*  That's not how I see it. I don't see israel as the as the the the centerpiece of any of these debates [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6524.780000000001s)]
*  At all does seem like it's blowing or blowing up is probably too strong, but it's definitely dividing [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6531.02s)]
*  The you know trump's voter base [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6537.42s)]
*  Big time [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6539.58s)]
*  Do you feel that? [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6540.62s)]
*  I do and it's a shame [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6542.22s)]
*  Because why are we being divided over that? [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6544.06s)]
*  of all things let's be divided over fentanyl or [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6546.62s)]
*  Yeah, tariffs or whatever something [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6549.5s)]
*  You know what I mean? Yeah, so that's going going all the way back to what actually your question that I never answered [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6551.900000000001s)]
*  I don't think I gave you a chance. I was often so I was I was also off [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6557.900000000001s)]
*  Uh, but about the the dave smith and douglas murray debate [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6561.66s)]
*  My point was i'm going into it. I don't really have a dog in the fight [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6566.38s)]
*  I don't know why these guys either and uh, I don't know either of the guys. I'm I don't really [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6569.26s)]
*  I'm not following the issue that closely. I'm just not [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6573.900000000001s)]
*  I'm focused on america [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6577.34s)]
*  and so i'm [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6579.900000000001s)]
*  I'm really just interested to see how this turns out. I you know, i'm i'm listening to both arguments [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6582.06s)]
*  and [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6587.66s)]
*  I thought that um [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6589.5s)]
*  Douglas murray who seems like a really smart guy [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6592.3s)]
*  I thought he made a crucial mistake in the debate [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6596.06s)]
*  By starting it seemed like the first 45 minutes to an hour was this [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6600.62s)]
*  kind of this [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6605.18s)]
*  Litigation over who's an expert and who isn't [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6606.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's just not you're not going to win the argument that way nobody wants to hear it [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6610.22s)]
*  Nobody should want to hear it [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6614.22s)]
*  Credentialism [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6616.280000000001s)]
*  You're not an expert [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6617.820000000001s)]
*  you know [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6619.820000000001s)]
*  We've seen what the expert class has [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6621.02s)]
*  Given us especially over the last five years pretty good job or no [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6624.46s)]
*  I'd give it a [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6628.14s)]
*  Solid d minus. Yeah, it's very generous very generous [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6629.42s)]
*  Uh, so nobody wants to hear it nobody wants to hear about about um [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6634.54s)]
*  Calling yourself an expert goes back again to words that don't mean anything anymore. Yeah [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6639.1s)]
*  That's a word that should mean something it should it is possible expertise is a real thing [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6643.5s)]
*  There are people who can be experts [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6649.5s)]
*  on [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6651.82s)]
*  a subject [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6652.94s)]
*  I would hope that the pilot of my plane [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6654.139999999999s)]
*  Is an expert in flying a plane [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6657.42s)]
*  um [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6659.66s)]
*  As we've seen we can't we can't rely on that being the case either anymore [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6661.0199999999995s)]
*  But that's what it should mean [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6665.099999999999s)]
*  But we've also used the word expert [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6667.26s)]
*  And applied it to people who are making outrageously false claims [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6669.900000000001s)]
*  I mean the experts are the ones who told us that [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6675.02s)]
*  You know, you can castrate your son and turn him into a girl [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6678.14s)]
*  But that was the expert opinion. That was the opinion of the expert class [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6680.54s)]
*  for years [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6684.860000000001s)]
*  and and [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6686.38s)]
*  Still is with some of them [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6688.22s)]
*  So in a world like that in a world where the experts are telling us that women have penises and men can have babies [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6690.46s)]
*  The word expert just doesn't mean anything anymore [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6697.26s)]
*  It should but it doesn't [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6700.38s)]
*  Which means that if you're going to have this conversation skip past that we don't need like we don't need to [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6702.46s)]
*  Litigate what an expert is or who an expert is you want to begin with the merits of the debate, right? [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6707.74s)]
*  Just just get into it. It doesn't matter this guy that you're sitting next to [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6712.06s)]
*  Whether he's an expert or not [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6715.58s)]
*  Makes no difference. I don't care if he's a [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6717.900000000001s)]
*  Scholar, I don't care if he's a homeless guy. You just pulled off the street [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6720.9400000000005s)]
*  His arguments are valid or they aren't [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6723.66s)]
*  Exactly, and that's all that matters. That's all that anyone cares about so this went on for an hour [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6727.82s)]
*  Yeah, that's i'd say the first hour was was about who was an expert and who isn't is that I mean douglas burry is [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6734.06s)]
*  famous for being smart [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6739.58s)]
*  What do you think that was? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6741.82s)]
*  I don't know. I I honestly don't I thought it was a just a strategic error [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6743.98s)]
*  um a pretty serious one [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6748.7s)]
*  and then [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6751.66s)]
*  By the time you actually get into the debate then a lot of people have just kind of [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6753.58s)]
*  Checked out because it comes off as kind of snobbish [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6757.58s)]
*  um [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6760.46s)]
*  And it comes off as you know, it's credentialism as as you're trying to [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6763.1s)]
*  Invalidate the argument before it's even presented [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6767.72s)]
*  So that that was the mistake then when they actually got into the actual conversation I found it to be I just thought it was interesting [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6773.9s)]
*  I really did and I thought they both made [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6779.66s)]
*  Valid points they both know more about the subject than I do a lot more that was very clear to me [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6782.62s)]
*  um [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6787.82s)]
*  And I I think if you could chop off the first hour of the debate [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6789.98s)]
*  It was an interesting conversation [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6793.98s)]
*  Who do you think made a more compelling case on the once they actually got down to the question at hand? [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6796.7s)]
*  I don't know. I think that [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6812.0599999999995s)]
*  So douglas murray said one thing he made one point that I thought was was really good [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6814.38s)]
*  It was just a simple one. I like simple points me too [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6820.3s)]
*  and [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6824.139999999999s)]
*  At one point he asked dave [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6825.9s)]
*  Because once they got into arguing about [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6828.46s)]
*  What happened after october 7th how israel responded? [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6830.78s)]
*  And dave has all of his criticisms about what israel has done [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6834.86s)]
*  And then douglas murray said uh said well what what would you what would you have them do? [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6839.179999999999s)]
*  Now what what would you prefer to have for them to have done? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6846.7s)]
*  If they want to rescue the hostages and also [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6850.46s)]
*  destroy hamas [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6853.82s)]
*  What do you want them to do instead? [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6856.0599999999995s)]
*  And then from what I remember dave [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6859.0199999999995s)]
*  He pointed out that okay destroying hamas and rescuing hostages are kind of are not necessarily the same objective [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6861.66s)]
*  Uh, and then they started talking about rescuing hostages [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6867.9800000000005s)]
*  They didn't really circle back to the destroying hamas part [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6871.1s)]
*  And I would have liked to see him stick on that point [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6874.620000000001s)]
*  Like get an answer. Well, so so if you're israel you have a foreign [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6878.620000000001s)]
*  You know these these foreign enemy that's come into your country [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6883.740000000001s)]
*  Uh slaughtered hundreds of people [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6887.580000000001s)]
*  What should how should you respond to that [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6892.22s)]
*  Um [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6895.02s)]
*  And I think he should have uh, he should have pressed that and he and he didn't and so it became it was sort of unfocused [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6896.22s)]
*  Because I would have I would have legitimately liked to hear the answer to that [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6903.66s)]
*  For sure [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6907.26s)]
*  What what would you have them do? [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6908.22s)]
*  So we could talk about maybe there are other ways to rescue the hostages [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6910.06s)]
*  But do you think they should try to destroy hamas? [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6913.34s)]
*  Given what happened? [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6916.7s)]
*  And if you do [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6918.54s)]
*  How else should they go about it? [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6920.62s)]
*  Um [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6923.5s)]
*  But they kind of moved on to other things and it became this kind of it became a sort of unfocused [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6925.34s)]
*  In my mind sort of like circular conversation [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6929.9s)]
*  As these debates tend to devolve into very often [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6933.0199999999995s)]
*  If you were in control of what people on twitter debated, what would they be debating right now? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6936.14s)]
*  Everything we talked about for the first, you know hour of this conversation is what [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6945.74s)]
*  Like let's talk about the war on the family. Yeah on marriage [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6950.62s)]
*  Things that affect our kids [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6957.26s)]
*  You know [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6959.9s)]
*  How do we how do we raise healthy happy kids? Let's talk about that [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6961.82s)]
*  Any of these issues is like serious deep cultural issues in our country. Yes is what we should be talking about in my mind [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6966.22s)]
*  You feel like it's very hard to go from affluence to less affluence. It's very hard to move backward [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6975.58s)]
*  It's like hard for the human brain to deal with it, but it's possible [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6981.18s)]
*  um [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6984.78s)]
*  You feel like the united states could become [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6986.22s)]
*  Significantly poor not poor but less rich than it is now [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6989.0s)]
*  And still remain cohesive and happy [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6993.5s)]
*  people with meaningful lives who love their neighbors and their spouses and their children, but [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=6996.86s)]
*  You you're not going to do that without families [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7002.139999999999s)]
*  You can't do that if people are living in studio apartments by themselves with their cats like that's just not going to happen, right? [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7006.62s)]
*  Right [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7012.139999999999s)]
*  So I just think objectively that's the most important issue [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7013.099999999999s)]
*  Why isn't it the topic of discussion or debate? [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7017.099999999999s)]
*  And why did the republican party shunt aside social conservatives like circus freaks for 40 years? Like what was that? [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7021.099999999999s)]
*  Uh [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7028.78s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people invested in it not being the topic of conversation because once you start talking about it [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7030.78s)]
*  You start noticing things [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7035.74s)]
*  That they don't want you to notice [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7037.66s)]
*  Well, you start noticing who the [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7040.94s)]
*  You know this the the [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7043.5s)]
*  The actual agenda to destroy the family to destroy marriage [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7045.5s)]
*  uh, you start you start noticing that [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7049.179999999999s)]
*  You know we we veered off [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7054.86s)]
*  Took kind of a left turn veer off away from the way civilization was structured for thousands of years. It hasn't really worked out [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7057.099999999999s)]
*  um [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7065.9s)]
*  You start looking at any of these things and you say okay [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7067.339999999999s)]
*  Well, we started making all these changes all these reforms all this supposed progress [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7069.82s)]
*  Uh, and a lot of the these wheels have been in motion for decades [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7075.179999999999s)]
*  How has it worked out [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7080.54s)]
*  You know, what what's what what's by its fruits? You shall know it. So how has it worked out? [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7082.219999999999s)]
*  None of it has worked out [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7087.82s)]
*  um [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7090.219999999999s)]
*  And I think you notice that and and I think there are people who don't want you to and also [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7092.299999999999s)]
*  Some of these social issues when you're talking about families and these kinds of things [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7096.86s)]
*  It hits closer to home. That's for sure [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7101.099999999999s)]
*  As it should more than tax rates you could hurt people's feelings. Yeah, it hurts it's closer to home [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7103.82s)]
*  And so people feel [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7108.139999999999s)]
*  Everyone has they have their own hang-ups. They have their own sensitivities [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7109.66s)]
*  They have maybe mistakes they feel they've made in their own families their own marriages with their own kids and [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7112.879999999999s)]
*  They feel indicted [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7118.08s)]
*  I think [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7119.759999999999s)]
*  So I think for some people it just feels it's safer to talk about issues that are 10 000 miles away [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7121.759999999999s)]
*  um [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7128.16s)]
*  Do you ever get I mean there are [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7129.36s)]
*  plenty of conservative so-called influencers who [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7132.24s)]
*  You know have personal lives that are what you're describing as bad [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7136.24s)]
*  Do they ever call you and say hey matt walsh you hurt my feelings [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7139.6s)]
*  Uh certainly don't call me. No, they don't call me to say it but [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7144.16s)]
*  Plenty of conservative influencers quote unquote will [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7151.92s)]
*  You know, they'll all say something they'll send out a tweet. They'll attack me publicly [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7155.28s)]
*  So I much prefer the call I much prefer the [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7160.08s)]
*  It's not hard to get my number if you're in the you know business or send me a message or something [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7163.76s)]
*  But people don't generally do that. That's not how people operate [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7168.320000000001s)]
*  Have you noticed that like a huge percentage of war-crazed republican senators are secretly gay? What is that? [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7171.68s)]
*  Uh [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7180.08s)]
*  Are they yeah [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7181.4400000000005s)]
*  Like what is that? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7183.360000000001s)]
*  What is the connection between which are the ones that are secretly gay? I don't know that the ones who are secret about it. Um [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7185.6s)]
*  But there is some kind of there I guess all i'm saying i'm not being catty [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7192.320000000001s)]
*  I'm trying not to be catty or cruel or whatever [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7195.68s)]
*  But I do think there's a connection to the way that you live at home [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7198.400000000001s)]
*  Connection between the way you live at home and like the policies that you espouse and the impulses that you have and like [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7203.04s)]
*  The vision that you have for the country you lead [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7208.72s)]
*  Like I don't I don't really know if you want a people with like truly unsettled dark personal lives with power [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7211.68s)]
*  Do you no? I mean I I [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7219.200000000001s)]
*  I [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7222.48s)]
*  Even outside of the people running the country I um [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7223.68s)]
*  I automatically have [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7228.08s)]
*  at least some semblance of respect for a man if [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7230.16s)]
*  You know, he's a good husband and a good father [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7233.84s)]
*  And you can't always tell that but I think often you can [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7236.32s)]
*  And those are the kinds of people I want to surround myself with I don't want to be around people who aren't [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7240.24s)]
*  um [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7244.96s)]
*  People have disordered personal lives. I don't I don't really want to be around them [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7245.92s)]
*  So if I don't want to be around them, I don't want them running the country fair [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7249.5199999999995s)]
*  Last question broad question 100 days into trump. How's it going? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7253.5199999999995s)]
*  Are you are you happy with it? I assume you vote you voted for donald trump. Yeah. Yeah [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7258.72s)]
*  um [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7263.76s)]
*  I mean has it been what you expected? [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7265.28s)]
*  It it [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7268.639999999999s)]
*  In some ways it's been better than I expected in some significant ways [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7270.16s)]
*  I I think that my number one criticism of trump in his first term [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7275.04s)]
*  Was despite all the talk about how he's a fascist dictator [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7279.44s)]
*  In reality in his first term it seemed to me he was very [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7283.679999999999s)]
*  Shy about wielding his power and his authority [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7287.12s)]
*  um [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7290.24s)]
*  He seemed to be [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7291.44s)]
*  A lot more worried about what people say about him what the media says about him [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7292.96s)]
*  A lot more focused on the coverage and all that sort of thing [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7296.8s)]
*  And this time around that doesn't seem to be the case, you know and jumping in with [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7300.16s)]
*  2000 executive orders or whatever it was dozens [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7304.639999999999s)]
*  um [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7308.16s)]
*  Touching on some real hot button controversial issues. What was your favorite? [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7309.599999999999s)]
*  uh [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7315.12s)]
*  Well, I mean as someone who's been really invested in this issue all the there's several executive orders, uh dealing with [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7316.96s)]
*  gender ideology, I mean even something as simple as [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7324.24s)]
*  illegally defining [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7327.0199999999995s)]
*  What a man or woman is we shouldn't have to do that, but we did and he did [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7328.72s)]
*  Um [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7334.96s)]
*  Prohibiting to the extent that it's possible from his position the castration [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7336.48s)]
*  mutilation of children [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7341.28s)]
*  now congress has to [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7343.839999999999s)]
*  Follow up with these executive orders and codify them into law which hasn't happened with [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7346.08s)]
*  I don't think any of them [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7351.759999999999s)]
*  Which I am worried about because the thing about an executive order is that when the next guy gets in there [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7353.919999999999s)]
*  If he's a democrat, he can just he can undo that as quickly as it was done. So [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7357.839999999999s)]
*  Uh, that's that's uh, it's a band-aid. It's not the permanent solution [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7362.879999999999s)]
*  um [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7367.28s)]
*  Why hasn't [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7369.28s)]
*  Why hasn't there been a law yet passed by congress? [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7370.959999999999s)]
*  Federally banning the mutilation and castration of children because they're for it [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7375.259999999999s)]
*  For it or they or they don't [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7381.599999999999s)]
*  Care that much [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7384.08s)]
*  Same thing [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7385.5199999999995s)]
*  You know same thing I think I mean if you you're in a position to stop something [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7386.799999999999s)]
*  It's not that hard and you don't I think it's fair to assume you approve of that thing [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7390.5599999999995s)]
*  You yeah, you approve of it or you just don't you don't you don't it's [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7396.719999999999s)]
*  You don't care enough to try to stop it, which effectively it's it's one in the same [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7400.5599999999995s)]
*  um [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7405.36s)]
*  So I all that was good. I liked all that [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7407.28s)]
*  And I think that he's using his power as authority [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7410.719999999999s)]
*  He's not he's not he's not afraid to do that this time around which I think is really good [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7413.599999999999s)]
*  if there's one major [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7418.32s)]
*  criticism or or um [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7420.7s)]
*  Area for improvement it's you know, I don't know what the deportation numbers are exactly [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7422.94s)]
*  I think they should [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7428.94s)]
*  Probably be a lot higher [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7430.94s)]
*  Easier said than done, of course [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7433.5s)]
*  and also we have to [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7436.22s)]
*  I acknowledge that [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7438.139999999999s)]
*  There are fewer people coming in now [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7440.22s)]
*  You know, which is going to bring your deportation numbers down [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7442.86s)]
*  But I think that should be a lot higher and and I think I think that [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7446.22s)]
*  I understand politically focusing on illegal aliens who have committed heinous crimes. We should focus on them [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7449.18s)]
*  But not just them [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7457.820000000001s)]
*  I mean we should be deporting [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7459.58s)]
*  Anyone who's in this country is not supposed to be here [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7462.22s)]
*  You know, I don't care if you had a speeding ticket or [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7465.740000000001s)]
*  A dui or a manslaughter charge [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7468.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, I care that's a big difference but in any of those cases or if you had nothing [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7471.58s)]
*  You shouldn't be in the country then [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7476.780000000001s)]
*  But there are plenty of people the majority I would say of people in washington are arguing the opposite which is like [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7479.0199999999995s)]
*  You know, it doesn't matter that they're breaking the law [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7484.139999999999s)]
*  That's what they're arguing. In fact, they should be protected as they break the law [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7486.7s)]
*  So why are you following laws? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7490.38s)]
*  As someone who was born here paying all the taxes for all this stuff like are you following the law? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7492.7s)]
*  As far as you know, I am yeah [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7498.219999999999s)]
*  Text your wife and find out. Um, I hope not because you'd be an idiot to do that. Wouldn't you? [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7501.98s)]
*  Yeah, well well except that of course I realized that this this you know [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7507.42s)]
*  Get out of jail free card is doesn't is not does not apply to everybody [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7511.42s)]
*  And but do you feel like a fool like you're propping up a system? [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7514.94s)]
*  With at least half of the money you make every year at least half more than half if you total it all up [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7519.82s)]
*  even in tennessee [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7525.34s)]
*  and you're paying for a system in which [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7527.34s)]
*  Like you're the it's only downside for you [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7530.94s)]
*  Yeah [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7533.1s)]
*  And it's upside for people who are mocking the laws that you pay to enforce. I don't like [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7534.3s)]
*  Do you feel like a foolish? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7540.06s)]
*  Yeah, you feel like a sucker. But also what's the what's the alternative because if I were to say well [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7541.900000000001s)]
*  Hey, if they don't have to follow the law, then neither do I [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7546.22s)]
*  Well really quickly the system will come along and disabuse me of the notion that this is a this is that you have as many [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7549.58s)]
*  Rights as a asian is there legally? Yeah, exactly because I don't [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7555.58s)]
*  So that won't apply to me especially as a you know as a dreaded white man, so [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7560.06s)]
*  Uh [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7564.620000000001s)]
*  So we're kind of left with no choice [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7565.900000000001s)]
*  I'm only throwing it out there because you said you were becoming much more radical and i'm trying to accelerate the process by pointing out [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7568.46s)]
*  Some things that I want you to think about I appreciate that [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7573.26s)]
*  It'd be hard to accelerate it at this point [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7577.42s)]
*  I love it. There's a forest fire of truth within you [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7581.58s)]
*  Matt walsh, thank you for submitting to all this that was I really enjoyed it appreciate it. Thank you [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7584.620000000001s)]
*  So it turns out that youtube is suppressing this show on one level that's not surprising that's what they do [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7593.5s)]
*  But on another level it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right now all the change taking place in our economy [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7599.18s)]
*  And our politics with the wars won the cusp of fighting right now [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7605.42s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7609.42s)]

*  What can you do about it? [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7617.2s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7618.8s)]
*  We're not in charge of google or we could find a way around it a way that you could actually get information that is true [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIsJaGivBkE&t=7621.280000000001s)]
