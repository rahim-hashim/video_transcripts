# Why the Intel Agencies Want to Track Your Every Transaction and Throw Roger Ver in Jail for Life
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4)
*  Roger, thanks a lot for joining us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=0.0s)]
*  So here's how I understood your story. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2.64s)]
*  This is what I read. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=5.8s)]
*  You are being extradited from Spain, an ally in Western Europe, a NATO country, to the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=7.32s)]
*  United States by the US Justice Department to face life in prison, 109 years, for tax [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=12.68s)]
*  evasion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=19.2s)]
*  You're not a US citizen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=20.82s)]
*  The period that you're being charged with evading American taxes, you are not a US citizen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=22.32s)]
*  And so whenever I see a story that says the US government is extraditing somebody for [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=28.56s)]
*  tax evasion to put him in prison for 109 years, my first thought is, maybe it's not really [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=32.72s)]
*  about the taxes. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=38.96s)]
*  Maybe there's something more to this story. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=40.26s)]
*  Could there be another reason the US government is angry at you and wants to put you in prison [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=42.6s)]
*  for the rest of your life? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=47.04s)]
*  Yeah, to be honest, I think they're not really angry about taxes at all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=48.28s)]
*  I think they're just angry about my lack of obedience and lack of kissing their ring. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=51.32s)]
*  I was the first person in the entire world to start investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=57.54s)]
*  and investing in businesses that made it easy for people to use Bitcoin as money and as [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=60.8s)]
*  cash for people all over the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=64.92s)]
*  And I was promoting it since 2011 as, hey, stop using the US dollar, stop using euro, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=66.94s)]
*  stop using yen, start using Bitcoin. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=71.26s)]
*  We have an alternative in which each individual anywhere on the planet can be in charge of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=73.14s)]
*  their own money completely without needing permission from any politician or any government [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=76.42s)]
*  anywhere in the world. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=79.92s)]
*  And when you're a government that loves controlling people through the control of the money supply, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=81.34s)]
*  that's very, very threatening to their control of the world. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=84.94s)]
*  So of course, they didn't like that at all. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=87.54s)]
*  And I knew that this sort of thing was dangerous. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  And I thought the safest path for me would be to not be a US citizen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=91.38s)]
*  So in 2014, I renounced my US citizenship and became a citizen of the world effectively. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=95.14s)]
*  But my new nationality is St. Kitts, which is a wonderful little island in the Caribbean. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=101.38s)]
*  And I thought that that would be safe for me. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  And I could promote Bitcoin from there and obey. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=108.4s)]
*  Even though I may disagree with plenty of laws, I do my best to obey them because I [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=111.46000000000001s)]
*  know when you're advocating for things that change the world, governments don't like [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=114.36s)]
*  that and they can come after you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=119.4s)]
*  So I told all my tax attorneys and everybody else, we have to do everything perfect so [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=120.4s)]
*  that there's no room for the US government to give me a hard time about any of this. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=124.24s)]
*  And more than a decade after I had already renounced my US citizenship, and just a couple [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=127.32s)]
*  of weeks after I published a book on the hijacking of Bitcoin, how it no longer works as peer [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=131.84s)]
*  to peer cash for the world, and it's been morphed into something that is just a digital [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=135.92s)]
*  asset that people are speculating on the price on rather than something that can compete [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=140.24s)]
*  with the US dollar in the euro in the end for use as currency around the world. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=143.56s)]
*  Suddenly, right after my book gets published, it exposes how people claiming to work for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=147.4s)]
*  intelligence agencies hijack Bitcoin to do that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=151.16000000000003s)]
*  Suddenly, I get arrested and tossed in jail in Spain and trying to be extradited to face [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=154.12s)]
*  more than 100 years in prison. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=158.88s)]
*  I'm 45 today. I think my odds of being alive with conventional technology in 109 [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=161.08s)]
*  years from now aren't looking too good. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  So effectively to die in prison is what they want because they're so upset about the [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=168.04000000000002s)]
*  things I've been saying and the way I've been promoting cryptocurrency around the world [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=171.79999999999998s)]
*  as the founder of Bitcoin.com, co-founder of XRP and Blockchain.com and a bunch of other [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  companies. I literally seeded the entire first generation of cryptocurrency companies. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  And so they're furious at me for trying to have something that can compete with the US [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=183.48s)]
*  dollar as the world's medium of exchange and currency. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=187.44s)]
*  Now, I should just add an editorial comment. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=191.64s)]
*  I mean, I am an American citizen and will remain one, I hope. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=193.84s)]
*  So I'm not against the US dollar in principle. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=199.28s)]
*  It's the mismanagement of the US dollar, I think, by the people in charge of it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=202.04s)]
*  The US government, the Federal Reserve has made it kind of a sketchy proposition long [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=206.95999999999998s)]
*  term. It's like their mismanagement has forced people to think about alternatives. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=212.48s)]
*  And one of the most promising alternatives was Bitcoin. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=216.64s)]
*  And it was, I remember very well since I'm 55, when it first appeared, the idea was this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=221.16s)]
*  is a way for people to conduct business, to buy goods and services without being controlled, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=227.32s)]
*  to have, as you said, control over their own money, autonomy. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=233.32s)]
*  And it has become instead this asset class. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=236.28s)]
*  And I'm very interested in how exactly that happened. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=239.0s)]
*  And so if you wouldn't mind explaining the thesis of your book, what you saw, how that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=241.72s)]
*  happened, you say subterfuge by the intelligence agencies played a role. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=247.8s)]
*  I'll stop talking and let you explain what you saw. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=252.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think to get started on that, we'll have to back up more than 25 years ago. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=255.56s)]
*  So when I was a very young man, I ran for political office as a libertarian in California [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=260.04s)]
*  and called for lower taxes, less government in every area and everywhere. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=265.08s)]
*  And this was in the year 2000. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=269.72s)]
*  And for those of us that are old enough to remember, in the late 1990s, there was an [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=271.4s)]
*  incident in Waco, Texas, where there's a religious group there with a bunch of adults, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=275.72s)]
*  but a bunch of kids, some of them three, four, five years old, like little kids. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=280.44s)]
*  Even if the parents were religious nuts, the ATF and FBI literally burnt to death everybody [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  in their home there and then posed for photos on top of the corpses of little kids. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  And that sort of thing is not okay. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=296.44s)]
*  And the FBI and ATF are a bunch of murderers for murdering kids. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=298.44s)]
*  And even if the parents are doing something illegal, you don't murder the kids over that. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=301.64s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  And so in the debate with the Republican and Democratic candidates, I called the ATF a [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=307.48s)]
*  bunch of murderers that they are for having done that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=311.56s)]
*  And boy, did they not like that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=314.68s)]
*  I was a 20, 21-year-old kid that had seven or eight employees. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=316.2s)]
*  My business was starting to take off. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=319.56s)]
*  And I wound up being the only person in the entire world to be prosecuted for selling [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=321.32s)]
*  the firecracker on eBay, even though tons of other resellers were selling it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=325.72s)]
*  Cabela's Sporting Goods Catalog was selling it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=329.08s)]
*  These were being sold all over the place. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=331.08s)]
*  I was literally the only person in the entire history of the world to be prosecuted [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=332.36s)]
*  for selling those without a permit. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=335.8s)]
*  And it wasn't about the fact that I sold them without a permit. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=337.88s)]
*  They were mad about the things that I had said. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=341.24s)]
*  And they even said as much in one of the discussions with my attorneys and the prosecutors [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=343.24s)]
*  and the ATF agents. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=347.64s)]
*  The ATF agent literally went, he pounded his hand on the table and said, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=348.68s)]
*  you didn't hear the things that he said, referring to me calling them murderers for literal. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=351.48s)]
*  I mean, if you burn to death a bunch of kids, you're a murderer. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=355.32s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=358.68s)]
*  And so I wound up actually signing a plea deal to do 10 months in federal prison. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=360.12s)]
*  If I had taken it to trial and loss, which I would have because I was guilty of the laws [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=364.92s)]
*  written, I sold firecrackers without a license. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=368.44s)]
*  I would have done seven or eight years in prison. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  And so at that point, I no longer felt safe in the US. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=374.44s)]
*  I had been politically persecuted already. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=377.16s)]
*  And so literally the day I was allowed to leave the US, I left. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=379.72s)]
*  But the way I became a libertarian, I wasn't born a libertarian. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=383.32s)]
*  I started, somehow I found a book by Ludwig von Mises and then found some Milton Friedman [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=386.12s)]
*  and then later David Friedman and then Murray Rothbard is the author that really changed [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=391.32s)]
*  my life and was just music to my ears recently hearing a melee down in Argentina talking [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=394.76s)]
*  about how Murray Rothbard was also one of the economists that influenced his life the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=399.24s)]
*  most. And I want to urge anybody, pick up anything by Murray Rothbard. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=403.32s)]
*  It'll change your entire view of the world. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=406.68s)]
*  But in these books on economics, I learned about the origin of money and how something [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  comes to be used as money. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=412.6s)]
*  And it has to be durable, easily divisible. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=413.72s)]
*  It has to be portable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=416.36s)]
*  It has to be easily recognizable. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=418.36s)]
*  It has to be difficult to counterfeit. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=419.64s)]
*  It has to have these certain characteristics that make it usable as money. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=420.84000000000003s)]
*  And so I read these economics books. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=423.88s)]
*  I thought, okay, that makes sense. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=425.48s)]
*  That sounds plausible. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=427.16s)]
*  But then when I went to federal prison, inside prison, everybody's using things as money. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=428.68s)]
*  Everybody's buying and selling things with each other. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=433.64s)]
*  And the things they're using are tobacco, postage stamps, and top ramen soups. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=435.32s)]
*  And if you think about it, all those things have those characteristics. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=439.96s)]
*  They're easily transportable. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=442.36s)]
*  They're durable. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=443.48s)]
*  They're easily recognizable. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=444.36s)]
*  They all have some additional use case, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=445.8s)]
*  You can mail a letter. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=447.56s)]
*  You can eat the soup. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=448.28000000000003s)]
*  You can smoke the tobacco. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=449.0s)]
*  And all those things just naturally without any order from a guard or any inmate or anybody, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=450.52s)]
*  they just naturally come to be used as money. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=454.6s)]
*  And so then we fast forward more than a decade later there, Bitcoin came along. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=457.08s)]
*  And I had the theoretical knowledge from the books that I had read. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=463.24s)]
*  And I had the practical experience from my time in prison. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=467.0s)]
*  There was no doubt in my mind whatsoever that people were going to start using Bitcoin as money. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=469.64s)]
*  And so I thought, oh, this is every libertarian's dream come true. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=474.92s)]
*  Suddenly now we're going to have a choice. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=477.48s)]
*  And I'm not against the US dollar or the yen or the euro. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=479.0s)]
*  I'm pro-choice. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=482.04s)]
*  I think people should be able to choose what form of money they want to use [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=483.08s)]
*  whether it's the dollar, the euro, the yen or Bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency out there. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=486.12s)]
*  I think people deserve the right to have that choice. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=490.04s)]
*  And I want to see that enabled. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=492.6s)]
*  And so when Bitcoin came along, the first step was for me to buy a bunch of Bitcoin. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=494.92s)]
*  I bought my first Bitcoin when they were less than a dollar each. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=498.6s)]
*  And then my business, memorydealers.com, became the first established business in the entire world [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=501.32s)]
*  to start accepting Bitcoin for payments. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=505.8s)]
*  And we started advertising. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=507.48s)]
*  We accept Bitcoin. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=508.68s)]
*  Not a single customer paid us initially in Bitcoin, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=509.8s)]
*  but it got worldwide media attention for the first time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=512.12s)]
*  And I remember it was in June of 2011. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=515.1600000000001s)]
*  And in the course of two, maybe three weeks, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=518.6800000000001s)]
*  the price of Bitcoin went from around $3 a Bitcoin to $30 a Bitcoin. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=520.44s)]
*  And that was the first time in the history of Bitcoin up to that point [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=524.76s)]
*  in which it started to get some worldwide media attention. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=528.2s)]
*  And what an interesting thing happened. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=531.08s)]
*  So the main discussion forum where everybody up to that point was talking about Bitcoin [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=533.72s)]
*  was a website called BitcoinTalk.org. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=537.0s)]
*  And suddenly when it was getting some media attention around the world [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=539.4000000000001s)]
*  and international newspapers, this forum that had worked wonderfully up to that point [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=541.88s)]
*  where people could discuss things became flooded with bots, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=545.8s)]
*  just posting comments that were just fluff and made literally, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=548.6s)]
*  they DDoS the forum to the point that it was unusable. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=552.2s)]
*  And anybody that came there, because they heard about Bitcoin in the media that week, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=555.24s)]
*  they weren't able to learn about it because there's just so many posts saying, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=559.0s)]
*  buy, sell, oh no, and just saying nothing of any substance whatsoever. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=562.04s)]
*  So somebody out there literally made the forum unusable as early as 2011. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=566.6s)]
*  And around that same time, we already know that the CIA was interested in Bitcoin [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=572.4399999999999s)]
*  because they're asking different Bitcoin developers to, hey, can you explain Bitcoin to us? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=575.88s)]
*  So way back when the vast majority of the world hadn't even heard of Bitcoin yet, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=579.48s)]
*  the CIA was looking into it and somebody was actively preventing it from spreading [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=583.16s)]
*  as quickly as it otherwise could have by shutting down the forum effectively [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=586.92s)]
*  when so many new people were coming to Bitcoin to learn about it for the first time. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=590.12s)]
*  And in the early days, everybody knew though, Bitcoin was supposed to be money for the world. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=593.0s)]
*  Bitcoin was supposed to be used for payments as peer-to-peer cash for the world. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=597.96s)]
*  And that's how people were using it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=601.24s)]
*  And I was doing payroll on it and I was paying my suppliers overseas. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=602.52s)]
*  I hosted the first Bitcoin meetup ever in China about it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=605.88s)]
*  I was really doing my best to spread this all over the world, including paying for national [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=608.76s)]
*  radio ads for it. It was really, really spreading. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=613.08s)]
*  But then later, in I believe 2012, a person using the name John Dylan, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=616.52s)]
*  who claimed to work for intelligence, spent more than $10,000. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=622.68s)]
*  I forget the exact amount, but a significant sum of money to start producing propaganda [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=627.4s)]
*  to trick people into thinking that by keeping the blocks on Bitcoin small, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=632.68s)]
*  it would make it more decentralized. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=637.0799999999999s)]
*  And literally the exact opposite of the truth, the exact opposite of the way Satoshi Nakamoto, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  the creator of Bitcoin, designed it and promoted it, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=643.4799999999999s)]
*  and the exact opposite of the way that people were using it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=645.56s)]
*  And nobody believed the propaganda initially. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=647.7199999999999s)]
*  But then later, this giant wave of censorship took place. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=650.2s)]
*  Anonymous people that nobody knows their real names managed to get control of all [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  the main discussion platforms for Bitcoin. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=657.08s)]
*  And then suddenly one day overnight, nobody was even allowed to advocate for Bitcoin being [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=659.96s)]
*  used as money. And they censored anybody that tried to do that. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=663.88s)]
*  And initially everybody saw through it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=668.2s)]
*  But then everybody that came to Bitcoin after the censorship began, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=669.72s)]
*  they just started believing it. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=673.5600000000001s)]
*  And today, the main people that are out there promoting Bitcoin, they literally say, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=675.1600000000001s)]
*  Bitcoin shouldn't compete with the US dollar. Bitcoin, you shouldn't use it as money. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=679.24s)]
*  You shouldn't use it to pay for things. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=683.4s)]
*  Bitcoin is just a digital asset. You should just hold it. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=685.0s)]
*  And it's the exact opposite. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=687.8s)]
*  They've, through the censorship and the propaganda, they've literally hijacked Bitcoin. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=689.08s)]
*  And I literally wrote an entire book about it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=693.4s)]
*  You can find more at hijackingbitcoin.com. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=695.24s)]
*  It's available on Amazon and everywhere else. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=697.48s)]
*  And lo and behold, just a couple of weeks after the book is published, [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=699.64s)]
*  I get arrested and now I'm facing 109 years in federal prison for having exposed the way [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=703.72s)]
*  in which Bitcoin was hijacked. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=708.6s)]
*  And you can think all day long that the new version of Bitcoin that people are promoting [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=709.8000000000001s)]
*  is better. OK, but you can't admit that it wasn't hijacked. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=714.28s)]
*  And luckily now we have thousands of different cryptocurrencies. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=717.4s)]
*  And I support competition. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=719.72s)]
*  I was never a Bitcoin maximalist or any other cryptocurrency maximalist. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=721.64s)]
*  I'm a utilitarian freedom maximalist. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  Whatever gives the most utility and is the most useful for the most people around the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=726.9200000000001s)]
*  world to improve their lives and create more economic freedom that leads to more economic growth. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  That's what I want to be out there and promote to the world. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=734.2s)]
*  So a bunch of questions, but let's just begin with the core promise of Bitcoin, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=736.12s)]
*  as we both remember vividly, was that I would be able to conduct transactions by goods and [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=741.48s)]
*  services privately without federal control, that there was anonymity because it was digital. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=747.88s)]
*  And I could sort of have freedom in the things that I bought. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=756.44s)]
*  How exactly did they control conversation about that? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=762.0400000000001s)]
*  You say that they censored the discussion boards. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=769.72s)]
*  Can you explain exactly how that works? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=774.12s)]
*  So there were two main discussion platforms where everybody was talking about Bitcoin. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=776.84s)]
*  And that one was called BitcoinTalk.org. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=780.9200000000001s)]
*  And then another was our Bitcoin on Reddit. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=783.48s)]
*  And everybody was busy talking about Bitcoin in those places. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=785.96s)]
*  And the same anonymous individual managed to get moderatorship position or ownership [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=788.52s)]
*  of both of those forums. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=792.84s)]
*  And one day he decided to turn on the censorship and they would ban anybody that would state [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=794.52s)]
*  anything that wasn't in line with the small block propaganda about Bitcoin. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=800.4399999999999s)]
*  And when the censorship first began, people started a thread on Reddit complaining about [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=805.8s)]
*  the censorship. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=809.24s)]
*  At that point, it was the most upvoted thread ever in the entire history of that Bitcoin subreddit. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=810.36s)]
*  And what did they do? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=815.88s)]
*  They then deleted that post as well and banned the people that were participating in that post. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=816.84s)]
*  And the censorship still goes on to this very day. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=820.84s)]
*  If you go on our Bitcoin or BitcoinTalk.org and post anything in favor of Bitcoin being [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=823.0s)]
*  able to scale to be money for the world, they will ban your account. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=827.24s)]
*  And it's really, really a shame. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=830.2s)]
*  So the average person that's involved in Bitcoin today, they just see, oh, the price is about [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=831.64s)]
*  $100,000 each. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=835.24s)]
*  And Michael Saylor is talking about, you know, pay your taxes and don't be inflammatory. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=836.6s)]
*  Don't compete with the US dollar. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=841.08s)]
*  That's going to make Visa a master card and the government angry. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=842.2800000000001s)]
*  Don't do any of that. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=845.08s)]
*  He's saying literally the exact opposite of what everybody was saying in the beginning [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=845.96s)]
*  of Bitcoin, which is like this finally gives people a choice as to what form of money they [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=849.08s)]
*  were to use. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=852.76s)]
*  And so imagine if everybody was using Bitcoin as money in commerce to, you know, do their [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=853.48s)]
*  payroll and buy things online and pay for everything. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=858.36s)]
*  How would the US government be able to give billions and billions of dollars to Ukraine [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=861.72s)]
*  when most people don't want that to happen? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=865.4000000000001s)]
*  How would they be able to spend billions and billions of dollars on all these foreign wars [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=867.24s)]
*  that most people don't want to be able to have happen? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=870.44s)]
*  They wouldn't be able to just inflate it out of thin air. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=872.44s)]
*  Suddenly, government would be much, much more accountable to the people. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=874.84s)]
*  And, you know, they teach everybody in school, oh, government, you know, government works [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=877.72s)]
*  for the people. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=881.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, if people were using a hard asset cryptocurrency as money in everyday life, government really [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=882.36s)]
*  would have to be much more accountable to the people than they are today. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=887.24s)]
*  And that's why government doesn't want that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=890.2s)]
*  So that's why they've been doing everything they can to subvert Bitcoin and prevent people [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=891.96s)]
*  from being able to use cryptocurrencies as money in daily life, whether it's from tax [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=895.5600000000001s)]
*  policy or tax reporting or exit taxes or anything else. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=899.0s)]
*  They're making it as difficult as possible. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=902.2800000000001s)]
*  In fact, even the people that are in the studio here that we're recording this with, I offered [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=904.2800000000001s)]
*  to pay them in cryptocurrency. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=908.12s)]
*  The reason they didn't want it is because they're scared of the tax ramifications around [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=909.24s)]
*  it because government's going to lose control of the money supply. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=912.36s)]
*  And if they lose control of the money supply, they lose control of most of their control [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=915.6400000000001s)]
*  of society. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=919.32s)]
*  But if you believe in individual rights and individual freedom and people being in charge [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=919.88s)]
*  of their own destiny, it's a wonderful thing when government loses the ability to control [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=923.6400000000001s)]
*  people's lives. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=927.32s)]
*  And that's why I'm so excited about Bitcoin. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=927.88s)]
*  I've been involved almost 15 years. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=929.96s)]
*  I've been promoting cryptocurrencies as currency for people worldwide, whether you're stuck [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=931.8s)]
*  in Spain awaiting extradition or in the US or anywhere else on the planet. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=936.4399999999999s)]
*  Cryptocurrencies is for everybody. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=940.1999999999999s)]
*  And they need to go head to head and compete with the US dollar and the euro and the yen [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=942.12s)]
*  and the ruble and everything else. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=946.12s)]
*  Because when people have more choices, their lives are better off and it results in more [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=947.64s)]
*  economic freedom. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=951.4s)]
*  More economic freedom results in more economic growth and more economic growth raises everybody's [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=952.52s)]
*  standard of living, which literally makes every single person's life on the planet [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=956.68s)]
*  a better off. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=960.04s)]
*  And that's why it's such an exciting thing for me to be involved in. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=960.6s)]
*  And that's why I'm doing it despite risking 109 years in federal prison for just telling [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=963.8000000000001s)]
*  people about these amazing ideas and technologies. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=968.0400000000001s)]
*  Now, we've told you before about a staff favorite here at TCN, the 8 Sleep Pod. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=970.76s)]
*  What is it? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=977.8000000000001s)]
*  It's a high tech mattress that we talk about over lunch here, our mattresses, because this [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=978.28s)]
*  one is excellent. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=982.76s)]
*  High tech, it's a cover. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  It goes right over your existing bed. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=985.24s)]
*  Well, this Christmas you can get it for the best price of the year, up to 600 bucks off. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=987.3199999999999s)]
*  The 8 Sleep Pod works by adjusting the temperature, warmer or cooler, depending on your preference. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=992.92s)]
*  And it maintains an ideal sleeping network all night long. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=998.04s)]
*  You might not know this, but through different phases of sleep, every night your body's needs [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1001.8s)]
*  change. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1007.3199999999999s)]
*  Sometimes you want it warmer, sometimes colder. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1007.64s)]
*  That's why you throw the sheets off. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1009.4s)]
*  That's why you pull them around you other parts of the night. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1010.76s)]
*  You don't have to do that anymore with 8 Sleep because it automatically keeps things [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1013.64s)]
*  exactly where you want them throughout your entire night's sleep, what's called the sleep [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1016.92s)]
*  cycle. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1021.24s)]
*  And it's been studied, it's clinically proven to increase quality sleep time every night [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1022.12s)]
*  that improves your recovery time from physical exertion, makes you a little sharper, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1026.68s)]
*  makes your health better. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1030.44s)]
*  It learns and adapts to your sleep patterns over time and then automatically adjust [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1032.2s)]
*  temperatures throughout the night through each phase of your sleep. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1036.36s)]
*  And it does this independently for up to two people in a bed. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1039.56s)]
*  So each person can have a tailor-made sleep. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1044.2s)]
*  It really helps. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1049.08s)]

*  Strong families are built on strong foundations. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1066.52s)]
*  And it all begins with what you bring into your home. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1069.08s)]
*  It's hard though because Big Pharma and the processed food industry have spent decades [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1071.6399999999999s)]
*  putting you and your loved ones at risk, pushing toxic, harmful products that make you sick, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1076.4399999999998s)]
*  that have made our country sick. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1082.28s)]
*  It's not a guess. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1083.48s)]
*  That's happened. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1084.12s)]
*  So it's well past time that someone decided to help you fight back. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1085.3999999999999s)]
*  Public Square is doing that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1088.6799999999998s)]
*  Public Square is the leading family marketplace where you will find clean, healthy products [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1090.9199999999998s)]
*  sourced from American small businesses that actually share your values. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1095.32s)]
*  With Christmas right around the corner, now is the time to abandon the corporate food [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1100.1200000000001s)]
*  conglomerates in favor of something better, healthier, more pure. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1104.2s)]
*  Make the switch. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1108.2s)]
*  Stock your home with the quality essentials and shop for gifts your whole family will love. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1108.84s)]
*  And it's easy. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1112.44s)]
*  Public Square dot com slash Tucker. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1113.48s)]
*  And you can get started. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1115.64s)]
*  Public Square dot com slash Tucker. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1116.44s)]
*  So the original promise was Bitcoin will make you free and then it became quickly through [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1118.68s)]
*  subversion. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1122.68s)]
*  Bitcoin will make you rich. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1123.24s)]
*  And that was enough to kind of derail the promise. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1125.56s)]
*  I should note that you are rich from Bitcoin. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1128.44s)]
*  I mean, and you could very easily kind of not say anything and just be happily rich [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1131.64s)]
*  with Bitcoin because you bought a lot of it early. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1137.16s)]
*  And so it sounds like your ideological commitment is overriding your financial interests. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1140.44s)]
*  It's not even close for me. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1147.32s)]
*  So like I was a multimillionaire before Bitcoin had ever even been invented. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1148.52s)]
*  I had my own tech companies in Silicon Valley that had done very well for me. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1152.6s)]
*  Lots of people talk about, oh, win Lambo when I'm going to sell my Bitcoin and buy a Lambo. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1156.04s)]
*  I had had multiple Lamborghinis before Bitcoin had ever even been invented. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1159.7199999999998s)]
*  When Bitcoin came along, I was such a big believer in Bitcoin that I sold my Lamborghini [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1163.08s)]
*  to buy more Bitcoin. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1167.3999999999999s)]
*  That's how excited I was about this philosophically and emotionally and intellectually, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1168.52s)]
*  because this is literally one of the best tools the world has ever seen to give individuals [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1173.24s)]
*  more control over their own lives. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1177.8s)]
*  And so I was headed in the exact opposite direction of most of the people that are [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1179.1599999999999s)]
*  involved in Bitcoin today. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1182.52s)]
*  I was selling things to buy more Bitcoin because I knew this was going to become money for [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1184.36s)]
*  the world. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1188.4399999999998s)]
*  And today, maybe it'll be Bitcoin, maybe it'll be a different cryptocurrency, but [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1188.84s)]
*  cryptocurrencies are still certainly the way of the future. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1192.12s)]
*  And remember, today is 2024. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1194.9199999999998s)]
*  When Bitcoin first came out, there was no Apple pay. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1198.6s)]
*  There was no Zelle. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  There was barely any of this thing. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1201.96s)]
*  Like there was almost no competition, but government successfully delayed the adoption [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1203.1599999999999s)]
*  of cryptocurrency so that now suddenly the traditional financial systems had a chance [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1207.0s)]
*  to catch up and get a lot more done. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1210.84s)]
*  And it's just really, really frustrating because life is short. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1214.36s)]
*  As anybody, you know, as each year goes by, they go by faster and faster and there's less [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1217.0s)]
*  and less of each of our lifespans left. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1222.84s)]
*  We need the benefits brought by cryptocurrency as soon as possible. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1224.76s)]
*  And we know all the benefits for the world as soon as possible. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1227.72s)]
*  Like let's not waste time. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1229.8s)]
*  That's exactly what governments around the world have been doing. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1231.16s)]
*  They've been delaying and hindering the adoption of cryptocurrency as money, which is literally [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1233.6399999999999s)]
*  delaying the progress of all of humankind and all of human society. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1238.36s)]
*  And it's really frustrating to see that happen. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1241.08s)]
*  The most frustrating part from my perspective is the inability to use cryptocurrency, apparently, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1244.12s)]
*  with any privacy. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1250.44s)]
*  I mean, that is the core promise. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1251.72s)]
*  I earned the money, didn't do anything wrong, and I would like to buy something that's sort [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1254.28s)]
*  of no one's business, whether I'm buying it or not. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1259.0s)]
*  And I would like to do that in privacy. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1262.36s)]
*  I don't think that's a weird thing to want. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1263.8799999999999s)]
*  It's a human thing to want. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1266.04s)]
*  And is that possible? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1267.9599999999998s)]
*  This is my question. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1270.76s)]
*  Is it now possible to conduct any kind of business with crypto anonymously? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1271.4799999999998s)]
*  So in the early days, everybody thought Bitcoin was basically anonymous and people treated [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1277.32s)]
*  it that way. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1280.9199999999998s)]
*  And then websites came up that were selling things that governments might not necessarily [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1281.4799999999998s)]
*  want you to buy. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1285.7199999999998s)]
*  And people were using Bitcoin for that because they thought it was basically anonymous. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1287.08s)]
*  And then later on, we found out that it wasn't anonymous at all. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1289.96s)]
*  But additional steps were taken to make Bitcoin even less anonymous. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1293.08s)]
*  And today, most people are just using custodial wallets, which are not even a wallet. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1296.52s)]
*  It's just an account. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1300.44s)]
*  And it's no more private than your Bank of America or PayPal account. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1301.16s)]
*  In fact, it's even less private than those things because anybody can take a look at [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1304.44s)]
*  the blockchain and see what's there. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1307.72s)]
*  But luckily, there's other cryptocurrencies out there that do give people more privacy. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1309.08s)]
*  So there's things like Monero, which most people are now using if they want some privacy. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1312.92s)]
*  But there's even more exciting technologies and coins out there. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1317.08s)]
*  There's another one called Zano that allows anybody to create their own privacy token [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1319.48s)]
*  in which nobody can see what's going on. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1323.24s)]
*  And if you really want to get the three letter agencies upset or governments upset, there's [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1325.16s)]
*  a project called Confidential Layer, which is creating a bridge from Bitcoin, Bitcoin [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1329.48s)]
*  Cash, and Ethereum onto Zano. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1334.84s)]
*  So you can take Bitcoin with no privacy at all or Ethereum with no privacy at all and [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1337.32s)]
*  bridge it permissionlessly with no custodian and no central point of attack onto Zano. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1341.16s)]
*  And when it's on Zano, you have very, very strong privacy with that as well. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1346.36s)]
*  And so I think that's going to make a whole lot more privacy come to the entire cryptocurrency [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1349.3999999999999s)]
*  ecosystem. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1353.72s)]
*  But governments are going to hate that. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1354.6s)]
*  Like Monero that I mentioned before, it's preemptively banned from being listed on most [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1355.96s)]
*  exchanges in most of the world at this point. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1359.8799999999999s)]
*  And that's simply because governments have much less of an ability to spy on people that [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1362.2s)]
*  are using things like Monero or Zano. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1366.04s)]
*  And that's why I'm a big fan of things like Monero or Zano today. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1368.2s)]
*  And in fact, today, I would be embarrassed to promote, I am embarrassed to promote Bitcoin [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1372.04s)]
*  to people today because the transactions are slow, expensive, unreliable, and you have [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1376.76s)]
*  no privacy. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1380.92s)]
*  I'd be proud to promote something like a Monero or a Zano or a Zcash or a Zcoin or any of these [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1381.88s)]
*  privacy tools out there because those are the ones that provide more individual control [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1386.04s)]
*  to people and more privacy and more economic freedom to people over the world. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1390.76s)]
*  People are claiming that Bitcoin is freedom money, but I'm really afraid that they're [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1393.96s)]
*  literally building the financial prison walls around themselves. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1396.92s)]
*  Like if you look at what's going on in El Salvador, everybody's excited about Bitcoin [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1399.48s)]
*  there, but they're all using custodial accounts that the government can see every single [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1402.84s)]
*  transaction you're making and they can freeze your account at any time. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1406.84s)]
*  That's the exact opposite of economic freedom. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1410.2s)]
*  That's economic government control. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  And so anybody that's paying attention should be really, really concerned about this. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1414.04s)]
*  And they should be advocating the use of cryptocurrencies in which individuals can [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1417.48s)]
*  actually have control of their own money and have control over their own lives, their own [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1420.6s)]
*  destiny. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1423.4s)]
*  And maybe that'll be Bitcoin thanks to this new technology called confidential layer. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1423.88s)]
*  That bridges it onto Zeno. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1429.5600000000002s)]
*  But and I don't know what it's going to be, but like we need to be really, really careful [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1431.0800000000002s)]
*  because it could wind up that before we know it and before we realize it, we've built the [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1435.0s)]
*  financial prison walls around us and it's too late to get out and too late to escape. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1439.4s)]
*  So let's be aware of this today and watch out. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1442.92s)]
*  A lot of people in the crypto world, I think, are admirable people. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1448.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm friends with some of them. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1452.1200000000001s)]
*  One you mentioned actually, people I like and admire and largely agree with. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1453.24s)]
*  But I'm a little bit confused as to why you're the only person I've ever heard say what you [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1457.8799999999999s)]
*  just said. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1461.8s)]
*  Why aren't the people promoting various cryptocurrencies also sounding the alarm that [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1462.44s)]
*  none of the transactions you conduct using these currencies are private? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1468.68s)]
*  In fact, they're very easily trackable by government. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1471.8799999999999s)]
*  Why is nobody saying that? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1473.8s)]
*  Because the censorship and propaganda works. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1475.08s)]
*  Lots of people are saying that, but very few people other than myself have a big enough [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1477.3999999999999s)]
*  platform or loud enough voice to get much attention. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1481.8s)]
*  Because I had such a big platform and big voice, boom, suddenly I'm looking at 109 [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1484.44s)]
*  years in prison. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1488.6s)]
*  I don't think that's a coincidence at all. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1489.32s)]
*  Again, the solution to ideas or people saying things that you don't agree with is more [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1492.36s)]
*  debate and more discussion and more free speech. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1497.56s)]
*  Whereas most of the people promoting Bitcoin at this point, they've taken the exact opposite. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1499.8799999999999s)]
*  They've been supporting the propaganda and the censorship, which I'm on the exact opposite. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1504.12s)]
*  In fact, initially when the debate started happening as to what should be the proper [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1509.08s)]
*  scaling method for Bitcoin, my heart was already on what was called the big block side, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1512.44s)]
*  but I wanted to be open to the other arguments. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1517.4s)]
*  And so I was just quiet and started listening. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1520.52s)]
*  And as I tried to listen, suddenly one side started to try and censor the other side. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1522.76s)]
*  And I already knew I was on the side of free speech. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1527.24s)]
*  So as soon as one side tried to censor the other side, I knew, okay, it's time for me [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1529.24s)]
*  to speak up now. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1533.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm on the side of free speech and I'm on the side of Bitcoin being able to scale in [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1533.64s)]
*  the original way that Bitcoin white paper scribed as peer to peer cash for the entire [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1537.0800000000002s)]
*  world. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1541.72s)]
*  That's very different than just the speculative asset. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1542.28s)]
*  Everyone today is excited. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1544.92s)]
*  Bitcoin's about almost $100,000. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1545.96s)]
*  Maybe it would have been $100,000 half a decade ago if it hadn't been hijacked and hadn't [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1548.44s)]
*  been destroyed in its usefulness as cash for the world. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1552.68s)]
*  So you need to look at what's seen and what's not seen. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1555.24s)]
*  And what we see today, okay, it's close to $100,000. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1557.8799999999999s)]
*  What's not seen is what it could have been if companies like Microsoft and Expedia and [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1560.44s)]
*  these other big companies around the world didn't have to stop accepting Bitcoin because [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1564.68s)]
*  of its slow transaction fees, slow transaction times and unreliable transactions and lack [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1568.6s)]
*  of privacy as well. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1573.7199999999998s)]
*  So it's really disappointing. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1574.6s)]
*  But thank you for giving me a platform to help sound the alarm because I don't want [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1576.6799999999998s)]
*  to see the entire world wind up imprisoning themselves inside of some sort of financial [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1580.12s)]
*  prison that they're building, even if it has a cool sounding name like Bitcoin. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1584.76s)]
*  Who is Satoshi? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1587.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1589.8s)]
*  And if anybody knows, I'm not aware of that. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1590.6799999999998s)]
*  But whoever he is or wherever he is, he literally invented one of the most important things [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1594.04s)]
*  in the entire history of humankind up there on par with how important the invention of [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1598.28s)]
*  electricity or the transistor or the Internet was. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1602.04s)]
*  It really is one of the most world changing technologies ever. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1604.04s)]
*  And so whoever he is, wherever he is, or they are or she is, they deserve their privacy [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1607.32s)]
*  because clearly that's what they want. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1611.8799999999999s)]
*  So it doesn't sound like you're suspicious that Bitcoin was created by the intel agencies [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1614.28s)]
*  as a way, as a kind of trap for people. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1619.8799999999999s)]
*  I don't think it was created that way initially, but I am suspicious. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1623.88s)]
*  And I do think that the intel agencies and other groups have converted it and hijacked [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1628.52s)]
*  it into becoming a financial trap. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1633.16s)]
*  I just want to apologize, but we were we were laughing or I was laughing off camera saying [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1635.32s)]
*  you're such you're so great at explaining this. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1639.72s)]
*  No wonder they want to put you in prison. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1641.32s)]
*  I shouldn't have laughed at that as sort of an awful thing to say because they actually [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1642.68s)]
*  are trying to put you in prison. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1646.84s)]
*  And so rather than making fun of something so awful, I would love to know if you think [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1648.84s)]
*  you're actually going to go to prison. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1655.32s)]
*  Is there any way to stop this? [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1656.52s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of ways to stop this. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1658.76s)]
*  But the most useful way I think is to get the public to speak out, right? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1660.04s)]
*  Like the more people that speak out, the safer all of us can be. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1663.32s)]
*  And so one of the most egregious things here, too, is like the IRS with guns on their hip. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1667.1599999999999s)]
*  They literally showed up at my attorney's office and my accountant's office. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1673.08s)]
*  They raided my attorney's office, right? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1676.92s)]
*  You're not supposed to be able to do that in the US. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1678.76s)]
*  Like you're supposed to be able to talk to your attorneys and that's supposed to be private. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1680.92s)]
*  And so all the information is available over a website that supporters set up at [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1684.52s)]
*  freerogernow.org. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1689.24s)]
*  They recently filed what's called a motion to dismiss where you can literally see for [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1691.48s)]
*  your with your own eyes. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1695.48s)]
*  The US government is literally lying in their indictment and the proof is up there with [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1697.64s)]
*  the emails between myself and my attorneys. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1701.5600000000002s)]
*  You can go and see. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1703.0800000000002s)]
*  Please go take a look at it. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1703.96s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1705.0s)]
*  Take a look at that motion to dismiss. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1706.52s)]
*  They're lying. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1708.4399999999998s)]
*  They're lying to the court in Spain. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1709.08s)]
*  They're just lying every which way because they don't want the world to know the truth [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1710.6s)]
*  about cryptocurrencies that they can be used to empower individuals to have control of [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1713.8s)]
*  their own lives beyond the control of politicians who have never met you and they don't know [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1717.32s)]
*  about you in your life. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1721.32s)]
*  And most of them don't care about you one bit. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1722.1999999999998s)]
*  So like the fact that now people anywhere on the planet have access to money that can [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1724.28s)]
*  use to escape deflation or they can use it to escape other apportionary tactics. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1728.12s)]
*  Cryptocurrency is an amazing, amazing tool for freedom around the world. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1732.76s)]
*  Governments are the opposite of freedom. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1736.2800000000002s)]
*  They don't like people having more freedom and that's why they don't like cryptocurrency [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1737.5600000000002s)]
*  and that's why they're trying to shut me up. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1740.2800000000002s)]
*  I wish I had even more hard proof, but I don't think it's a coincidence. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1743.24s)]
*  They arrested me as soon as my book came out and I was about to go on a big media tour [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1746.5200000000002s)]
*  promoting the fact that Bitcoin has been hijacked and suddenly they have me arrested [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1750.2s)]
*  and tossed into jail for a month in Barcelona and they were furious that I got out on bail. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1753.4s)]
*  But this is the first media interview I've done since I've been out. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1758.2s)]
*  I've been out over six months now. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1760.7600000000002s)]
*  This is a really, really big deal for the entire world. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1763.0s)]
*  This isn't just an American thing. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1766.04s)]
*  This is literally affects every single person on the planet. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1767.32s)]
*  And so like another example of that is Apple. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1770.68s)]
*  People all over the world use iPhones. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1772.76s)]
*  Apple is an American company, but it affects every single person on the planet. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1774.2s)]
*  Every year new Apple products come out. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1777.8799999999999s)]
*  People all over the planet that aren't Americans also get to benefit from it. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1779.56s)]
*  Americans get to benefit from it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1782.52s)]
*  Everybody gets to benefit from it. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1784.12s)]
*  It's the same with cryptocurrencies. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1785.6399999999999s)]
*  Everybody on the planet, even if it's somebody working on it in the US or Spain or somewhere else, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1787.16s)]
*  everybody on the planet gets to benefit from it. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1791.8799999999999s)]
*  And by benefit from it, I mean, they get to have more control over their own lives, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1795.48s)]
*  their own finances, and their own financial sovereignty. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1798.84s)]
*  Governments hate that. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1801.48s)]
*  That's why they're trying to stop it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1802.44s)]
*  And that's why they don't want you to read hijacking Bitcoin. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1803.72s)]
*  So you can hear with citations for everything how Bitcoin was hijacked. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1805.96s)]
*  And people are promoting it today is literally the exact opposite of what it started out as. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1809.96s)]
*  Do you remember when Democrats used to refer to abortion as something that should be [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1814.12s)]
*  safe, legal, and rare? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1817.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, they've changed their view on that. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1819.3999999999999s)]
*  It went from a right to a sacrament. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1821.4s)]
*  This isn't the pro-choice movement you may remember from 30 years ago. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1824.2s)]
*  This is something much darker. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1828.52s)]
*  And that's why we have joined forces with preborn, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1830.52s)]
*  they're a sponsor of the show and of our speaking tour, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1833.0800000000002s)]
*  to do something about it. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1835.88s)]
*  It's the largest pro-life organization in the United States. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1836.8400000000001s)]
*  And they are doing what they should do, which is speaking up against this atrocity, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1839.8000000000002s)]
*  killing babies after birth. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1845.64s)]
*  No one seems to have the bravery to call that wrong. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1848.44s)]
*  Which it is. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1851.24s)]
*  But preborn is calling it out. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1852.52s)]
*  Their networks of clinics are positioned in the highest abortion areas in the country. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1854.44s)]
*  And they've rescued 300,000 babies. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1858.76s)]
*  When a woman considering an abortion searches to end her baby's life, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1860.68s)]
*  preborn is there. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1864.1200000000001s)]
*  The power of ultrasound, combined with the love of God, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1865.64s)]
*  doubles the baby's chance of being born. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1868.76s)]
*  A single ultrasound costs 28 bucks. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1871.16s)]
*  Five ultrasounds are 140 bucks. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1873.88s)]
*  Giving women the information they need to make the decision that many of them [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1876.76s)]
*  actually want to make to have a baby. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1880.68s)]
*  Any gift will help and all gifts are tax deductible. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1884.04s)]

*  And when asked, use the word baby. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1893.24s)]
*  So is Christmas really about buying stuff? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1895.88s)]
*  You'll be forgiven if you assumed it is because that's the message you receive. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1899.24s)]
*  But most people sense deep down there may be a little bit more to Christmas. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1903.8s)]
*  Maybe this is the time of year to focus on growing your relationship with God. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1908.2s)]
*  To remember there is a God and reach out to that God. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1911.88s)]
*  Well, to do that, you can check out Hallow, the Hallow app, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1915.56s)]

*  Spend this Christmas working on something that matters. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1961.32s)]
*  Your relationship with God. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1963.72s)]
*  Maybe the only thing that matters. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1965.32s)]
*  We hope you will. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1966.4399999999998s)]
*  Hallow. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1967.32s)]
*  I'm a little bit surprised that the government of Spain is honoring the extradition request. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1968.76s)]
*  I mean, the US government just sent $100 billion to Ukraine without an audit. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1975.72s)]
*  To the most corrupt country in Europe, $100 billion. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1979.96s)]
*  Didn't even bother to audit it. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1982.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, and a huge percentage is being stolen. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1983.8s)]
*  We know that. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1985.6399999999999s)]
*  They don't care. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1986.2s)]
*  So the idea that the US government is so upset that you, a non-citizen, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1987.56s)]
*  didn't pay US taxes, which you're not even obligated to pay, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1991.0s)]
*  is like absurd on its face. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1994.52s)]
*  How did the Spanish government participate in what's obviously a grotesque miscarriage of justice? [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=1997.0s)]
*  Why would they play along with that? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2004.44s)]
*  If I can interject, not only are they mad about the taxes, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2005.6399999999999s)]
*  I wasn't an American and I wasn't living in the US, right? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2008.9199999999998s)]
*  This is like, it's so good. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2012.52s)]
*  I was not American, not living in the US, and they're claiming I owe them more US taxes on [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2013.72s)]
*  the Bitcoin. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2017.3999999999999s)]
*  Like, it's just absolute insanity. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2018.04s)]
*  But if you look at it, when there's a political persecution, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2020.2s)]
*  they just have to make stuff up so they can grab the people. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2022.84s)]
*  And the most common way they do it is they use the government tax code, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2025.1599999999999s)]
*  because it's so incredibly complicated. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2027.8799999999999s)]
*  Even people that want to comply with every last little detail and how the best professionals, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2029.8799999999999s)]
*  like I did myself, it's too complicated. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2033.8s)]
*  They can get you if they want you, and that's what they do time and time again. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2036.76s)]
*  And so in regards to the Spanish government, I have an amazing attorney here, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2039.9599999999998s)]
*  a Jaime Campanero. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2043.08s)]
*  I'm really hoping that he's going to be successful here. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2044.36s)]
*  He's optimistic about the whole situation, but you don't know. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2047.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's a really terrifying way to live day to day. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2051.0s)]
*  If I win and Spain decides not to extradite me, they'll send me or my attorney a letter [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2054.12s)]
*  and say, congratulations, you're not being extradited. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2058.28s)]
*  If I lose and they decide to extradite me, they don't tell me in advance, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2061.0s)]
*  they'll just be a knock at my door one morning, and they'll grab me and they'll put me in jail, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2064.36s)]
*  and I'll have zero notice whatsoever. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2068.12s)]
*  I won't be able to return the rental car or tell the landlord or anything else. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2070.2s)]
*  They'll literally just come to my house, grab me one morning, and I won't know in advance [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2073.88s)]
*  which morning it's going to be. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2077.16s)]
*  It'll just happen one morning. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2078.04s)]
*  It's not a fun way to live day to day knowing if this is your last day, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2079.7999999999997s)]
*  not in prison potentially for the rest of your entire life. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2083.24s)]
*  But I'm cautiously optimistic that Spain will be able to see through this and see [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2086.7599999999998s)]
*  what a politically motivated persecution this is by a bunch of people that are just jealous. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2090.8399999999997s)]
*  Like if I hadn't been treated so unfairly politically the last time around when I ran [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2095.9599999999996s)]
*  for political office and tried to change the system within, I'd still be a proud, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2099.3999999999996s)]
*  flag-waving American today. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2103.7999999999997s)]
*  The values of my heart are still some of the most American values there are. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2105.64s)]
*  If you think about it, people say, oh, you renounced your U.S. citizenship. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2108.84s)]
*  That's not very patriotic. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2112.52s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2113.56s)]
*  That's exactly the values that America was founded on. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2114.44s)]
*  It was a bunch of British people that renounced their citizenship and said, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2116.84s)]
*  I don't like laws you guys are passing. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2119.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to be a part of this anymore. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2121.32s)]
*  So renouncing your citizenship is actually one of the most patriotic, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2122.6800000000003s)]
*  American-esque things you can possibly do. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2125.8s)]
*  I hope the Spanish government will be able to see. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2129.4s)]
*  I've been out there speaking out to the world about the benefits of cryptocurrency. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2131.4s)]
*  The U.S. government has the most to lose because the dollar is the world reserve currency, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2136.04s)]
*  so they like it less than even other governments. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2139.64s)]
*  This is clearly a politically motivated persecution. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2141.72s)]
*  My faith and hope and my dreams are with the Spanish government to not extradite me at this [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2147.16s)]
*  point. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2152.2s)]
*  And I hope they do the right thing and they can see what's going on. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2152.44s)]
*  But I also have, maybe I can beat the whole thing at trial as well, but you never know. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2155.0s)]
*  You're rolling the dice there even though I'm completely innocent. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2161.16s)]
*  But we also could have the Department of Justice and IRS just drop all the charges [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2163.48s)]
*  because I'm completely innocent. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2167.88s)]
*  And we literally fought this thing all the way to the Supreme Court in regards to my [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2170.76s)]
*  attorney-client privilege documents. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2174.04s)]
*  When they finally got access to those documents, they were probably mad because it was me literally [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2176.84s)]
*  telling my attorneys, do everything perfectly. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2181.0s)]
*  Do everything perfectly. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2183.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't want to have any problems. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2184.2000000000003s)]
*  And so they had a big giant letdown. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2185.32s)]
*  So there was a Supreme Court case in regards to myself. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2187.08s)]
*  People need to understand how insane it is that the IRS raided my tax attorney, their [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2189.64s)]
*  office. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2196.6s)]
*  How can you raid someone's attorney's office to violate attorney-client privilege in the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2197.08s)]
*  U.S.? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2200.92s)]
*  That's the stuff that all the U.S. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2201.48s)]
*  propaganda wants you to believe goes on in Russia all the time and other countries. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2202.68s)]
*  But they're doing it right there at home and where I was born and raised in the United [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2205.7999999999997s)]
*  States of America. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2210.04s)]
*  It's insane that that's going on. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2211.16s)]
*  So President Biden can do the right thing. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2212.92s)]
*  He just recently pardoned his son. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2215.24s)]
*  He can issue a preemptive pardon for me. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2218.04s)]
*  Trump, when he gets into office, if anybody knows what it's like to be the victim of lawfare, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2219.88s)]
*  it's Trump. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2223.4s)]
*  So I think he'll be able to see it in this case as well. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2224.2s)]
*  He can issue a preemptive pardon for me as well and a bunch of other people that deserve [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2226.84s)]
*  it. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2230.36s)]
*  I'm not the only one. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2230.92s)]
*  There's a whole long list of people out there that have been the victim of lawfare. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2232.04s)]
*  And more often than not, it's people that are engaged in something that the U.S. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2236.44s)]
*  doesn't like politically. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2239.16s)]
*  And if you rock the boat and the deep state doesn't like it, they're going to come after [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2240.44s)]
*  you. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2244.6s)]
*  And I'm just one more on that long, long, long list of people that they've attacked [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2244.84s)]
*  and trying to destroy their lives. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2249.48s)]
*  If I wasn't in this business, I wouldn't believe any of this. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2252.1200000000003s)]
*  I wouldn't think anything you were saying was true. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2255.32s)]
*  I've just seen it so often. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2257.1600000000003s)]
*  It's just a specific point. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2259.08s)]
*  Are you allowed to leave Spain or are you imprisoned by Spain? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2260.92s)]
*  Can you leave the country? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2264.92s)]
*  So no, not only can I not leave the country, I'm on an island in Spain, off the coast of [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2266.52s)]
*  Spain, called Mallorca. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2271.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm not even allowed to leave this island. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2272.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm not allowed to go on a boat. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2274.52s)]
*  I'm not allowed to do anything. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2275.8s)]
*  And every 48 hours, I have to check in with the court and show them my ID and prove that [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2277.0s)]
*  I didn't run away. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2280.6s)]
*  And again, any day could be my last year. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2281.64s)]
*  If they decide they are going to extradite me, they'll just show up unannounced and arrest [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2283.8s)]
*  me here in Spain and put me back in the Spanish prison and then at some point ship me to the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2287.32s)]
*  U.S. prison as well. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2290.92s)]
*  And so that's like a pretty nerve wracking way to live day after day here in Spain. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2292.12s)]
*  So Spain's a wonderful country, but I would love to be here voluntarily. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2296.36s)]
*  What? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2300.6s)]
*  It's shocking that Spain can act as the jailers for the U.S. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2301.32s)]
*  government on transparently fake charges. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2305.7200000000003s)]
*  What's... [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2308.76s)]
*  So you already spent a month in Spanish prison. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2309.1600000000003s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2311.4s)]
*  My Spanish is certainly better than it was before that happened. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2312.92s)]
*  I bet. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2315.96s)]
*  You know, prison slang. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2317.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2318.84s)]
*  And actually, because I'm such a clean cut, well-spoken guy, there were a couple of other [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2319.48s)]
*  people in the prison started to think I must be some sort of an American undercover spy, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2324.2000000000003s)]
*  spying on the prison. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2328.28s)]
*  So some of the other inmates were really wary of me and didn't want to speak to me. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2329.32s)]
*  Luckily, nobody found out who I was or what my role was in regards to cryptocurrency. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2332.84s)]
*  But some people were awfully suspicious of me and I was very glad to get out when I finally did. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2337.6400000000003s)]
*  And the U.S. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2342.52s)]
*  government was very angry that they granted me bail here in Spain. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2343.1600000000003s)]
*  They wanted to hold me in jail in Spain the entire time in a country. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2345.88s)]
*  I think this was only the second time I'd ever even visited Spain ever. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2349.8s)]
*  I thought I was only going to be here for four days. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2352.6000000000004s)]
*  There was a cryptocurrency conference about privacy cryptocurrencies here, about Zeno and [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2354.52s)]
*  Monero and things like that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2358.76s)]
*  I thought I was just going to be here for that. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2360.1200000000003s)]
*  And I was in the hotel lobby after the conference and some guy I didn't know came up to me with [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2361.5600000000004s)]
*  a thick Spanish accent and said, are you Roger Veer? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2366.0400000000004s)]
*  And I said, yes. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2368.36s)]
*  And Roger Veer? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2369.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2369.88s)]
*  And like three or four times back and forth. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2370.1200000000003s)]
*  And when I finally convinced him that I was Roger Veer and that we had overcome the language [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2371.7200000000003s)]
*  barrier, I thought he was a crypto guy and wanted to ask for like an autographed copy [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2375.4s)]
*  of my book or talk about crypto or something. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2379.1600000000003s)]
*  Then he pulled out his badge and said that he has an Interpol arrest warrant. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2381.0800000000004s)]
*  They arrested me right there in the lobby of the hotel in Barcelona and, you know, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2384.2000000000003s)]
*  hauled me off to jail in Spain. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2388.04s)]
*  And boy, was I not expecting that one bit to happen. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2389.24s)]
*  And talk about having your world turned upside down. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2392.84s)]
*  But it just makes me even more motivated because cryptocurrencies are such an [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2394.92s)]
*  powerful, powerful tool for every human being on the planet. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2398.92s)]
*  How could I not be quiet about spreading this good message to everybody around the world? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2402.12s)]
*  So congratulations, America. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2406.2799999999997s)]
*  You made me even more motivated to spread cryptocurrency adoption to the world. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2407.96s)]
*  That is just one of the craziest stories I think I've ever heard. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2412.36s)]
*  Roger, Godspeed. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2415.88s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2424.92s)]
*  My pleasure, Tucker. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2425.88s)]
*  And if I can ask people that want to show their support, please head over to [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2426.68s)]
*  freerogernow.org and I would deeply appreciate that. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2429.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2433.72s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2439.24s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2443.48s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake, Google would be putting [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2444.44s)]
*  its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing anything that the people in [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2449.16s)]
*  charge don't want you to hear. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2454.68s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2455.8s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2457.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2458.2000000000003s)]
*  But that's a waste of time. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2459.8s)]
*  I'm not in charge of Google. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2461.0s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2462.44s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2468.12s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2470.2000000000003s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance of hearing what we say. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2474.36s)]
*  And we hope you will. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbLHXOipQN4&t=2479.0s)]
