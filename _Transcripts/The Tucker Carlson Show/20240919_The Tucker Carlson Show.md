# Jesse Kelly & Nicole Shanahan Transhumanism, Kamala’s Plan to Take Your Guns, and How to Save Texas
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA)
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me. I love being here. Thank you. Oh, I know you. I feel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=0.0s)]
*  like I know a lot of people here. I have so many relatives in Texas that, no, it's true. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=15.76s)]
*  Some of them are from here, others fled as the rest of the country collapsed. I'm always [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=23.56s)]
*  so wonderful. I guess no matter where I was, if I was in Bayonne, New Jersey, I'd pretend [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=29.44s)]
*  to like it, but I actually do love Texas. I don't have to pretend. And I'm sure there's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=34.72s)]
*  great stuff going on in Bayonne. You don't even know where that is, do you? Good. Anyway, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=40.4s)]
*  thank you so much for having me. We have protesters outside, which I love. No, it's amazing. Someone [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=46.72s)]
*  just told me that. We've been on the road this our ninth night. We're going coast to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=53.78s)]
*  coast, 16 different cities. And the idea was, you know, you want to see the country that [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=57.32s)]
*  you love, that you were born in, that you're going to die in and that you really care about. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=63.32s)]
*  But also, they can't censor a live event. And there's something about being in a roomful [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=66.8s)]
*  of people you agree with that is so great. It's like a spa treatment. It's incredible. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=74.92s)]
*  If you spend your life experiencing the rest of the country through your phone or your [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  television or your radio, the eight people who still read newspapers through the newspaper, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=86.0s)]
*  you really get such a distorted sense. It's not an accident, of course. They're trying [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=92.36s)]
*  to make you dislike your country and have contempt for it and feel hopeless about it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=97.98s)]
*  But above all, they're trying to make you feel crazy, like you're the only person who [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=103.0s)]
*  feels the way that you do, that this is bizarre. You're thinking, this is bizarre. You know, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=107.32s)]
*  you're lying. You're insane. And that, I think, is a normal person's reaction to the news, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=112.6s)]
*  particularly recently. And of course, they're flipping it around on you and being like, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  no, no, no, everything's fine. You're crazy. You're crazy. And by the way, after a while, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  the Soviets used to do this to any sort of dissenter. You know, they put them in mental [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=129.4s)]
*  hospitals like, you're crazy. You don't think the experiment's working? It's working just [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  fine. And you know, the truth is, they can kind of convince you that there's something [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=138.08s)]
*  wrong with you or that you're an extremist or something because you think what they're [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=144.44000000000003s)]
*  doing is nuts. And that's one of the real reasons I wanted to get out and just be in [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  rooms full of people who are not crazy at all. They're the most normal people in the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=153.52s)]
*  country, which, by the way, is the whole country. I mean, the percentage of people who are on [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=161.56s)]
*  board with the things that are happening now is tiny. And the polls don't reflect it. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=166.8s)]
*  I mean, the polls are a reflection of a bunch of things. Part of it is party identification. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=171.20000000000002s)]
*  Part of it is fear, you know, convincing people that, you know, your side may be terrible, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=177.32000000000002s)]
*  but the other side is really dangerous. And part of them are just absolutely fake. I mean, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  they're not even real. They're designed to discourage you and to tell you a story that's [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  not rooted in reality. But whatever the cause of bad polling, it doesn't measure the difference [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=189.64000000000001s)]
*  between the truth about the country, which is most people are not mad at each other at [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  all. Most people have more in common than they don't. They live here. They're Americans. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=200.0s)]
*  They have basically 99% of things in common, and they're not mad at each other. And I know [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  that because I always think of myself as the most hated person in America. Probably some [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=208.96s)]
*  truth in that. But, you know, when I show up at your Quiznos or something for my unhealthy [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=212.44s)]
*  lunch, no one ever says anything nasty. I mean, everyone's nice. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=218.72000000000003s)]
*  Oh, I love you too. Were you at Quiznos? I think I saw you. You were getting the turkey. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=222.28s)]
*  But it's funny. It really is a lie. People in this country are not actually at an individual [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=234.0s)]
*  level divided by race or sex or party ID to anywhere near the extent that they tell you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=241.04000000000002s)]
*  At all. Who is actually for, I don't know, inflation or no borders or castrating your [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  kids and having no grandchildren? No one is for that. Like, nine rich ladies in LA are [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=254.56s)]
*  for that. Everybody else hates it. That's just true. And you're just reminded of that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  when you travel. And that's why I do wish I had had a chance to meet the protesters. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=265.52s)]
*  I kind of like protesters. They're just interesting. And when you confront them in person, they [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=270.44s)]
*  never have the stones to get mad at you. That was a little embarrassed. Are you calling [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=276.28s)]
*  me a Nazi? Oh, no, not you. That's my picture on your side. Well, I didn't see that. Okay. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=279.91999999999996s)]
*  But it's just so funny. I always have the exact same thought. Because, you know, you [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=290.11999999999995s)]
*  try to be reflective. And when people call you names, I do think it's really important [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=293.55999999999995s)]
*  to ask yourself honestly in some quiet place. The shower is a good spot. You know, is that [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=297.55999999999995s)]
*  true? Am I what they're calling me? Because you don't want to be the things they're [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=303.92s)]
*  calling you, actually. And you don't want to let them turn you into the things they're [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=307.76s)]
*  calling you, which is also part of the goal, to upset you so much that you become the hater [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  they claim you are. But so I have been through this process for, you know, so many years [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=316.8s)]
*  where they call you something and I actually do try to take stock. Like, am I that person? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't want to be that person. Am I that person? And the one thing that always makes [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=324.64s)]
*  me laugh is when, and I'm sure every person in this room has been called it, but an extremist. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=328.66s)]
*  You're an extremist! I was thinking, you know, whatever else I am, you know, a dessert [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=333.76s)]
*  eater, some other unattractive qualities, I'll admit it. But whatever else I am, I'm [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=340.48s)]
*  the opposite of an extremist. I hate change. My parents got divorced. I'm totally opposed [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=345.88s)]
*  to change. I don't like any change. It's just, I honestly have a really clear vision [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=350.52s)]
*  of America that doesn't strike me as extremist, it strikes me as the opposite. I liked America [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=356.44s)]
*  1985 actually very well. And I'm sure a lot of people in this room aren't old enough [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=360.44s)]
*  to remember 1985 and those of you who aren't may think, well, you know, did they have electricity [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=367.44s)]
*  and air conditioning and air travel then? Was the country segregated? No! It was awesome! [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=372.64s)]
*  There was very little conversation about the things that divided us. There was a ton of [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=381.72s)]
*  conversation about fun, irrelevant things like sports and the weather and like that [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=387.36s)]
*  really mattered. And in a healthy society, a happy society, people's focus is not entirely [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=391.76s)]
*  on politics, of course. Politics is what you do to make the things that are important possible [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=396.64s)]
*  like your marriage, your children, your religious faith, your job. Politics is the price you [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=402.08s)]
*  pay for the freedom to continue doing what you want to do, to live your life without [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=409.12s)]
*  bothering people. And in 1985, most people lived lives like that. I never heard of a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=412.52s)]
*  family in 1985 that was divided by politics. Everybody had some sort of crazy, you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=416.84s)]
*  organic peanut butter on, you know what I mean, who had sort of never gotten over the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=423.24s)]
*  sixties and she was sort of nice, long complicated earrings, faint aroma of incense, marijuana, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=426.84s)]
*  it wasn't clear what it was, but you know, a musky scent. And she was pretty enthused [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=432.88s)]
*  about the whales and she wasn't fully in touch with like shaving her body hair and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=439.88s)]
*  whatever, you know. But she wasn't mad at you. You weren't mad at her. You considered [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=443.6s)]
*  her faintly hilarious and she would like sit in Indian style and ask you about your feelings [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=450.96s)]
*  and you'd be like, okay. But there was no sense in which families that I recall anyway, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=455.4s)]
*  and I grew up in California, I'm embarrassed to say that to Texans since you've been invaded [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  by them. You should have built a wall actually on your western, no I'm serious. You should [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=467.36s)]
*  have, you should have, but you didn't. Man, they're everywhere and I can spot them. You [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=475.68s)]
*  know, you know your own people. Anyway, but there was no sense in which politics was the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=483.71999999999997s)]
*  most important thing at all because at the time, and this is the difference in 1985, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=491.72s)]
*  we had leaders, some of whom I agreed with, some of whom I didn't, but none of them took [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=498.72s)]
*  it as their personal mission to divide the country they led and make people hate each [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=502.72s)]
*  other. That would be unthinkable in 1985 and in fact would be unthinkable to any normal [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  person because the last thing you ever do is divide the people you're in charge of. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=514.0799999999999s)]
*  And if you're a parent, you know this. If you're a parent, your deepest desire, your [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=520.5999999999999s)]
*  secret dream, the thing that motivates you above all is the idea that your children will [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  love each other because you're going to be gone. As I heard someone say the other day, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=530.28s)]
*  where, you know, we lose our parents way too soon, we find our spouses and our children [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=537.28s)]
*  way too late, but it's our siblings who are with us from beginning to end and that's [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=544.92s)]
*  true and every parent knows that's true. And so the measure of a happy family, I've [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=548.64s)]
*  always thought, is the degree to which the children, the siblings, the brothers and sisters [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=553.52s)]
*  love each other and are united and that's what you leave behind much more than any real [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=557.68s)]
*  estate portfolio or money that you pass on is the love between your offspring. That's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=561.66s)]
*  such a natural desire. But it's true in every human organization. The leader's job is twofold. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=566.6s)]
*  One to be courageous because the bravest man is the leader regardless of title, doesn't [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=577.2s)]
*  matter, bravery is the indispensable quality in a leader period, period. And the second [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=583.36s)]
*  is the unity of the people you lead and that's true in your office, it's true in your platoon [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=590.9s)]
*  if you serve in the military and it's above all true in your family and of course it's [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=596.4s)]
*  true at scale in a country of 350 million people. And so it takes an extraordinary kind [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=599.56s)]
*  of leader, an evil leader, by definition evil, to set out to intentionally divide people [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=605.88s)]
*  he leads, period. And that is what we've seen. And you may be wondering, well wait a second, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=612.68s)]
*  aren't you getting to motive? How can you know the motive of our leaders? Because you [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=620.8s)]
*  can't see their hearts, only God knows what they really think and that is a fair rebuttal. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=626.16s)]
*  Now no one actually said that I'm anticipating your criticism ahead of time. And I've changed [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=630.44s)]
*  my thinking on this. I've always since I've been in journalism my whole life, I've always [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=636.36s)]
*  sort of kept away from guessing people's motives because honestly you can't know. But I have [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=639.12s)]
*  decided in middle age that actually I can know and I know motive by result. The result [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=644.28s)]
*  is the goal over time. In other words, if you keep doing something and winding up in [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=652.28s)]
*  a certain place, you meant to get to that place no matter what you tell me. It doesn't [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  matter what story you tell me, it doesn't matter what story you tell yourself. All I [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=663.52s)]
*  care about is the effect because I judge the tree by its fruits. You can tell me you're [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=667.56s)]
*  a lemon tree, but if pears come out, I think you're lying. To yourself or to me or both, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=674.56s)]
*  it doesn't matter. You're not a lemon tree, you're a pear tree. And so if the effect of [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=681.76s)]
*  your policies is to divide the people you lead and make them hate each other and divide [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=686.3199999999999s)]
*  the essential organization in human civilization in life, which is the family, you meant to [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=690.8399999999999s)]
*  do that and there's nothing more evil than that. When they sent us home for Thanksgiving [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=697.4399999999999s)]
*  three years ago and told us on television, your job when you get home for Thanksgiving, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=701.4s)]
*  a sacred secular holiday, the only holiday that all Americans share actually regardless [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=705.8s)]
*  of religious faith, Thanksgiving, where we give thanks for this nation that we inherited. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=710.84s)]
*  When they sent us home from cable news to Thanksgiving, they told us explicitly you [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=716.6s)]
*  go home and you find your uncle, your grandmother, your dad, whoever's not with the program, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=723.56s)]
*  and you lecture them about whatever, Black Lives Matter, the VACs, it doesn't matter, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=730.32s)]
*  COVID, the mask, social distancing. The pretext was irrelevant. The point was they worked [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=734.32s)]
*  intentionally to turn children against their parents, to turn Americans against their neighbors, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=742.0400000000001s)]
*  to turn the races against each other. They've been on that program for 60 years and it still [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=748.44s)]
*  hasn't worked. Most Americans do not hate each other on the basis of their race. Boy, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=752.8000000000001s)]
*  have they failed on that program. I've been called a racist a million times and yet I [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=758.76s)]
*  have never one time in all the years I've lived in this country, which is 55, ever been [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=768.3199999999999s)]
*  attacked by someone of a different race because I'm a racist. Not one person has ever said [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=773.84s)]
*  that. The only person who's ever said that to me are the private equity wives in the [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=778.04s)]
*  ski lift in Jackson Hole. I'm serious. Sitting trying to enjoy my elk chili at the Four [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=781.24s)]
*  Reasons between runs. It's the only people who've ever called me that are rich ladies. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=788.24s)]
*  I'm just being honest with you. And I always say the same thing, which is I don't like [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=792.36s)]
*  you actually. That doesn't make me racist. It just makes me discerning. And you sort [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=796.88s)]
*  of wonder, sorry, sorry, sorry, I will cop to bigotry. That's my bigotry. Sorry. I'll [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=808.0s)]
*  admit it. It actually makes you feel guilty to admit that there's a group of people I [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=814.0s)]
*  just don't like as a category, but it is private equity wives. So, sorry, now that [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=817.88s)]
*  I've gotten this, like an AA meeting, I'm just getting it all out there. I'm just telling [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=824.24s)]
*  you the truth. Those are my sins. But you sort of think to yourself, like, what happened? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=826.56s)]
*  What was the change? And the truth is, for whatever reason, and I think it's clearly [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=833.56s)]
*  a product of a spiritual battle in the unseen world, which is totally real, I didn't grow [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=837.88s)]
*  up thinking, I should also say, since we're being honest with each other, I am from La [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=843.48s)]
*  Jolla, California. Yeah, who said yeah? That's not a town where the spiritual battle was [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=847.0s)]
*  much discussed. We had one topic of conversation in La Jolla, which was the weather, which [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=855.72s)]
*  never changed, by the way, which is sort of amazing. I never realized it at the time, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=863.16s)]
*  but people in San Diego County in 1980 could talk for like all day about the weather, and [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=866.64s)]
*  the conversation would go something like, you know, it's 75 and partly cloudy. Yeah, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=871.36s)]
*  but this afternoon, it's going up to 77 and sunny, and then it's going to go back down [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=874.52s)]
*  to about 74. And this would go on for 12 months here. That was the only topic. You could bring [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=879.28s)]
*  up anything you wanted. It was very sort of open-minded. I mean, if you decided to become [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=884.4s)]
*  a lesbian nun, or you know, there was nothing too weird for my neighbors, right? The one [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=888.18s)]
*  thing you couldn't mention was anything transcendent. Like, for example, you were not allowed to [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=893.22s)]
*  die where I grew up. No dying. No one ever died at all. And if someone did die, like, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=896.72s)]
*  you could never talk about it. That was like very offensive. People didn't die. They just [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=901.72s)]
*  got in the car and drove to Palm Springs, and you just never… The presumption was [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=906.12s)]
*  they were on vacation. You never saw them again. There was no acknowledgement at all [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=909.4s)]
*  that they died, because that would raise the question of like, what happens next? And nobody [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=913.8000000000001s)]
*  wanted to talk about that. So I did not grow up in a world where, you know, the spiritual [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=918.84s)]
*  battle was discussed, acknowledged in any sense at all. I've come to this by watching [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=923.6600000000001s)]
*  empirically on the basis of evidence, and it's just so clearly true that human beings [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=929.92s)]
*  were being acted upon at all times by forces that they can't see, and that this has been [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=935.28s)]
*  the case since the beginning of recorded history, because all of history is about that battle. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=940.0s)]
*  Every religion, all literature, all art. And really, only people who grew up in La Jolla, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=944.88s)]
*  California in about 1980 didn't know that. So it's like a huge shock to me. What? I [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=951.24s)]
*  did it with, as I said, my cousins last night in Houston. I was telling them about this. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=956.72s)]
*  They're just like nodding, and I'm like, nobody's not unbelievable. And they're like, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=960.2s)]
*  yeah, duh. You know, we went to Second Baptist. We knew that. So the people… Some people have [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=962.6400000000001s)]
*  really changed. What's so striking in what I want the substance of tonight to be about is about how [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=973.12s)]
*  so many other people have changed in different ways. And that's a thing that nobody ever [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=980.84s)]
*  acknowledges or don't acknowledge enough, and that I don't acknowledge to myself enough. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=984.64s)]
*  And so I think if you're like me and you've been paying attention over the last several years, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=988.88s)]
*  like, what is this? This is not politics. Clearly, this is just evil. Let's just be honest. This is [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=992.76s)]
*  evil. There's no reason. Americans are so patriotic and nice and on the side of the little guy and the [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=997.4s)]
*  underdog. And you can absolutely gin up support for any kind of foreign conflict if you tell [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1004.1999999999999s)]
*  people we're on the side of good against the forces of evil. And once again, they're [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1009.4399999999999s)]
*  leveraging as they are with immigration your best instincts, your decency, your humanity, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1014.56s)]
*  your compassion, and using them against you. Okay? You're a good person. By the way, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1019.0s)]
*  Texas has had immigrants since it was a land-grant state, and they've been great for Texas, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1023.68s)]
*  I would say. There's no more pro-immigration state than Texas. And for good reason. Immigrants have [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1028.24s)]
*  been great for Texas. So when they open your border and just wreck your state with immigration, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1033.72s)]
*  it took Texans a little longer to figure out this was going on because they're like, no, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1038.0s)]
*  we're good people. We're welcoming people. And the same is true with foreign conflicts. Of course, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1042.08s)]
*  we're on the side of the little guy against fascism or whatever. And of course, and what you [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1046.8799999999999s)]
*  don't realize is that the immigration that they're doing now, the open borders immigration, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1050.96s)]
*  its only purpose is to destroy your country. That's the point. That's not a feature. That's [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1055.52s)]
*  what it's for. It's an act of punishment. It's an act of humiliation. They're trying to destroy the [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1064.24s)]
*  country that you grew up in because they hate it. Now, why do they hate it? It's a whole separate [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1070.32s)]
*  question. I'm not a theologian, but it's clear that they do. And on the war question, it's like, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1073.4399999999998s)]
*  no, sending, you know, a hundred billion or $400 billion to a country only to see its entire male [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1077.12s)]
*  population killed, that's not fighting for freedom. That's killing people actually. And the fact that [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1084.52s)]
*  you're getting rich in the process is really evil. So you know, things are getting flaky around the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1089.8s)]
*  world when prices change unexpectedly. Prices tend to change unexpectedly because something has [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1096.92s)]
*  happened to supply chains, global supply chains. All of a sudden you notice the price of ammunition [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1101.72s)]
*  goes up or you can't find common rounds. Where's all the rimfire? It's just gone. So if say the [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1106.28s)]
*  current occupants of the White House want to pretend the economy is doing well, they can release [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1112.92s)]
*  oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and we'll get a few weeks of lower gas price. Many common [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1116.3200000000002s)]
*  medications, life-saving medications are also susceptible to these forces. So today in September [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1122.16s)]
*  of 2024, nearly 30 states are reporting very high levels of the COVID virus. Now as we've seen, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1128.3600000000001s)]
*  what that actually means about individual health is kind of irrelevant. Government posturing can [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1135.5600000000002s)]
*  and does lead to stockpiling health supplies and then rising prices. So you're downstream, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1141.8000000000002s)]
*  all of us are downstream from all of that, from reckless policy makers. What can you do to protect [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1147.64s)]
*  your family? Well, obviously you want to be sure that in addition to everything else you've set [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1153.0400000000002s)]
*  aside just in case you have life-saving medications you might need if there were some bigger [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1156.72s)]
*  disruption. And you want to buy them now at a decent reasonable price. But how do you do that? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1163.3200000000002s)]
*  Well, it's hard. Who knows where to begin? JACE, JACE Medical offers something called the JACE [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1168.6000000000001s)]
*  case. It's a personalized emergency medication kit that contains essential antibiotics and [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1174.2s)]
*  medications that treat the most common and deadly bacterial infections. They include five life-saving [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1179.0800000000002s)]
*  antibiotics. You can even add on things like ivermectin and epipens that are sure to become [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1184.72s)]
*  scarce and hard to get if a crisis hits. And it feels like it might. So to get your JACE case, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1189.68s)]
*  visit jacemedical.com, fill out a form. It gets reviewed by a board-certified physician and your [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1195.76s)]

*  going on. Or social distance, take the Vax because you love your grandmother. I love my grandmother. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1229.04s)]
*  I would do anything for my grandmother. Good, then obey. And so it took decent people a couple [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1233.92s)]
*  years to figure out this is not about my grandmother. Actually, you don't care about my grandmother. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1239.92s)]
*  That's why she died alone. So the realization after a while is, wow, evil is real. Evil exists in the [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1243.84s)]
*  world. It's real. It's really shocking to a lot of people, very much including me. What I think is [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1254.16s)]
*  even more shocking and never acknowledged is the existence of good in the world. Why is that natural? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1259.68s)]
*  It's not. It's every bit as unnatural as evil. And by natural, I mean like a product of evolution. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1268.4s)]
*  Americans were trained in our secular society for the past 80 years to understand everything [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1276.72s)]
*  through the lens of evolutionary biology. People do what's good for them. And what's good for them [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1280.16s)]
*  is passing on their genes to future generations, like all animals. Like all animals are this way. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1285.1200000000001s)]
*  Why do dogs do what they do? Because they're interested in eating and having puppies. But [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1289.76s)]
*  every species is like that. And we were told that we're like that too. And so the idea that you [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1295.52s)]
*  would hurt someone for the sake of hurting him or that you would do good for the sake of doing good, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1300.0800000000002s)]
*  those do not fit into the template that we were taught growing up at all. There's no possible [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1305.2s)]
*  advantage that you derive from empathy, selflessness, altruism, deep compassion that [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1310.4s)]
*  doesn't help you pass on your genes. So why are you doing that? You're doing that because good [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1318.4s)]
*  exists in the universe as an independent force that acts on us as certainly as evil does. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1322.8s)]
*  And it's beautiful. And it's all around us. And we see it all around us. We see some people changing [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1327.6000000000001s)]
*  their face, becoming masks of hate and derangement, saying things that don't make any sense at all, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1335.6000000000001s)]
*  like at all. That moderation is extremism and love is hate and war is peace and the vax is safe and [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1341.1200000000001s)]
*  effective or whatever they're saying. None of it's true. And we're shocked by that. But at the same [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1348.24s)]
*  time, I bet if you take stock of your life, of the life that actually matters, which is the people [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1353.68s)]
*  that God put around you, beginning with your spouse, extending to your children, going out [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1358.56s)]
*  in concentric circles from there, to all of your relatives, to your parents, to your college [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1362.64s)]
*  roommates, to your co-workers, to your neighbors, the people in your actual sphere, the people who [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1366.8000000000002s)]
*  you talk to every day, the people you're responsible for, the people whose duty you have to make happy [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1370.64s)]
*  and to care for, you will find that your relationships with them are deeper and richer [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1378.3200000000002s)]
*  and more real and more honest than they've ever been. I know that that's true in my life. For all [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1384.16s)]
*  the friends and acquaintances I've lost, which is pretty much all of them, because I'm so extreme. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1388.24s)]
*  I'm sure every person in this room can relate. The relationships I have with the people who are [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1397.04s)]
*  left or the friendships that I've gained since then are so much more rewarding and richer than [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1402.24s)]
*  they ever were. I don't even have shallow conversations anymore and I love shallow conversations. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1408.72s)]
*  I'm from San Diego County. I can still talk about the weather. It is 74 with broken cloud cover. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1413.76s)]
*  It's incredible. And people are like, no, there's a spiritual war. I mean, people are so deep all of [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1420.8799999999999s)]
*  a sudden. And it's just so wonderful because what it shows you is that for every person who's decayed [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1426.32s)]
*  inside and been captured by dark forces, which is a lot of people, most of whom seem to live in [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1434.64s)]
*  Washington, there are so many more people who become bigger and more open and more aware of [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1439.2s)]
*  what connects all of us as human beings, all of us as children of God, who are so much more connected, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1446.48s)]
*  so much more selfless, so much more willing to lay down their lives for other people. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1452.4s)]
*  I see that all the time and it blows my mind. And why does it blow my mind? Because it's not natural. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1459.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not, there's no imperative in nature that you lay down your life for another person. In fact, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1465.92s)]
*  it's the opposite. So it's not natural. It's supernatural. It is the definition of supernatural. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1471.8400000000001s)]
*  And it's just the greatest blessing I've ever received, been privileged to see. I'm recognizing [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1483.28s)]
*  it all around me. Things are changing really, really fast. And so to prove that, we snuck in [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1488.0s)]
*  a guest tonight who we were planning to have. I was just brooding about this the other day. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1494.24s)]
*  And I was thinking about this amazing experience I had this summer with a woman called Nicole Shanahan. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1498.08s)]
*  And all I knew about Nicole Shanahan, I'd like read on Twitter based on New York Times stories. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1505.1200000000001s)]
*  And I should have known. Someone who's been the subject of many New York Times stories, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1513.6s)]
*  it made me not fully accurate. But the outline of the Nicole Shanahan story was what I thought [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1519.52s)]
*  I understood pretty well. So she's from California like me, from the Bay Area like me originally. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1525.04s)]
*  That she had been married to Sergey Brin, who was one of the founders and biggest shareholders of [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1530.4s)]
*  Google, was truly a force for dark, I think, in this world. He's the reason that we're not [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1535.2s)]
*  allowed to be treated as human beings and we're censored constantly, one of the reasons. And that [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1540.16s)]
*  she's an affluent lady from California and she looked kind of liberal to me. And I'm a [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1545.28s)]
*  judger on that subject. And I was like, okay. And then she's running with Bobby Kennedy, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1550.56s)]
*  who I love, but I didn't know anything about it. So I get this call from someone who works [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1556.08s)]
*  for Nicole Shanahan. She would like to meet you. And I said, okay. I mean, I'd meet anybody, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1560.96s)]
*  you know, because you want to be open-minded and be surprised by people. I've rarely been [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1566.56s)]
*  as surprised by anyone in my whole life as I was by Nicole Shanahan, who turned out to be one of [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1571.04s)]
*  the deepest and smartest and totally real people I think I'd ever met. And she was that way because [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1576.48s)]
*  in all people you meet, everyone I've ever met who's like truly deep, has had pretty much the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  same story. They changed. They were forced to change. Something happened in their life [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1590.6399999999999s)]
*  that required them to look inside and ask the basic questions like, what do I believe? Why am [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1595.6s)]
*  I doing this? Should I be doing this? Is this right or wrong? What is right or wrong? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1599.44s)]
*  We can float through life without asking those questions, but sometimes we're forced to answer [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1603.68s)]
*  them. And she was forced to answer them. And she changed in such an extraordinary way that I wanted [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1607.2s)]
*  to introduce her to those of you who haven't met her or are unaware of her. And I'm going to begin [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1614.0s)]
*  this by playing you a video that she made. And I was just talking to her. She's made a bunch of [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1618.3200000000002s)]
*  videos. So bottom line, just to end a very long story on an abrupt and telling note, she is now [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1622.24s)]
*  campaigning for Donald Trump for president. And I plan to ask her when she comes out, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1628.0s)]
*  like of all the things you never thought you'd be doing, that had to be number one, right? [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1636.48s)]
*  That and being like Queen of England or something. It's like what? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1641.84s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, Nicole Shanahan. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1646.08s)]
*  That is so good. What the hell was that? Thank you. Thank you. So I got to ask the question [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1648.32s)]
*  that I posed before you even arrived. If I had asked you at a dinner party in San Francisco [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1664.8s)]
*  five years ago, do you think you'd be in say Sugarland, Texas campaigning for Donald Trump? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1670.32s)]
*  Well, hi, Texas. I am so happy to be here. And I have a special gift from the Maha peoples to [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1677.84s)]
*  the Maga peoples. Make America healthy again and check out the back. Unity. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1686.8s)]
*  So what I think is so cool and interesting about your story and your honesty is that, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1700.72s)]
*  at a time when people feel in their gut that something is not right with the leadership of [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1706.96s)]
*  the country, you actually can say, you know, I've sort of been there. I've been around a lot of the [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1712.32s)]
*  people who are making these decisions. So I'd just be really interested in taking a minute to [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1717.76s)]
*  hear your story. What convinced you that you should change your mind on some things? Like, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1722.24s)]
*  how did you get here? Yeah, I'm from Oakland. I'm from Oakland, California. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1728.48s)]
*  Um, and I spent my life thinking that Democrats were good people and Republicans were bad people. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1734.48s)]
*  So it was taught to me in the school system. Um, and, you know, I went out to crossfire as a [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1742.5600000000002s)]
*  teenager. I was always interested in politics. And I went out. Crossfire, the fabled CNN program [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1750.0800000000002s)]
*  hosted by a very handsome man in a bow tie. Right. And I almost wore a bow tie tonight in celebration. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1756.0s)]
*  Um, and, you know, but I was out there to see James Carville debate you. And, and, you know, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1761.6s)]
*  I have to tell you, the programming is so strong on the left. Um, they, they earnestly believe [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1770.48s)]
*  what's being sold to them right now. And I came to this, you know, I made that Trump derangement [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1778.7199999999998s)]
*  syndrome ad for me. I made it for me. And I made it for all the people I know who are suffering [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1785.44s)]
*  from the lies the media is telling them. Um, and it's an offering. It's an offering to this country [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1794.64s)]
*  to unify, get over this BS and see what's actually happening here. And I came to this because, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1801.92s)]
*  you know, there's two things that change people. Um, grief and God. And it's usually grief that [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1809.9199999999998s)]
*  comes first. And, um, my grief was really, I always wanted to be a mother. And more than anything, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1817.4399999999998s)]
*  I wanted to be a mother. I wanted to be a lawyer too, but got that out of the way. I was always [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1828.32s)]
*  very smart. Um, but being a mother turned out to be a very convoluted experience. It turns out in [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1832.56s)]
*  this country right now. And if you're a liberal woman, you're told go harvest your eggs and freeze [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1839.76s)]
*  them. They tell you that now really early on. Um, and so I went through the process and during the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1846.48s)]
*  process, I realized a number of things, but I walked away with an understanding that science is [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1852.24s)]
*  also not what they're telling us today, that there's this corporate world that in the case of IVF [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1857.92s)]
*  runs the IVF clinics and the science of IVF is actually not based in well-researched, well [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1865.8400000000001s)]
*  documented foundational science. Um, it works. It was discovered out of cancer research dollars, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1875.1200000000001s)]
*  but if you actually look at the investment in women's health, it's, it's not there. And [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1882.16s)]
*  ovarian function, it's the least studied organ in the body, arguably the most important. None of us [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1886.88s)]
*  would be here without it. Right. Um, and, and so I started to fund the science and, and that's when [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1894.3200000000002s)]
*  I first came across transhumanism and transhumanism is very real. It's this idea that technology can [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1902.96s)]
*  replace human function. Um, and so I put a hundred million dollars in to understand how to make [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1912.48s)]
*  and keep healthy women healthy, but all of these transhumanists, all these transhumanists, right? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1920.08s)]
*  What a novel idea. Let's keep women healthy so that we can have healthy babies. Most important [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1926.8s)]
*  thing in the world. Um, but the transhumanists wanted to build artificial wombs with these [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1933.4399999999998s)]
*  grants. They wanted to study IVG, um, which is creating gametes eggs out of the human stem [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1943.6s)]
*  cells just from your skin. And there's a company, uh, called conception that actually just had mice [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1951.52s)]
*  give birth to five pups, um, with two male, uh, donors. And, and so, you know, I, it's very real [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1959.6s)]
*  transhumanists. I'm, I'm, I'm in Silicon Valley. I'm in tech. I see all this stuff daily. Um, and [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1970.1599999999999s)]
*  it made me question, you know, if we are at a time in human history where we have to pause to really [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1977.12s)]
*  think about where this is all going. And I was slowly being labeled anti-science as a result of [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1984.8s)]
*  that. Um, and then the pandemic hit and, and like many of us, the science didn't check out, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=1993.2s)]
*  didn't reconcile. So I met Bobby Kennedy and he bravely left the Democratic Party, something that [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2000.0s)]
*  like is really hard. It's really hard for a lot of us to do in his case. It was literally part of [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2008.56s)]
*  his genetics. Um, in my case, it was my upbringing and my programming, how I was raised. And so [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2019.6799999999998s)]
*  leaving the Democratic Party to run as a third party seemed like a healthy thing to do. I wasn't [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2028.3999999999999s)]
*  becoming Republican, right? God forbid. But I, um, that experiences when I realized how bad things [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2035.12s)]
*  are in this country. Republicans have out raised in terms of fundraising Democrats by about four to [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2050.3199999999997s)]
*  one, but they don't spend any of that money taking out third party candidates. Democrats do [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2058.48s)]
*  the amount of money they spend on undermining the things that make democracy, democracy. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2066.4s)]
*  They do it in ways that I could have never imagined. And I will tell you, they hide it very well [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2073.2s)]
*  from the Democratic Party base. And I feel that it is upon us to really tell the Democratic base [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2079.92s)]
*  what is going on. They're not bad people, but they are being told lies. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2087.92s)]
*  They're being told lies and they want to separate us and it's not right. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2101.36s)]
*  So you leave the Democratic Party, you go with Bobby Kennedy, you run independent, you see the [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2107.6s)]
*  party that you've spent your life in doing things you didn't know it was doing. At the same time, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2113.6800000000003s)]
*  you're being called anti-science for following the science of familiar experience, I think, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2117.68s)]
*  to most people here. But from there, it's still a huge leap in the mind of every sort of college [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2122.08s)]
*  educated affluent person I've ever met in California, which is a lot to be making an ad like that. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2131.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think it is such a jump. We're not glorifying Trump, but what we are trying to do [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2138.7999999999997s)]
*  right now is break through to individuals that have been programmed to see Donald Trump as a criminal. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2148.24s)]
*  I wouldn't actually know how to make an ad glorifying Trump, but what I can make an honest ad about [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2156.72s)]
*  is that we've been lied to about him. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2163.52s)]
*  I think that's absolutely right. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2168.0s)]
*  Can I just ask you one more question about transhumanism? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2173.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, go. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2175.9199999999996s)]
*  I wish we had like three hours to talk about this because I sent [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2176.72s)]
*  so much. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2180.16s)]
*  I sense it's the shape of the future and I sense it's maybe the scariest thing most people don't [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2187.2s)]
*  know enough about. How common are the views that you described, the horrifying Frankenstein-like [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2193.2s)]
*  views you described among Democratic donors and elites? [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2202.16s)]
*  It's pretty ubiquitous in the sense that many view it in the same light as vaccines. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2205.36s)]
*  So there's entire now platforms dedicated to basically mass printing vaccines where you put a virus in [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2213.36s)]
*  and they print it into any disease format, mRNA is the vehicle to deliver it, and they think that this is a massive success. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2221.36s)]
*  Vaccine injuries in this country have been vastly under-reported, and I also believe that behind it is this corporatist ideal on the world. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2233.36s)]
*  That corporatism amongst the Democratic elites is the only way towards progress, and that is a dead lie. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2243.36s)]
*  We have so much science we could be doing. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2253.36s)]
*  And transhumanism, if you want to hear my real take on it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2257.36s)]
*  I do actually, because I feel like we're getting really close to something important, really important. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2263.36s)]
*  Okay. So I'm a lover of philosophy, and I read a very important thing that made me understand transhumanism written by a philosopher, Peter Kingsley. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2269.36s)]
*  And it actually had me crying in my kitchen. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2281.36s)]
*  And I was like, where is justice in this world? I was really sad. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2285.36s)]
*  I was like, where is justice in this world? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2289.36s)]
*  And the ancient Greeks believed that justice is a goddess that you meet at the gates of the underworld. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2291.36s)]
*  And when you die, you go and you meet Lady Justice. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2301.36s)]
*  It's much like Purgatory and how the Bible explains it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2305.36s)]
*  But I read it in the context of the ancient Greeks. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2309.36s)]
*  And there justice determines whether you go to hell or heaven. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2313.36s)]
*  And it's described in incredible terms. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2319.36s)]
*  And Lady Justice is not someone you can lie or hide your misdeeds from. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2323.36s)]
*  And so I read this and I cry because I'm like, at least there is justice in the cosmos. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2329.36s)]
*  Might not be here right now. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2335.36s)]
*  We can fight for her as an archetype. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2337.36s)]
*  But the people who are afraid to die, they don't want to meet Lady Justice. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2340.36s)]
*  And that's what I think this transhumanism is all about. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2347.36s)]
*  I think it is a deep fear of death. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2352.36s)]
*  Well, that is profound. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2356.36s)]
*  And I think true. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2358.36s)]
*  And you did see this during COVID. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2360.36s)]
*  During COVID, the people I lived around during COVID had been forced to ask themselves, you know, no one wants to die. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2362.36s)]
*  I don't have no interest in dying at the moment. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2370.36s)]
*  But people were forced to ask themselves, like, is that the worst thing? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2372.36s)]
*  And the people who decided it wasn't the worst thing, it's worse to live on your knees, right? [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2376.36s)]
*  Those people had a joyful time during COVID. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2382.36s)]
*  And the people who decided that dying is the worst possible thing were the ones enforcing mask mandates and the VACs. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2385.36s)]
*  And you think that stems from the fact that they're afraid to die because they believe on some level there is justice. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2392.36s)]
*  I think they know viscerally what they're doing. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2398.36s)]
*  So how do you like to cut your cell phone bill in half every single month? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2401.36s)]
*  That's probably pretty high. Have you checked it recently? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2406.36s)]
*  Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile want you to believe that you have to have something called unlimited data. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2408.36s)]
*  And maybe you're in the small percentage that do need unlimited data, whatever that is. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2414.36s)]
*  But for most people, you do not need unlimited data and you certainly shouldn't be forced to pay for it. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2418.36s)]
*  That's where PureTalk comes in. PureTalk only charges you for the data that you want. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2424.36s)]
*  How about that? If you walked into an ice cream parlor and they said you can only buy 11 cones and you said, I just want one, you probably wouldn't go back, would you? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2428.36s)]
*  No, you go to the place that sold you what you wanted. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2437.36s)]
*  Talk, text and 5 gigs of data on PureTalk is 25 bucks a month. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2440.36s)]
*  How much is 5 gigs? Well, you can browse the Internet for 135 hours. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2446.36s)]
*  You can stream a thousand songs. You can watch 10 hours of video. So it's a lot, actually. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2450.36s)]
*  So stop overpaying for data you never use and switch to PureTalk and America's most dependable 5G network, 25 bucks a month. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2455.36s)]
*  PureTalk is proudly veteran led, supports American jobs with their whole customer service team right here in the United States. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2462.36s)]

*  Only buy what you need. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2495.36s)]
*  So how did this? I agree with you 100 percent. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2497.36s)]
*  Because you can run from eternal truths, but they reside within you like you know on an animal level that it's all real. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2501.36s)]
*  All that stuff is real. We all know that. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2508.36s)]
*  So how does God factor into this? So you've described the suffering, crying in your kitchen, reading philosophy. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2511.36s)]
*  By the way, that's something I've never done and I'm impressed that you have. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2517.36s)]
*  I'm reading like cereal boxes, but I'm impressed. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2520.36s)]
*  How did that suffering bring you to an understanding of God? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2523.36s)]
*  You know, I think that we are all put on this planet to learn things and see things in a very unique perspective. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2530.36s)]
*  I was living a very comfortable life in Silicon Valley. I was an early AI developer. I was a techno-optivist. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2543.36s)]
*  So my grief was also a very lonely period because no one around me could be someone I could trust with even this notion [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2553.36s)]
*  that perhaps the shot caused an adverse reaction. This is a no-go for progressives. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2581.36s)]
*  You cannot talk about these things amongst these communities. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2588.36s)]
*  And the loneliness plus COVID, because this happened around COVID too, led me to a place of utter destruction. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2593.36s)]
*  And I was alone in that process. And, you know, we don't have to talk about my ex-husband. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2605.36s)]
*  It's very therapeutic to be here. It's kind of like a therapy right now. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2613.36s)]
*  It's, you know, coming out of that completely alone with a child that you feel helpless to help is a position that either leads you to total hermitage or makes you a warrior, Mom. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2621.36s)]
*  So let me ask you one last question. And thank you for this. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2649.36s)]
*  Of course. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2654.36s)]
*  God bless you. I agree with that. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2655.36s)]
*  How do you think this ends, this period, this season? And are you hopeful? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2659.36s)]
*  I'm hopeful because of you. You. You, Annie. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2666.36s)]
*  I'm hopeful because I believe God is here. He's here. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2676.36s)]
*  And I believe that this country wants to heal right now more than anything. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2688.36s)]
*  And I believe that we can unite. I believe also that Donald Trump, minus some of his imperfections, is a guy who wants to take us along with him. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2696.36s)]
*  Nicole Shanahan, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2714.36s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you all. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2717.36s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2734.36s)]
*  That really is the beauty of this moment is being shocked by how much you have in common with people you didn't think you had anything in common with at all. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2737.36s)]
*  It was awesome. It was awesome. And it's happening all around us where people are deciding, you know, this is fake. Those categories are fake. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2749.36s)]
*  I'm going to tell the truth no matter what. And when you start people seeing people doing that, it just it gives you heart and hope. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2759.36s)]
*  So with that in mind, I want to introduce our second guest of the evening, who is someone who I've known for several years, who I think is one of the most impressive voices in the conversation. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2766.36s)]
*  One of the smartest, one of the toughest, one of the most interesting, one of the most original thinkers, a totally fearless person. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2776.36s)]
*  If you live in Texas because he lives in the state, he's very local, but I also think he is national. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2782.36s)]
*  You're familiar with him. And that is Jesse Kelly, my friend, who joins us now. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2789.36s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2796.36s)]
*  I'm so glad you're here. Thank you for having me in your state. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2812.36s)]
*  I'm glad you get to have me. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2816.36s)]
*  I have very embarrassing European style slippers on. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2818.36s)]
*  You're wearing ostrich skin boots and I've never felt more emasculated than I do now, but I'm going to push. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2822.36s)]
*  I'm going to push through it. I'm going to push through it. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2833.36s)]
*  All my cousins are wearing those boots and one of them just said me, do you have any boots? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2837.36s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm on the road, so I'm wearing my little slippers. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2843.36s)]
*  Anyway, thank you so much. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2847.36s)]
*  Now, listen, I need to explain before we get into it. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2850.36s)]
*  I don't know how to dress myself. I can't. I know fashion makes sense to some people. It does not make sense to me. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2854.36s)]
*  They tell me I'm supposed to match. I walk out in something that's matching and my wife says, is that what you're wearing? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2862.36s)]
*  Are you playing? I'm wearing that. And I'm like, they're both blue, right? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2867.36s)]
*  So she decided to simplify things for me and buy me one nice pair of boots. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2870.36s)]
*  One nice pair of boots is the only nice pair I own. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2874.36s)]
*  And now whenever I'm coming to do something like talk to Tucker Carlson and all these people, I put on my freaking boots. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2876.36s)]
*  Well, I think you're crushing it. I would never know you got dressed in the dark. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2882.36s)]
*  You're a very sensible wife. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2887.36s)]
*  So where do you think we are right now? Since you've got a daily show, you follow the stuff day in and day out. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2890.36s)]
*  Where are we right now in the presidential race, would you say? What's the truth of it? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2895.36s)]
*  Well, the truth of it is that they tried to murder Donald Trump twice because they think he's winning. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2901.36s)]
*  They wouldn't do that if they thought he was losing. Such a good point. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2906.36s)]
*  What we have in this country right now is it's something I call the system. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2914.36s)]
*  That's just like I'm an idiot. It's a word I came up with for people call it the regime. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2918.36s)]
*  You call it whatever you want. But what we have is nations are built on their institutions, right? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2922.36s)]
*  And your media institution, your religious institutions, your government institutions, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2927.36s)]
*  these are the institutions that determine the direction of your country. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2932.36s)]
*  And if your institutions are good, your country will be good because the institutions produce other people. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2936.36s)]
*  It's not about one person. Our institutions have been poisoned, poisoned for decades by communist filth. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2941.36s)]
*  And now they've taken over all the institutions. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2948.36s)]
*  I like your use of the phrase communist filth. It doesn't leave much to the imagination. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2952.36s)]
*  Well, that's what these people are. That's what these people are. They are vile. They are evil. They are demonic. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2957.36s)]
*  And you know, before I even continue with my institution thing, I just want to make sure you understand something. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2964.36s)]
*  You're the good guy. They are the bad guys. You are standing for things. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2970.36s)]
*  Look behind you right now and God is there. Family is there. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2976.36s)]
*  We are fighting against demons and therefore we will fight like we have to win because they cannot win. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2981.36s)]
*  They cannot ever be allowed to win. Be clear about that. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2987.36s)]
*  So once the institutions got completely taken over by communist filth because we ran out of money, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=2992.36s)]
*  and then we allowed these people to educate our children, we very naively sent children off to government schools for years [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3001.36s)]
*  thinking they were learning their ABCs when really they were learning to hate America. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3007.36s)]
*  America sucks. It's evil. You send your kid to kindergarten. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3012.36s)]
*  Now he comes home and talks about how we genocide of the Native Americans. But it's crazy. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3016.36s)]
*  So we've managed to poison all of these institutions and now we have a criminal integration system. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3020.36s)]
*  Our government is a criminal enterprise. It is. And criminal enterprises do what? To protect themselves. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3026.36s)]
*  Everyone has watched a movie or read a book about a criminal organization, the mafia. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3038.36s)]
*  What do they do when there's a threat? They kill. Corrupt systems kill. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3042.36s)]
*  They try to blow Donald Trump's head off twice because he threatens that. And all of us threaten that. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3046.36s)]
*  That's why they sent the FBI after school board moms. That's why they ran all the people out of the military who didn't want to get vaccinated. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3052.36s)]
*  The system is afraid and they lash out and they kill when they're afraid. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3059.36s)]
*  What gives me hope is the fear. And not because I'm for fear. I'm totally opposed to fear. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3064.36s)]
*  I'm not against fear. But fear suggests they know they're losing and there's not actually popular consent for this stuff. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3078.36s)]
*  I honestly don't think, maybe I'm deluding myself, that most Americans want what they're getting. Do you think? [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3085.36s)]
*  I think it depends on how we classify most Americans. Are we talking about people who simply reside here or new ones that they've imported into the country? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3092.36s)]
*  Because that's an important part. I wasn't trying to be glib. That's an important part and it's an important reason why the federal government has taken your money out of every single paycheck. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3101.36s)]
*  And they have flown and bused in foreigners into your country. They pay for their housing while you can't afford houses. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3111.36s)]
*  They pay for their eggs while you can't afford eggs. They take over your job at the factory for a fraction, for pennies on the dollar you were working for. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3119.36s)]
*  And then they will run ads on television telling you, these people are so much more hardworking than the dirtball Americans we just fired. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3127.36s)]
*  This is the greatest thing in the world. The propaganda would not be so heavy if they were comfortable in their position of power. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3133.36s)]
*  People think that these people are all powerful right now. They're the furthest thing from it. Otherwise they wouldn't still be lying. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3141.36s)]
*  They would just be showing up at your house in the middle of the night to shoot you in the face like they did in the Soviet Union. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3147.36s)]
*  They know they have to lie about every single thing and they're not even good at it. If you want to feel really great about something, we're up against a bunch of tubby losers without girlfriends. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3152.36s)]
*  Winner, it's not like we're facing warriors here. We're the warriors here. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3162.36s)]
*  The most interesting and newsworthy television show of the year is coming here to TCN. We are not bragging. That's actually true. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3166.36s)]
*  So our longtime producer Justin Wells and a team have been embedded with no publicity at all with Donald Trump on the campaign trail for months. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3174.36s)]
*  They're the only crew capturing what is going on on the campaign in real time intimately. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3184.36s)]
*  They're with Trump as he campaigns for the presidency across the country and they've shot some amazing footage. It shows you what it's really like in there. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3190.36s)]
*  So if you're a member, you will soon be able to get this docu-series covering the historic campaign, the fall of Joe Biden, never before seen footage from the assassination attempt at the Butler Township Pennsylvania Trump rally and a lot more. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3198.36s)]
*  It's going to pull back the curtain completely. They are embedded inside the campaign. I can't wait to see it personally. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3209.36s)]
*  But to get it first, go to tuckercarlson.com, become a member of the greatest television event of the year. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3215.36s)]
*  We're proud to offer it. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3223.36s)]
*  Do you have? I think that's right. I think that's why they're trying to take your guns. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3234.36s)]
*  There's a video that came out of Kamala Harris today from some years ago in California. She's staying right next to Gavin Newsom. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3241.36s)]
*  I use the word Gavin Newsom as if he's a human being. That has not been verified. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3249.36s)]
*  Whatever the kind of, you know, AI bot who's the governor of California. She's staying there and she said, you know, just because you have a gun legally, and I think I'm quoting in the sanctity of your own home doesn't mean we can't come in when we want to to check to see if you're using it the way we want you to. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3255.36s)]
*  So that of course is like a violation of the Bill of Rights. That's the definition of tyranny. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3273.36s)]
*  And I got to think they're so fixated on the gun question, not because they're against violence. They created violence in all of our cities, including your cities here in Texas, but because they don't trust the population. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3279.36s)]
*  I mean, is there any other explanation? No, they want to take your guns because they want to murder you like every evil government in the history of mankind. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3293.36s)]
*  And people can say that that's crazy. Open up a freaking history book. Governments, they'll disarm you and then they'll murder you. They'll disarm you and then they'll murder you. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3300.36s)]
*  And if you think that these... Wait a second. That's not on Wikipedia. That is not on Wikipedia. That's not what I read at all. I thought they were disarming you because you might hurt yourself. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3308.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And you know, this is where you can think if you're speaking to a normal person, like somebody who's not politically involved, they want the kids, school, watch the game on Sunday, and you start talking like this, they might look at you crazy or think that you're a wingnut because when they look at Kamala Harris or Christopher Wray or Merrick Garland with his weird voice, why does he talk like that? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3319.36s)]
*  And they think to themselves, well, he doesn't look like Stalin. He doesn't look like Mao. He doesn't... I'm here to tell you something right now. These people are so sick that kids will be dead in a school and without an ounce of shame, they will stand on the bodies of dead children before the shooter is even dead to take your guns. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3343.36s)]
*  And it's not because they've shed a single tear for a dead child in this country. It's because the dirty demons who want to hurt you lay awake at night dreaming about it, and they are so mad that they can't because we are the most armed freaking people on the planet. We have the guns, we have the ammo, and that's why they're mad. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3363.36s)]
*  I do think... I think you're on to something that they kind of figured out. I mean, they're not stupid, I will say that, and they kind of figured out that you can't give the game away really, you know, in an obvious way. You can't just show up in some Latin American military uniform and say it's a Junta now obey. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3385.36s)]
*  So you trot out this kind of drooling figure like Joe Biden to tell you, you know, it's just grandpa. You know, there's a lot of jello eating and misremembering, but it's not dangerous. And that worked for a while. And then he disappeared, which raises the obvious, like, where is he? Is he still president? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3403.36s)]
*  Well, he never was president. We all know that, and we never, we never was. The country is run by people like Susan Rice. It's run by all these vile little commies behind the scenes who they grew up worshipping Mao. We've heard all, at least some Monaco, all the people, all the Obama roster. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3421.36s)]
*  Joe Biden was never there. He would never made a single decision. He was never allowed to make a single decision. His gift was the presidency. He gets a presidential library. Dr. Jill can make half a million a speech on the lecture circuit once they cart poor Joe off to the nursing home. And that's the only reason he was never there at all. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3443.36s)]
*  But you're right about when they talk about guns, and that's why they trot out poor Joe and his favorite line is, well, I was out hunting. You don't need a 30 round magazine to kill deer. Well, the Second Amendment wasn't to kill deer. It was to kill tyrants. It wasn't even to kill robbers. It was to kill tyrants. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3461.36s)]
*  Well, then that, I mean, you're sort of getting it. And I didn't even want to bring this up because I, I find it so chilling, bone chilling, actually. But the most interesting fact from the debate was Kamala Harris admitting she has a gun. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3478.36s)]
*  And I'm as for Second Amendment rights as anybody. I mean, I'm, you know, more than anyone I know, actually, maybe other than you. But I don't think Kamala Harris should have a gun. I mean, that's why does Kamala Harris have a gun? Where did she get the gun? What kind of gun is it? What's the point of having the gun? And why is no one in the media asked? Do you know the answers to any of those questions? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3493.36s)]
*  Could you even imagine going to the range with that moron and putting a loaded gun in her hand? You know, she'd be the one that turns around from the firing line. It's jam. You know, you can see her doing it already off the bat. You know that she'd be that one. She'd be the one. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3513.36s)]
*  But was it a straw purchase? I mean, who gave Kamala Harris a gun? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3529.36s)]
*  Well, look, these commies are always trying. You see it with every Democrat who talks today. They're always trying to straddle this line, which is really Kamala Harris' specialty given her beginning. But she's...what? What? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3534.36s)]
*  I'm so pure I didn't get your joke. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3556.36s)]
*  So, when you're an American Democrat now, this doesn't apply to older Democrats at all. Like, oh, this is not the 1960s. If you're a Democrat today, a Democrat politician, you're a communist. And you're trying to walk, you're constantly trying to straddle this line where you're trying not to freak out the older, you know, older union Democrat guy. Maybe he's a firefighter forever, fought for this country. Doesn't really like Republicans, but loves America. Right? Fourth of July, he's out there, hand over his heart, laying to the ground. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3561.36s)]
*  He loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he loves America, he [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3591.36s)]

*  Then they'll catch onto the game that the Democrat parties change completely. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3652.36s)]
*  So I'm sitting listening to this and literally my first thought was if Texas ever goes blue, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3655.78s)]
*  you're going to jail, man, you're on the list. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3661.54s)]
*  Um, yeah well, he's definitely going to jail if Texas goes blue. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3664.46s)]
*  And it would be a shame it would be one of the great shames in American history, because [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3672.6400000000003s)]
*  this is above all in addition to being prosperous and beautiful, it's a really nice state. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3675.6800000000003s)]
*  That's just nice. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3680.12s)]
*  And when you come here, you really notice it if you come from other places. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3681.6s)]
*  Just the kindness that Texans show each other is amazing to watch. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3687.44s)]
*  And you'd hate that to be lost. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3692.22s)]
*  And it would be lost, I think, as it has been in the state that I grew up in, which is a [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3694.18s)]
*  state of people who are really suspicious of each other and mad at each other. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3697.8399999999997s)]
*  And I wouldn't want that for you at all. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3702.16s)]
*  I mean it. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3703.56s)]
*  Do you think that this state is moving toward control of the Democratic Party? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3705.08s)]
*  It will be up to the people of the state. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3710.84s)]
*  And I know that sounds like the most cliché answer in the world. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3712.6s)]
*  It does, yeah, for sure. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3715.56s)]
*  I know that was a walking cliché. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3716.56s)]
*  Let me explain. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3719.84s)]
*  What we have right now, we already talked about the people who run things, but what [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3721.6s)]
*  we have on the other side is what I like to call the low TGOP. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3725.4s)]
*  The Republicans, they're useless. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3730.68s)]
*  They don't stand up for you ever. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3732.32s)]
*  They always pretend like they're going to, and then they go, well, we can't, we've got [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3734.14s)]
*  to wait until the next election. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3737.22s)]
*  And well, you're clapping, but you're not going to like this next part. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3739.62s)]
*  You know whose fault that is? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3742.9s)]
*  Our fault. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3744.74s)]
*  It's our fault, and I point fingers at myself, too. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3745.8799999999997s)]
*  You mentioned the state of Texas here. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3748.22s)]
*  This state should already, already, right now, they should already be reorienting the [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3750.42s)]
*  state police, Texas Rangers, to stand as a bulwark between Texans and the federal government [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3756.06s)]
*  that is evil. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3761.7s)]
*  The state should already be doing that. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3762.7s)]
*  But instead, we have John freaking Cornyn as the senator. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3771.3399999999997s)]
*  And this is what I mean. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3779.46s)]
*  We need, and the sad part is this isn't going to be applicable to any one of the thousands [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3781.66s)]
*  of people who showed up to watch Tucker Carlson tonight. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3786.4199999999996s)]
*  But we have a primary voter problem because the reddest states, they are sending the most [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3789.26s)]
*  putrid losers to Washington, D.C. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3796.26s)]
*  John Thune, John Cornyn, Mitch McConnell. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3798.94s)]
*  What is that? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3802.7400000000002s)]
*  James Langford, Naked Ken Doll Langford out of Oklahoma. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3803.7400000000002s)]
*  These people are from our reddest states. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3807.2200000000003s)]
*  Wait, what did you call him? [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3809.1000000000004s)]
*  Naked Ken Doll. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3810.86s)]
*  Have you ever seen a Naked Ken Doll? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3811.86s)]
*  There's no, there's no, nothing there. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3812.86s)]
*  No, I'm not bragging. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3815.46s)]
*  I've never taken off Ken's pants, but it's just. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3817.6600000000003s)]
*  Well, believe me, that's what you're going to find if you ever disobey James Langford. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3820.98s)]
*  But the point is, the point is, we do, we have this red state and because it is red, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3825.5s)]
*  look I moved here on purpose. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3831.86s)]
*  My wife and I, we had two kids. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3833.1800000000003s)]
*  I moved here without a job because I love Texas people so much because that's what we [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3834.6600000000003s)]
*  do. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3840.26s)]
*  But, but that niceness can also burn us as well because you move to a safe place. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3841.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm in a neighborhood without crime. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3847.46s)]
*  I'm in a state that's Republican. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3849.0200000000004s)]
*  I have this, I have that. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3850.82s)]
*  And you think to yourself, we're fine. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3852.42s)]
*  We're not fine. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3854.42s)]
*  The demons come for what is good. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3855.42s)]
*  What is good. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3858.5400000000004s)]
*  It's not an accident. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3859.5400000000004s)]
*  If you've ever sat at home and you watched any of this child tranny stuff or anything [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3860.5400000000004s)]
*  like that before and you've ever said something to yourself like, why the kids? [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3864.2200000000003s)]
*  Why can't they just leave the kids alone? [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3868.0s)]
*  People love saying that on the right. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3870.16s)]
*  I don't understand why they can't leave the kids alone. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3871.44s)]
*  The kids are where they went first because the kids are the most good. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3873.72s)]
*  Because the kids are the most innocent. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3877.8399999999997s)]
*  They're not going to come after me. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3879.16s)]
*  I'm a horrible human being. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3880.64s)]
*  The kids are the most innocent and so that's why they went after them. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3882.24s)]
*  Whatever is good, whatever is right, that's what the devil goes after first. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3887.0s)]
*  And if you think, if you think your state of Texas is safe, it's the most unsafe because [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3891.7799999999997s)]
*  these people look at you and your family and your values and your guns and it's a reminder [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3898.0800000000004s)]
*  of everything they're not. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3903.0600000000004s)]
*  And it's a reminder of everything that can stop them. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3904.92s)]
*  So we're not safe and we have to start getting more involved locally and in primaries. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3907.54s)]
*  It is a disgrace that John Cornyn is a senator from this state. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3912.88s)]
*  That should never happen again. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3916.44s)]
*  Disgrace. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3918.44s)]
*  Wow. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3919.44s)]
*  That is a really deep analysis. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3920.44s)]
*  It's the purity. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3924.5600000000004s)]
*  It's the desire to defile purity that drives them. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3926.96s)]
*  Anything that is beautiful, anything that is unsullied, anything that is sincere, they [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3931.44s)]
*  hate. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3936.16s)]
*  And I have to say, it's true, you really notice it. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3937.36s)]
*  And you know with art and architecture, it's why they destroy nature. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3939.56s)]
*  It's why they put up wind farms on the top of mountains. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3943.76s)]
*  But Texas does seem, I'm just being totally honest, the single most left wing, truly left [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3947.6s)]
*  wing member of Congress I've ever met personally is a Republican from this area who has no [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3955.24s)]
*  interest in the United States whatsoever and does not even pretend. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3960.68s)]
*  I'm not going to name names. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3964.04s)]
*  Oh, I think that's right. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3965.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's Dan Crenshaw, the most liberal, most left wing person I've ever met in the [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3967.68s)]
*  Congress. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3973.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm just being serious. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3974.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't, I mean structurally, how does that happen? [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3975.3599999999997s)]
*  It happens because we don't go beyond as, this is not going to apply to the people in [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3980.64s)]
*  the room because you're the hyper informed. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3986.56s)]
*  You don't understand how much more informed you are than your neighbor that you didn't [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3988.3199999999997s)]
*  invite tonight. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3992.52s)]
*  I really mean that. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3993.52s)]
*  Your brother, your mom, yes, they're Republican, they're voting Republican. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3994.8399999999997s)]
*  They probably have a MAGA hat on. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3997.8399999999997s)]
*  Go Trump! [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=3999.2s)]
*  Ask them. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4000.2s)]
*  Ask them when the last time they voted in a school board election was. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4001.2s)]
*  Ask them if they even voted in a primary election. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4005.08s)]
*  We don't do it because we're in a safe, comfortable place. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4008.6s)]
*  And so, and this happens everywhere. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4012.52s)]
*  It happens in Wyoming. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4013.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like the reddest state in the union. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4014.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not unique to Texas. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4016.16s)]
*  These are, if you're a scumbag communist and you want to get elected in a place like Wyoming, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4017.92s)]
*  you can't run as a Democrat. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4023.08s)]
*  You can't run as a hard lefty. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4024.44s)]
*  You throw on some cowboy boots and you buy a shotgun and go out there and take a picture [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4026.12s)]
*  shooting at some pheasants and you learn how to speak the lingo a little bit, watch a little [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4030.68s)]
*  bit of Tucker Carlson. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4034.98s)]
*  Now you know what to say, how to deceive exactly, and you find yourself in a position of power [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4036.38s)]
*  kneecapping people on the right time after time after time. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4042.34s)]
*  Our controlled opposition problem is so bad and that's why we always feel like we're playing [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4047.1s)]
*  tug of war with Whoopi Goldberg. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4051.98s)]
*  It just doesn't feel like you can win. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4053.94s)]
*  It's so true. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4056.98s)]
*  Wyoming is the most Republican state in the United States, with the exception of Teton [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4059.38s)]
*  County, every county is Republican, and they elected Liz Cheney who just endorsed Kamala [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4063.18s)]
*  Harris time and time again. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4070.18s)]
*  I noticed something today that I wanted to ask you about. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4073.94s)]
*  So there's this new list that Democrats are bragging about of Republican national security [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4076.34s)]
*  officials that have endorsed Kamala Harris. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4082.78s)]
*  And on the list, it's all Bush-Cheney people. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4088.2400000000002s)]
*  The architects of the Iraq war. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4091.14s)]
*  But on the list is the chairman of the 9-11 commission who's responsible for the 9-11 [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4094.06s)]
*  report, and who's now at University of Virginia as a professor, but really a guy who I think [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4101.14s)]
*  probably should answer some questions. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4106.66s)]
*  And you wonder how much of the resistance to Trump, who's not like a, he's a pretty [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4109.1s)]
*  moderate guy actually, but in Washington he's hated more than anyone's ever been hated. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4114.42s)]
*  And I always have wondered how much of that hatred stems from fear that he might declassify [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4119.3s)]
*  documents that implicate the crimes of the most corrupt city in the atmosphere, which [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4125.1s)]
*  is D.C. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4131.860000000001s)]
*  Do you think that's a driving, motivating force? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4133.42s)]
*  I actually think you nailed it completely. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4137.38s)]
*  I think it ties directly to foreign policy, actually Trump's foreign policy, because for [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4139.9400000000005s)]
*  the longest time Democrats and Republicans for most of my life have really had pretty [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4144.98s)]
*  much the same foreign policy. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4149.74s)]
*  It's really a worship of the state. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4152.46s)]
*  It's what it's always been. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4154.139999999999s)]
*  Ours has looked different than theirs, but we always trusted the FBI. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4155.339999999999s)]
*  I wanted to work for the FBI when I was a kid. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4159.379999999999s)]
*  Oh my gosh, the FBI. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4161.46s)]
*  I didn't know it was the Stasi, or at least it was turning that way. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4162.78s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4165.58s)]
*  We had no idea about these things. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4166.86s)]
*  And Trump comes in, and like you mentioned, he's not some hardcore righty. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4169.179999999999s)]
*  He's a fairly moderate guy when you look at his views, but he has a very different view [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4173.5s)]
*  on foreign policy. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4178.46s)]
*  And so when you think about foreign policy, think about, look, we can just make it about [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4180.5s)]
*  Ukraine. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4183.78s)]
*  It doesn't really matter what you think about that. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4184.78s)]
*  The amount of money, taxpayer money, it goes from the taxpayer, it goes into the government. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4186.58s)]
*  The government writes gigantic checks of your money to the defense contractors. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4193.9s)]
*  The defense contractors get paid hugely to continue that war without end. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4198.1s)]
*  The defense contractors also take that very same money and hand it right back to the politician [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4204.660000000001s)]
*  who stole it from you, and now all this stuff seems to be working in a great cycle. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4208.780000000001s)]
*  And now when you tie in the finance giants, who they've already promised big, fat taxpayer-funded [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4213.740000000001s)]
*  checks to rebuild, of course, when the whole thing's done, what you finally wake up and [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4218.900000000001s)]
*  figure out is the evil demons who run the country look at all of us like just one big [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4223.58s)]
*  tax farm so they can stay in power, so they can have their state dinners, so all this [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4228.54s)]
*  stuff can work out. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4233.9800000000005s)]
*  And that Bush-Cheney wing, they were the freaking worst about all that stuff. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4234.9800000000005s)]
*  They were awful about all that. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4239.7s)]
*  And Trump challenging that, I will always believe Trump challenging that is the reason [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4242.06s)]
*  they're trying to murder him so bad, because that is the most money. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4248.62s)]
*  You follow the money, there's your answer. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4251.74s)]
*  I think you've got to be right. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4254.0599999999995s)]
*  By the way, you served in the Marine Corps during that period. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4255.46s)]
*  You did the patriotic thing. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4258.66s)]
*  Now they hate you. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4262.099999999999s)]
*  But it's just, it doesn't make any sense otherwise, because here you have Dick Cheney and Philip [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4263.179999999999s)]
*  Zellekow, the guy who ran the 9-11 commission, endorsing the administration that armed the [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4269.46s)]
*  Taliban. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4276.0599999999995s)]
*  So, like, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4277.0599999999995s)]
*  If you were the leader of the war on terror, as Cheney was, or Philip Zellekow was, or [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4279.96s)]
*  Bob Zellek was, you hate the Taliban. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4285.0s)]
*  That's what you told us. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4289.08s)]
*  How could you possibly endorse the Biden-Harris administration, which just armed the Taliban? [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4290.44s)]
*  It's not the best armed army in the region, thanks to the Biden-Harris administration, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4296.24s)]
*  which you're now for. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4302.8s)]
*  So it actually wasn't about fighting a global war on terror, obviously. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4304.5s)]
*  It's about keeping your crimes hidden, and you're worried that if Trump gets elected, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4309.76s)]
*  he might just be crazy enough to declassify the documents that show what you've been doing [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4314.12s)]
*  for the last 25 years. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4319.68s)]
*  I don't see any other explanation. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4322.0s)]
*  I agree with you, standing up and cheering. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4329.08s)]
*  That is right. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4331.04s)]
*  No, look, what we're missing, and this happens to so many countries. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4332.04s)]
*  Sorry, Tucker, I'm going to filibuster for a second. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4337.4400000000005s)]
*  Dude, go crazy. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4339.82s)]
*  So what's happening in this country right now is what's happened to almost every single [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4341.82s)]
*  country in the history of the world, where you get far enough away from your founding. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4347.18s)]
*  The people who lead the country will lose a sense of duty to the country, and it just [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4352.42s)]
*  becomes about them. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4358.18s)]
*  Look, I could point to America's history, the Battle of Kenne, any historians here. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4359.74s)]
*  The second Punic War, Hannibal, you've heard of him, he fights the Romans, he ends up wiping [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4364.78s)]
*  out a Roman army. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4368.74s)]
*  A fascinating story about the Roman army, Hannibal wipes out, in Italy is, he takes [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4369.74s)]
*  out a huge chunk of the Roman Senate. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4374.94s)]
*  Wait a minute, senators on the battlefield dying beside the peasants? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4378.26s)]
*  Yes, that's how nations are supposed to operate, because the elite don't live on private jets [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4383.58s)]
*  and in steak houses. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4388.98s)]
*  If there was a war to be fought, you pick up your sword and you go die right next to [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4390.38s)]
*  the construction worker. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4394.9s)]
*  That's how it's supposed to work. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4396.48s)]
*  But if you look at that towards the end of Rome and where we are now, our leaders never [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4399.42s)]
*  go die, and their kids never go die. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4406.46s)]
*  You mentioned Republicans. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4408.62s)]
*  Wait a second, you were in the Marine Corps enlisted during the war on terror. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4409.62s)]
*  Was Liz Cheney with you? [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4412.58s)]
*  I not only didn't see Liz Cheney with me, I didn't happen to see Mitt Romney or any [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4414.5s)]
*  one of his 57 kids, and Mitt Romney to this day wants to invade every single place on [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4418.9s)]
*  the planet. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4424.46s)]
*  Again, I'm fine with differences on foreign policy, but I know what it's like to sit [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4425.46s)]
*  there and watch some kid hug his dad on the tarmac and say, Daddy, don't go. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4430.82s)]
*  Daddy, don't go. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4435.62s)]
*  And to know that these scumbags in DC constantly send our guys, our men and women to go do [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4436.62s)]
*  this without an ounce of duty to send themselves or their kids along makes me freaking sick. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4442.74s)]
*  And it's because they don't have a sense of duty. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4450.42s)]
*  We have gotten so far from where we are. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4462.8s)]
*  Our leaders now, they're just a bunch of bank robbers looting the treasury instead of people [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4465.58s)]
*  who see themselves as what they should see themselves as, as the Knights protecting Western [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4471.02s)]
*  civilization. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4477.02s)]
*  That's why they've sent the FBI after so many American citizens. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4478.22s)]
*  They've slowly turned their guns inward because now when these people wake up in the morning [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4481.860000000001s)]
*  and when they go to sleep at night, they think the enemy is you. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4486.66s)]
*  They don't stress about China. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4490.18s)]
*  They don't stress about Russia. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4491.68s)]
*  They don't stress about terror. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4492.9800000000005s)]
*  They certainly don't stress about the newest rapist dirtball that they hauled into this [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4494.38s)]
*  country across the border. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4498.06s)]
*  They don't care about your cat that got eaten in Ohio. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4499.64s)]
*  They don't care about any of that stuff. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4502.360000000001s)]
*  They wake up and they think about you, you with your rights and you want your freedom [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4504.42s)]
*  of speech and you probably love guns too and you're probably going to hold them to account [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4509.18s)]
*  if they continue to take a steaming dump on the country. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4513.7s)]
*  That's why they flooded this country with illegals and that's why they sent the FBI [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4516.9s)]
*  after school board moms. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4521.2s)]
*  So just to be clear, like for the record, because I don't think I was joking before, [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4523.82s)]
*  I don't think Wikipedia is the final word on history. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4531.42s)]
*  I just don't think that. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4533.9400000000005s)]
*  Your cat really did get eaten in Ohio, didn't he? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4535.9s)]
*  That is real, isn't it? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4540.1s)]
*  Well Tucker, look, I'm an American and I don't own a cat. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4541.34s)]
*  All right, I own a dog. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4544.46s)]
*  What? [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4547.46s)]
*  No, no, I would never own a cat. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4548.46s)]
*  You see, if you're wondering why I'm such a messed up human being, I have a lot of unrecognized [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4553.54s)]
*  child trauma that involved my cat getting run over by a school bus in front of me. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4558.66s)]
*  It's just right there in front of me and after that, my dad wasn't that nice about it and [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4562.98s)]
*  I decided I didn't want any more cats anymore. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4566.78s)]
*  Fair, fair. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4568.94s)]
*  But getting run over by a school bus is qualitatively different than being eaten by an illegal alien. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4570.46s)]
*  I do think that. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4574.86s)]
*  Both traumatic, one more traumatic than the other. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4577.26s)]
*  I guess it all depends on which party's eaten. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4578.86s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4580.94s)]
*  So we began the evening, I did it on purpose because I feel so overwhelmed with sadness [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4582.5599999999995s)]
*  by everything that's happening to the country that we love and we're born in and a country [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4588.5199999999995s)]
*  our ancestors built over many years with great effort and determination and foresight. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4593.839999999999s)]
*  Planting trees they would never see grow, you know, doing things that they would never [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4600.4s)]
*  benefit from and they knew they would never benefit from them but they knew that their [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4605.32s)]
*  grandchildren would and they did them. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4608.2s)]
*  And that's the most virtuous kind of behavior in my opinion. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4611.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's so sad to watch all this. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4613.299999999999s)]
*  And so I wanted to start on a note of hope which I think is real actually. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4616.2s)]
*  Do you feel any hope? [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4620.48s)]
*  And if so, why? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4623.38s)]
*  Oh, we're going to win. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4624.38s)]
*  We're going to win. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4627.04s)]
*  I know that you're afraid. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4634.46s)]
*  I get afraid. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4637.8s)]
*  I know you're sad. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4639.16s)]
*  I'm sad. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4641.12s)]
*  I love this place. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4643.24s)]
*  I would die for it. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4644.28s)]
*  It hurts watching these people tear it up. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4647.5599999999995s)]
*  I know it hurts but I'm here to tell you something. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4650.0s)]
*  They're more afraid than you are. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4654.48s)]
*  They're afraid we're going to wake up. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4656.96s)]
*  They're afraid we're going to get involved. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4660.0s)]
*  They're afraid we're going to go to their little fiefdoms of power at the local library [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4662.32s)]
*  or Congress or school board, wherever it is, and take their power away from them. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4666.679999999999s)]
*  They're afraid of you speaking the way you want to speak on social media. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4671.48s)]
*  They're afraid of the fact that you're guns. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4674.799999999999s)]
*  The demons are more afraid of you than you are of them. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4676.96s)]
*  The darkness is afraid of the light. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4681.679999999999s)]
*  The light does not fear the darkness. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4684.04s)]
*  And they should be afraid. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4689.12s)]
*  I want to make sure I'm very crystal clear about that and you can clip it all day long [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4693.44s)]
*  you commie scumbags. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4697.4s)]
*  Don't knock on my freaking door. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4698.84s)]
*  They should be afraid because as I mentioned in the beginning, they are wrong. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4702.12s)]
*  They are evil. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4710.24s)]
*  What they want is awful for this country. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4711.76s)]
*  What you want is wonderful and good. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4714.32s)]
*  We want a country surrounded by family and community. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4716.76s)]
*  A country led by God and decent people. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4721.22s)]
*  We want to be led by people who are better than what we have now. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4724.52s)]
*  And if we stand up, and I see it happening everywhere, we can have that. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4729.200000000001s)]
*  It is time to stop being afraid like you are and like I am and it is time to start making [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4734.040000000001s)]
*  them afraid. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4739.92s)]
*  Good guys don't get afraid. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4741.120000000001s)]
*  They need to be ones that are afraid of us and we can do that. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4743.0s)]
*  There's a new sheriff in town, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4746.400000000001s)]

*  Thank you. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4hoNaxVSwA&t=4751.52s)]
