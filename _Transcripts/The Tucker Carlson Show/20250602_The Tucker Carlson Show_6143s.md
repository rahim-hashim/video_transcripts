# Bishop Barron on the New Pope, the Foolishness of Atheism, and Why Young Men Are Turning to Christ
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0)
*  Do you think that Christian persecution is on the rise? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=0.0s)]
*  Oh, I know it is. It's documented. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3.36s)]
*  20th century was the worst century for Christian martyrs of Christian history, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5.32s)]
*  all the previous centuries combined. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=9.0s)]
*  It's the most persecuted religion. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=10.44s)]
*  If two friends like each other, that's fine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  But Aristotle says that won't last, that relationship. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=15.48s)]
*  What makes it last is when the two friends together [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=18.72s)]
*  fall in love with a transcendent third. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=21.76s)]
*  And now together we look to that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=23.96s)]
*  Now we really find a bond. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=26.44s)]
*  When the bride and groom together look to Christ, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  now they'll stay married. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=31.48s)]
*  If they're just looking to each other, it'll founder. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  The Catholic Church got super liberal, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=36.0s)]
*  and then all of a sudden everywhere you look, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  people you know are converting to Catholicism [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=39.92s)]
*  with a pretty kind of traditionally Christian orientation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=42.16s)]
*  This is how I would characterize ecclesial liberalism, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=45.2s)]
*  a tendency to reduce the supernatural to the natural. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=48.2s)]
*  That was going on for a long time, yes. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=50.8s)]
*  In very recent years, there's been a keener interest in [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=52.96s)]
*  the supernatural dimension of the faith. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=57.32s)]
*  ["The Supernatural Dimension of the Faith"] [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=60.04s)]
*  I don't think I've ever received more texts [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=80.56s)]
*  about any guest than I did about you. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=82.88s)]
*  From Catholics I know, from non-Catholics I know, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=87.72s)]
*  but the Catholics all wanted to hear details on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=89.96s)]
*  factions within the church, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  and I'm not gonna ask you any questions about that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=94.8s)]
*  because I don't understand any of it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=96.08s)]
*  I wanna start as broad as I possibly can, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=98.16s)]
*  which is it seems like a lot of people in the West [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=100.11999999999999s)]
*  are unhappy in its measurable suicide rates [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=102.72s)]
*  at record highs and birth rates at record lows. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  And those are not signs of confidence in the future, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=111.19999999999999s)]
*  those are signs of despair. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Why are people unhappy? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=115.72s)]
*  Well, they've lost a sense of God. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  I mean, God is the supreme good, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  and when you lose that sense of God [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=121.68s)]
*  and you collapse back in on yourself, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  that's St. Augustine, he defined sin as [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=125.80000000000001s)]
*  crevatus in se, I'm caved in around myself. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=128.72s)]
*  When you do that, you are by definition unhappy. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=132.68s)]
*  When you lose a sense of objective value [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=136.08s)]
*  grounded in the supreme value of God, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  almost again, by definition, you become unhappy. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=141.08s)]
*  What does it mean to cave in on yourself? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=144.32s)]
*  It means that you've lost a sense of connection [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=146.07999999999998s)]
*  to the values that should be calling you out of yourself [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=148.44s)]
*  in an act of love, and you've now come to reverence [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=151.28s)]
*  your own freedom, your own autonomy. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=154.72s)]
*  So what gives my life meaning is the fact [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=157.2s)]
*  that I've chosen something, I've determined my life. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=159.79999999999998s)]
*  If the Bible has one message, it's that, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  that when you live your life that way, you get lost. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=166.4s)]
*  When you deify your own psyche, your own ego, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=170.0s)]
*  you get lost. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=173.72s)]
*  The joy of life comes from forgetting [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=175.56s)]
*  in this great ecstatic act, you forget about yourself [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=177.68s)]
*  and you lose yourself in some great value. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  Now that could be sports, that could be politics, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  whatever it is, but then the supreme value [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=185.88s)]
*  in which all the other ones participate, we call God. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=188.44s)]
*  God is the highest good, the sumum bonum. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=191.68s)]
*  That's why you love the Lord your God. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=194.4s)]
*  That's the first commandment, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=195.88s)]
*  But when the cultures lost that, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=197.8s)]
*  which ours is in danger of, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=199.56s)]
*  you by definition become unhappy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  You get caved in around yourself, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=204.12s)]
*  and then you fuss around in this kind of addictive way. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=206.4s)]
*  That's how I would diagnose the thing spiritually. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  When you are in love with the idea of choices, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=213.56s)]
*  I thought the whole point of the West was choices. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=217.28s)]
*  Well, but you have to know what your choice is for. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=220.16s)]
*  When you deify choice itself, when you say autonomy, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=222.68s)]
*  that's my God. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=226.88s)]
*  No, choice is for some good. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=228.84s)]
*  And the idea is to order freedom, right? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=231.32s)]
*  Freedom is not an end in itself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=234.88s)]
*  Freedom is ordered towards some good. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=236.2s)]
*  When it's disordered, it tends to collapse upon itself. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=238.6s)]
*  That's what we got. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=242.28s)]
*  The whole point of America, I thought, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=243.32s)]
*  was choice and freedom for its own sake. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=244.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, and I would argue it's not for its own sake. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=247.0s)]
*  And if that happens to us, something's gone wrong. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=249.24s)]
*  The founding fathers, they weren't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=252.76s)]
*  in the full sense of the term. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=255.35999999999999s)]
*  It wouldn't have the full Catholic imagination [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=257.12s)]
*  as I would like it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=259.6s)]
*  But they certainly had a sense of the objective good [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=261.0s)]
*  and that the purpose of life is to find that good [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=265.0s)]
*  and be ordered toward it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=267.04s)]
*  And ordered freedom is what they're interested in, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=268.84s)]
*  not freedom for its own sake. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=271.4s)]
*  What does ordered mean? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=272.96s)]
*  Ordered toward the good. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=273.88s)]
*  And that's why it has to be educated. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=275.36s)]
*  Your freedom has to be disciplined and directed. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=277.4s)]
*  It's like a kid with all kinds of athletic ability, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=281.24s)]
*  but if a coach never directs that ability [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=283.56s)]
*  toward the achievement of some good, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=285.56s)]
*  that he can become a great tennis player or a great golfer, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=288.56s)]
*  then the freedom begins to just kind of stew on itself. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  No, direct freedom, direct talent, direct energy. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=295.52s)]
*  And our culture, see, it's like, I think of this, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=299.03999999999996s)]
*  if you have banks to a river, the river has energy. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=302.68s)]
*  It's going somewhere. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=305.64s)]
*  You knock down the banks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=306.96s)]
*  You say, oh, I don't want to be limited. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=308.32s)]
*  Don't set limits to my freedom. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=309.64s)]
*  It just floods the fields. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=311.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, it just opens up in this big, lazy lake [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=312.44s)]
*  and everyone's just sort of lying [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=315.0s)]
*  on their air mattresses, right? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=316.32s)]
*  Now, I'll tolerate you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=317.8s)]
*  You tolerate me. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=319.0s)]
*  I won't bother you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=319.84000000000003s)]
*  But then we're not getting anywhere. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=321.0s)]
*  The point of the banks is not to restrict me, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=322.72s)]
*  is to direct me, see, towards some good. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=325.36s)]
*  Well, religion has played that role for much of our history [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=328.2s)]
*  and in the measure that religion gets marginalized [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  and in the measure that we deify our autonomy, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  welcome to the unhappy world [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  that many of the young people are living in, sadly. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=339.0s)]
*  Deify our autonomy. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=341.72s)]
*  So you're speaking as if autonomy and choice [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=344.04s)]
*  are the same thing or closely related. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=348.16s)]
*  See, the goal for the Bible is not autonomy. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=350.16s)]
*  It's theonomy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=353.04s)]
*  God, theos, becomes the nomos. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=354.88s)]
*  God becomes the law of my life. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=357.24s)]
*  And see, here's the trick. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  When God becomes the norm of my life, I become more myself. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=361.88s)]
*  I find who I really am. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=366.28000000000003s)]
*  If I jettison God and I say, no, autonomy, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=369.04s)]
*  it's I'm the leader of my own life. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=371.64000000000004s)]
*  I get lost, right? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=373.36s)]
*  What does Jesus say? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=374.84000000000003s)]
*  The one who loses himself will find it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=375.68s)]
*  The one who's trying to hang on to himself [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  is gonna lose it. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=381.8s)]
*  Lose your freedom in God's greater freedom [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=384.04s)]
*  and you become now authentically free. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=386.92s)]
*  That's every spiritual master in the West [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=389.64s)]
*  teaches that lesson. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=391.68s)]
*  But we lose it in the measure that we say, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=392.96000000000004s)]
*  no, it's all about my autonomy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=394.76s)]
*  That's all that matters. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=396.16s)]
*  Don't tell me what to do. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=397.56s)]
*  Throw off the rules. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=398.76s)]
*  Right, knock down the banks [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=400.24s)]
*  and the river becomes a lazy lake. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=401.64s)]
*  And we tolerate each other blandly, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=403.4s)]
*  but we don't have a common purpose. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  That's another problem. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=408.32s)]
*  See, if you reject objective value, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  so you got your values, I got my values, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  your freedom, my freedom. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=414.52s)]
*  Well, what connects us? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=416.08s)]
*  In fact, we're antagonistic to each other, right? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=417.64s)]
*  We tend to grow into hostility [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=420.12s)]
*  and my freedom's against your freedom. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=421.52s)]
*  But if together we find a common good, a common goal, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=423.28s)]
*  now we can join forces, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=427.88s)]
*  So it's falling in love, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=430.0s)]
*  that's Aristotle with the transcendent third. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=431.72s)]
*  So like if two friends like each other, that's fine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=435.52s)]
*  But Aristotle says that won't last that relationship. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=439.64s)]
*  What makes it last is when the two friends together [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=442.92s)]
*  fall in love with the transcendent third, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=445.92s)]
*  the country or their philosophy or some great value. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=448.4s)]
*  And now together we look to that. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=452.16s)]
*  Now we really find a bond. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=454.84s)]
*  Go back now to the 1950s and Fulton Sheen, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=457.8s)]
*  the great Catholic preacher, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=460.32s)]
*  writes a book called Three to Get Married, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=461.24s)]
*  made the same argument, right? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=463.68s)]
*  The three are the bride, the groom and Christ. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=465.12s)]
*  When the bride and groom together look to Christ, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=468.24s)]
*  now they'll stay married. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  If they're just looking to each other, it'll founder. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=472.36s)]
*  What are the banks that we've demolished? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=477.44s)]
*  Well, I would say objective value. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=480.8s)]
*  The life of the mind, the moral good, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=483.4s)]
*  religious good, aesthetic, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=487.2s)]
*  think of the good, the true and the beautiful. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=489.4s)]
*  If we subjectivize those and just relativize them, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=491.4s)]
*  you got yours, I got mine, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=494.64s)]
*  what you think is right, I think is wrong. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=496.28000000000003s)]
*  When that's lost, the banks are knocked down. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=499.12s)]
*  But when together, oh no, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=501.6s)]
*  we can together reverence the beautiful, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=503.24s)]
*  we can together reverence the moral good, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=506.64s)]
*  we can together reverence the epistemological good, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=508.76s)]
*  the intellectual good, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=511.92s)]
*  then together we move someplace. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=514.1600000000001s)]
*  And see, our whole system educationally [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=516.4s)]
*  was set up classically to do just that, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=518.84s)]
*  was to train people in what these objectivities are. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  But when you subjectivize those [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=526.24s)]
*  or you see it simply as part of an oppressive [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=527.84s)]
*  or patriarchal system, you know, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=530.6800000000001s)]
*  why read Shakespeare, he's just an old patriarch? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=532.88s)]
*  You see, but that's a very dangerous game to play. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=535.36s)]
*  Now we've lost a common mooring [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=538.0s)]
*  and then we devolve into this sort of self-regarding autonomy. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=540.56s)]
*  So, I mean, Christianity is probably not the, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=545.76s)]
*  I don't think it's the only religion to make this point, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=548.3599999999999s)]
*  but self is the trap. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=550.2399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=552.1199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so you think of the self here, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=553.5999999999999s)]
*  the ego is like a black hole, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=555.68s)]
*  a black hole that will draw everything into itself. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  Sucks all of life and light and energy into itself. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  Nothing can escape. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=563.9599999999999s)]
*  The crevatus in se, ego, right, becomes a black hole. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=565.52s)]
*  And I've known people like that, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=569.52s)]
*  I'm sure you have too, if you're with them, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=571.12s)]
*  they'll draw everything into themselves. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=573.52s)]
*  The best people are those who breathe life into a room. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=576.48s)]
*  And that happens because they're not preoccupied [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  with the ego, they're captivated by some objective good [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=582.4s)]
*  and they wanna show it to you. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=586.28s)]
*  Think of some great coaches I had as a kid [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=588.4s)]
*  that wanted to show me the various games [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=590.52s)]
*  I learned to play, baseball. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  We had a coach when I was a little guy, [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  seven, eight years old, and he said, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=596.44s)]
*  all right guys, I want you to get down on your hands [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=597.56s)]
*  and knees on the field, I want you to feel the infield. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=599.28s)]
*  And I want you to smell the grass. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=602.72s)]
*  And it was such a good move, he was trying to get us, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=606.56s)]
*  look at this great game we're playing here. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=609.4s)]
*  He also practically, if you're playing shortstop, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=611.04s)]
*  you can't be afraid of the ground, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=613.48s)]
*  you gotta get down to the ground. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=614.52s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=615.56s)]
*  So all right, boys, get down there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=616.4s)]
*  Well, he was someone in love with baseball [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=618.84s)]
*  and then was communicating to us the same love. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=620.76s)]
*  So together we'd fall in love with the transcendent third, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=623.92s)]
*  which is baseball. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=626.8s)]
*  That's gonna bring a team together, right? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=628.0s)]
*  That's what great teachers and coaches and mentors [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=630.92s)]
*  and spiritual directors do. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=633.56s)]
*  They help people fall in love with the same values [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=635.52s)]
*  they fall in love with. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=637.96s)]
*  And fall in love with something bigger than themselves, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=640.52s)]
*  other people, nature, God. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=643.28s)]
*  And look, even that fall in love, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=644.76s)]
*  you're not in control, you've let go of your own ego drama. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=647.12s)]
*  I love that language from Hans Urs von Balthasar, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=652.28s)]
*  one of my favorite theologians from the last century. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=655.12s)]
*  John Paul loved him and Benedict loved him. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=657.44s)]
*  He talked about the ego drama, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=660.32s)]
*  which is the drama that I'm starring in, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=661.96s)]
*  I'm producing it, I'm directing it, right? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=664.88s)]
*  And you're all actors in my play. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=668.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes, you're all actors in my play [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=670.32s)]
*  and I'm gonna take it on the road [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=671.84s)]
*  eventually somewhere else. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=672.96s)]
*  Well, that's a very boring thing. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=674.24s)]
*  What's exciting, he said, was the theodrama, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=677.0s)]
*  which is now God's writing a drama, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=679.12s)]
*  God's producing a drama. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=681.1600000000001s)]
*  He's got a role for you [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=682.24s)]
*  and he's trying to draw you into playing that role. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=683.88s)]
*  And it might not be the role at all [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=687.0s)]
*  that you envisioned for yourself. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=688.28s)]
*  Yes, so what? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=689.4s)]
*  But he's calling you into it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=690.24s)]
*  That's gonna be an exciting life, a theodramatic life, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=691.88s)]
*  a theonomist life, not an autonomous life. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=695.08s)]
*  Oh, that's, wow, that's vivid. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  So what's the daily practice for someone [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=701.24s)]
*  to move beyond himself to get out of Lake Me? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=704.48s)]
*  Fall in love with objective value, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=708.0s)]
*  find mentors that can really help you enter that world. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=709.92s)]
*  In my own life, I've loved that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=713.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm no great, I play the guitar poorly, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=715.24s)]
*  but I love classical music. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=718.2800000000001s)]
*  I had mentors early on that, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  let me play you Beethoven's 7th Symphony, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=721.6800000000001s)]
*  let me just play it to you and then talk about it. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=724.44s)]
*  I remember the Queen of the Night aria, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=727.6s)]
*  the famous Mozart aria, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=730.36s)]
*  where the woman is singing using possibly high notes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=731.4000000000001s)]
*  I remember teachers, listen to this, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=734.6s)]
*  someone that would draw me into that world, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=737.72s)]
*  like my coach is drawing me into baseball. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  Now, put it in religious context, prayer. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=742.36s)]
*  People that taught me how to pray when I was a young guy, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=745.28s)]
*  and we'd say, okay, say my prayers. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=747.64s)]
*  No, but prayer is a conscious exercise [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=749.5600000000001s)]
*  in overcoming autonomy, right? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=753.2s)]
*  It's a conscious exercise to say, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=755.72s)]
*  I wanna get out of my preoccupations. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=757.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm placing myself in the presence of God. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=760.4s)]
*  I'm using language of the Psalms and so on, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=763.72s)]
*  I'm using song, I'm using silence, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=766.08s)]
*  I'm using the rosary, whatever it is. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=767.88s)]
*  All of this designed to get me up out of myself [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=770.2s)]
*  and into the space of God. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=773.48s)]
*  So prayer is a way to overcome. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=775.44s)]
*  How do you pray? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=777.6400000000001s)]
*  You said you were taught to pray. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=779.36s)]
*  I was indeed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=780.6s)]
*  Very early on when I was about maybe my early 20s, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=782.72s)]
*  before I was a priest, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=784.8000000000001s)]
*  but I got into what we call the Liturgy of the Hours [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  in the Catholic Church, which is this daily prayer, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=788.6800000000001s)]
*  at certain points during the day, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=791.44s)]
*  imitating, by the way, the seven times you pray in the Bible, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=792.9200000000001s)]
*  seven times a day you stop to pray. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=795.88s)]
*  So the hours, Psalms, Canticles, Biblical... [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=798.2s)]
*  The Bible tells... [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=801.12s)]
*  The Old Testament has that, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=803.36s)]
*  and the passage is about seven times I stopped to pray. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=804.44s)]
*  And so the early church imitated that [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=808.0s)]
*  in the rhythm of the monastic life. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=810.0s)]
*  And the Liturgy of the Hours would be kind of [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=812.5200000000001s)]
*  a monastic life for non-monks, people like you and me. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=814.2s)]
*  But you use the Psalms, the Canticles, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=818.6800000000001s)]
*  the readings, the Church Fathers. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=820.6400000000001s)]
*  And I was taught that prayer early on, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=822.6s)]
*  and at times I found it tiresome or difficult to do. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=824.5200000000001s)]
*  Now it's like water in the desert. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=827.92s)]
*  When I was a young guy, we didn't pray the rosary. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=831.8399999999999s)]
*  The rosary was seen as kind of something your grandmother did. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=834.16s)]
*  My generation didn't spontaneously pray it, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=836.88s)]
*  but then I learned it later in life. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  And that too is like a lifeline to me. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=841.0799999999999s)]
*  What is the rosary? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=843.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, it's this collection. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=844.92s)]
*  Do I have it on me? [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=846.36s)]
*  It's a collection of Hail Marys, Our Fathers, Glory Bees, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=847.36s)]
*  in a rope, and you count your way through the beads. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=850.76s)]
*  And it takes about 20 or 25 minutes. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=855.68s)]
*  It's a meditative prayer. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=858.5999999999999s)]
*  As you're praying the Hail Marys, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=859.8s)]
*  you're meditating upon the mysteries of Jesus' life [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=861.0s)]
*  and Mary's life. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=863.16s)]
*  It doesn't get you anywhere. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  You start here and you end up exactly where you started. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=866.2399999999999s)]
*  So it's not effective in that way. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=869.8399999999999s)]
*  It's a meditative prayer. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=873.16s)]
*  I prayed it, I remember I was giving a retreat [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=874.4s)]
*  to the priests of Dublin many years ago. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=876.4s)]
*  These were mostly older men, been through the wars, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=879.0799999999999s)]
*  most of them. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=881.92s)]
*  And they invited me to come, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=882.92s)]
*  and so we're gonna pray the rosary. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=884.88s)]
*  And all these Irish guys. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=886.32s)]
*  Hail Mary, for the grace of our city, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=888.88s)]
*  best of all, hail Mary, for the grace of our city, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=889.96s)]
*  best of all, hail Mary, for the grace of our city. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=892.0400000000001s)]
*  Now what is going on? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=892.88s)]
*  But what became clear to me was, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=894.96s)]
*  well, it's like a mantra. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=896.52s)]
*  They were producing this kind of meditative mantra. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=897.52s)]
*  They finished it in about seven minutes. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=901.6800000000001s)]
*  It takes usually 25. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  But that's part- [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=906.08s)]
*  They don't pronounce all the sounds though, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=907.2s)]
*  in that way. No, they're kind of, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=908.84s)]
*  see, think of it, the Buddhist talk about [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=910.96s)]
*  the calming of the monkey mind. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=913.56s)]
*  That's the mind that's always leaping from branch to branch. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=915.12s)]
*  The mind that gets you through the day. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=917.84s)]
*  I gotta do this, gotta do that. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=918.96s)]
*  But to really pray, you have to calm that mind down. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=920.4399999999999s)]
*  You have to, come on, come on. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=923.48s)]
*  I can't be practical with that. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=924.48s)]
*  So the church has often used these means to do that, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=926.52s)]
*  to calm that mind, to open up to a deeper consciousness [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=929.64s)]
*  or a deeper awareness. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=933.6s)]
*  And prayer is that, it seems to me. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=935.0799999999999s)]
*  Thomas Merton said, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=938.68s)]
*  prayer is finding the place in you [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=940.16s)]
*  where you are here and now being created by God. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=943.52s)]
*  Which I think is a great definition of prayer. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=946.12s)]
*  So right now, you and I are being created by God. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=948.24s)]
*  But we're rarely aware of that. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=952.28s)]
*  We go through our day, the monkey mind, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=953.5600000000001s)]
*  and we're doing this and this. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=955.68s)]
*  But at certain points you say, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=957.32s)]
*  okay, I'm gonna calm the monkey mind. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=958.68s)]
*  I'm gonna open up a deeper door, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=961.16s)]
*  and I'm gonna commune with the God [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=965.04s)]
*  who's here and now creating me. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=966.48s)]
*  That's prayer. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=968.8s)]
*  And then there's all kinds of disciplines around that. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=970.16s)]
*  So the people trying to wreck our civilization [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=972.16s)]
*  want you to be passive. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=974.56s)]
*  They want you weak so they can control you. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=976.68s)]
*  Weakness is their goal. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=980.04s)]
*  No thanks. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=982.76s)]
*  Our friends at Beam, a proud American company, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=983.88s)]
*  understand that our country can only be great [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=987.1999999999999s)]
*  if its people are strong. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=989.8s)]
*  And that's why they've created a new creatine product [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=992.04s)]
*  to help listeners like you stay mentally sharp [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=993.96s)]
*  and physically fit. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=996.6s)]
*  People like to mock creatine. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=998.56s)]
*  CNN doesn't like creatine at all. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=999.92s)]
*  People buy it because it works. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1001.68s)]
*  Beam's creatine can help you improve your strength, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1005.1999999999999s)]
*  your brain health, your longevity. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1007.52s)]
*  It's completely free of sugar and synthetic garbage [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1009.68s)]
*  that's in almost everything else that you eat. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1012.8399999999999s)]
*  Of course, you don't hear about it too much [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1015.56s)]
*  because again, a population that is strong, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1017.5999999999999s)]
*  clear-minded, and physically capable [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1020.52s)]
*  is a threat to tyrants. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1022.8399999999999s)]

*  I think many people think of prayer [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1054.48s)]
*  as a list of requests. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1055.56s)]
*  And that's okay. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1057.32s)]
*  I mean, petitionary prayer is good. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1058.24s)]
*  John Paul II, toward the end of his life, he said, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1060.96s)]
*  I know different types of prayer, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1063.4s)]
*  but I found the longer I lived [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1064.92s)]
*  that all prayer is basically a petition. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1066.96s)]
*  And there's something really right about that, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1070.32s)]
*  no matter how high and elevated your prayer is, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  at bottom, you're saying, Lord Jesus Christ, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1075.64s)]
*  have pity on me. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1079.1200000000001s)]
*  Or Lord, help me. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1080.44s)]
*  I find it, as I pray, that's the phrase, help me. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1082.68s)]
*  Help me Lord. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1087.2s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1088.48s)]
*  I have no problem with that. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1089.32s)]
*  That's a very deep and powerful prayer. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1090.16s)]
*  How do you keep your mind from wandering during prayer? [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1091.72s)]
*  Yeah, and read the masters. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1094.08s)]
*  They've recognized that forever. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1095.8s)]
*  The desert fathers knew all about that distraction [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  and prayer. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1099.8s)]
*  And of course the devil loves that too. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1100.64s)]
*  He loves to distract us in prayer. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1101.96s)]
*  The best advice, someone like John of the Cross, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1105.6000000000001s)]
*  our greatest spiritual master, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1107.28s)]
*  it would be acknowledge the distraction. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1108.56s)]
*  Don't try to fight it, acknowledge it, and then go back. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1111.2s)]
*  And when it comes again, acknowledge it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1114.8s)]
*  I see you. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1116.24s)]
*  And go back. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1118.0s)]
*  Don't try to fight it or don't try techniques [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1119.84s)]
*  to avoid it completely. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1121.8s)]
*  The distraction comes, see it, and then return. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1123.4s)]
*  Let go of it. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1126.28s)]
*  I've noticed in the past few years, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1128.44s)]
*  people I know who are secular or have always been [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1130.84s)]
*  suddenly talking about the existence of evil in the world. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1134.1200000000001s)]
*  I think it's very clear to non-religious people, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1137.0s)]
*  even, that there's some kind of supernatural force [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1140.8s)]
*  of darkness like a foot in the world. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1143.28s)]
*  I don't think you really need to make that case anymore [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1146.28s)]
*  if that's real. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1147.92s)]
*  How do you see God in the world? [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1148.92s)]
*  Because if you spend your life staring at evil, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1151.96s)]
*  probably not productive. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1155.76s)]
*  No, well the world is charged with the grandeur of God. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1156.96s)]
*  That's Jared Manley Hopkins' great poem. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1159.48s)]
*  And I think that's right, is if you have the eyes to see [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1161.24s)]
*  and prayer disciplines that, prayer makes that possible. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1163.68s)]
*  The world is charged with the grandeur of God, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1167.44s)]
*  meaning everything that exists, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1169.1200000000001s)]
*  because being in good are convertible terms. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1170.76s)]
*  That's something from Thomas Aquinas [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1172.96s)]
*  that I think you can. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1174.72s)]
*  Being in good are convertible terms. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1175.72s)]
*  Are convertible terms. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1177.52s)]
*  In other words, to be is to be good, period. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1178.44s)]
*  Whatever is, is good. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  Evil is, Aquinas would call it a privatio, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1183.76s)]
*  a privation of the good. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1187.1599999999999s)]
*  Evil is a cavity, it's a lack, right? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1188.76s)]
*  But whatever is, is good. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  So for example, take the devil as an example. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1194.36s)]
*  Is the devil good? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1196.1599999999999s)]
*  Sure, of course. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1197.24s)]
*  In the measure the devil exists, has a mind, has a will, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1198.32s)]
*  all that is good. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1201.56s)]
*  What's evil about the devil is the corruption [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1203.0s)]
*  of mind and will and power, right? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1206.1599999999999s)]
*  That's why like Satan and Dante, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1208.6399999999999s)]
*  this is highest of angels, full of goodness. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1210.9599999999998s)]
*  God doesn't make anything that's not good. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1214.9599999999998s)]
*  But it's become corrupt, see? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1217.4799999999998s)]
*  So the trick there is always to focus on the good, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1219.52s)]
*  because being in good are convertible terms. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1222.9599999999998s)]
*  Whatever is, is good. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1224.9199999999998s)]
*  Think of the mystics who talk about, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1226.36s)]
*  you see like a little bug crawling across this table. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  That's an avenue toward God. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1231.0s)]
*  Because if you look at this little tiny bug, let's say, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1233.56s)]
*  but the more you look at it, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1236.2s)]
*  I mean, incredible complexity and richness [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1237.24s)]
*  and density of its being. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1239.52s)]
*  And of course it speaks to you of the creator of all things, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1240.8799999999999s)]
*  that whose very nature is to be, right? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1245.84s)]
*  So all being reflects God. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1248.04s)]
*  And if you have the eyes to see, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1250.0s)]
*  that's what the great saints have. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1251.32s)]
*  They just, they see that all the time. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1252.52s)]
*  We sinners tend to focus a lot on the lack, right? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1254.9199999999998s)]
*  We focus on the cavity, not the tooth. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1258.12s)]
*  The idea is look at the tooth. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1260.48s)]
*  Always acknowledging the cavities, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1262.96s)]
*  because there are plenty of them. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1264.84s)]
*  But the focus should be on being, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1266.28s)]
*  being good or convertible terms. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1268.52s)]
*  I may be too shallow for Catholic theology, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1271.16s)]
*  but I love what you're saying. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1273.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's as old as- [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1274.72s)]
*  Being and good are convertible terms. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1275.8s)]
*  We know, they talk about the transcendental properties [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1277.84s)]
*  of being, which means wherever there is, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1280.08s)]
*  so there's glass. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1281.6s)]
*  It's good, it's true, and it's beautiful. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1282.8s)]
*  Now, why is it good? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1285.8s)]
*  Well, because it corresponds to the will in some ways. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1286.64s)]
*  There's, you know, yeah, this glass, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1288.64s)]
*  I want to study this glass. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1290.52s)]
*  Interesting, and look at the beauty of it, you know? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1291.72s)]
*  It's true, because it corresponds in its intelligibility [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1295.04s)]
*  to an inquiring mind. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1297.6799999999998s)]
*  The mind wants to understand that thing. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1299.32s)]
*  What is that thing? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1301.0s)]
*  It's beautiful because it's radiant, you know? [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1302.36s)]
*  It, go back to like James Joyce, the famous scene, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1305.48s)]
*  you know, in the portrait of the artist, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1308.96s)]
*  when he sees the woman, he eventually would marry, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  know her barnacle, and he sees her out on the strand, [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1312.8799999999999s)]
*  and he has this rapturous description of her, remember? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1315.36s)]
*  And at the end of it, he says, oh, heavenly God. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1318.6s)]
*  And that's the way it works, is the beautiful, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1322.28s)]
*  this particular girl he sees out in the surf, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1324.72s)]
*  but she speaks to him of God. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1328.36s)]
*  So that's why whatever is, is good, it's true, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1331.2s)]
*  and it's beautiful. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1333.48s)]
*  Those are all convertible terms. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1334.8s)]
*  It seems like the threat, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1337.2s)]
*  maybe the satanic threat is distraction. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1339.2s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I think that's absolutely right, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1341.48s)]
*  that we focus so much on the lack. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1343.84s)]
*  It's like you're sucking on an aching tooth, you know? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1345.6399999999999s)]
*  You're focused on the lack. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1347.88s)]
*  But see, you know, as Paul says, where sin abounds, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1350.68s)]
*  grace abounds the more, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1353.68s)]
*  and that's not just a nice, like, Hallmark heart sentiment, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1355.2800000000002s)]
*  that's a metaphysical truth. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1357.92s)]
*  Wherever there's sin, sure, sin everywhere, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1360.16s)]
*  but grace is always greater, it has to be, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1362.68s)]
*  because sin is a cavity. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1365.5600000000002s)]
*  You know, it's in Tolkien, remember when the, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1367.16s)]
*  what are they, the Nazguls, or these flying demons, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1369.3200000000002s)]
*  they're threatening the battlefield and all this, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1372.64s)]
*  but then when they finally conquer them, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1374.96s)]
*  they discover they're nothing. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1376.68s)]
*  They're a cloak that covers nothing, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1378.6s)]
*  and it's because evil is a type of non-being, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1381.16s)]
*  and so it puts on a big show, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1384.72s)]
*  it puts this big cloak over itself, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1387.44s)]
*  but what it is is just a lack, it's a cavity. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1389.56s)]
*  That's why if sin is abounding, sure, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1392.72s)]
*  sin abounds in our world, but grace abounds the more. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1394.96s)]
*  You know, that's the gates of hell [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1398.96s)]
*  will not prevail against us, they can't in a way, they can't, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1400.12s)]
*  and we should have that confidence. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1404.08s)]
*  Christians should never be cowed by evil, like, oh my, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1406.0s)]
*  we acknowledge it, but the great saints are cowed by evil, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1409.76s)]
*  because evil is a lack, it's a cavity, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1413.8s)]
*  it's a Nazgul, it's a non-being, right? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1416.88s)]
*  Where do you see grace? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1421.2s)]
*  Bob Dylan is one of my great heroes, you know, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1424.8400000000001s)]
*  look around this whole world and all that I'm finding [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1427.08s)]
*  is the saving grace that's over me, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1429.48s)]
*  that's Bob Dylan, after he became a Christian. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1431.44s)]
*  You know, grace is being, grace is what's real, grace. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1434.84s)]
*  Tout est grâce, that's a line from Bernard Nost, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1438.9199999999998s)]
*  the great French Catholic novelist, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1441.32s)]
*  Tout est grâce, everything's grace, everything's grace. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1443.04s)]
*  Because of that principle, whatever is is good, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1446.04s)]
*  whatever is is true and beautiful, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1449.56s)]
*  whatever is reflects the one whose name is to be, right? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1451.28s)]
*  When Moses asked God, what's your name? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1455.36s)]
*  And God says, I am who I am, right? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1457.48s)]
*  Well, our tradition reads that as, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1459.6799999999998s)]
*  I'm not contingent, evenessent being, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1461.76s)]
*  I'm the one whose very nature is to be. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1464.1599999999999s)]
*  So therefore, whatever is, is reflective of God. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1466.28s)]
*  That's where you find grace, I think. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1470.08s)]
*  So if you could distract people, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  sufficient that they never had the time [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1474.28s)]
*  or the inclination to notice things that are real, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1478.1999999999998s)]
*  you would trap them in a kind of hell. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1482.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yes, but that's exactly what happens, isn't it? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1484.1599999999999s)]
*  Dude, now psychodynamically, is when we focus [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1487.4399999999998s)]
*  on all this kind of lack and anxiety [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1490.56s)]
*  and frustration within us, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1492.36s)]
*  it is a kind of preoccupation with what's not real. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1493.3999999999999s)]
*  That's true. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1496.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm not denying the psychological reality of suffering, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1497.24s)]
*  but metaphysically speaking, evil is a type of nonbeing. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1501.6s)]
*  And if I'm focused on that, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1506.6s)]
*  then I'm gonna get myself in Nost. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1508.12s)]
*  I was thinking more of the iPhone, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1509.9199999999998s)]
*  which when I use it, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1511.8s)]
*  cuts me off completely from other people, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1513.56s)]
*  from the world around me, from nature, from myself. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1515.6s)]
*  Yes, no, no, and believe me, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1519.12s)]
*  I mean, we're all addicted to it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1521.1599999999999s)]
*  Those machines were designed to be addictive. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1522.2399999999998s)]
*  They worked. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1523.9599999999998s)]
*  During Lent, this past Lent, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1525.6s)]
*  I did a resolution for the first time [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1527.52s)]
*  that one day a week I put the phone away. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1529.28s)]
*  And I did it, and it was a little bit of a struggle, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1531.36s)]
*  but not terrible. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1533.6s)]
*  And I thought, that's a good thing. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1534.4399999999998s)]
*  When we bring our guys now into priesthood studies, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1536.32s)]
*  we always call the propodutic year, [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1539.76s)]
*  this year of kind of preparation [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1541.4399999999998s)]
*  before the formal study begins. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1542.84s)]
*  And the thing that all the guys say they like best about it [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1545.1999999999998s)]
*  is they take their cell phones away. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1550.04s)]
*  So for the entire year, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  I think once a week you can check it [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1552.04s)]
*  for emergencies or something, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1553.3999999999999s)]
*  or someone's got access to it in case of emergency, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1554.56s)]
*  but they take the phones away from the guys. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1557.56s)]
*  Great move. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1559.72s)]
*  And what happens to them? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1560.6s)]
*  What happens, they all feel liberated. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1561.6s)]
*  They all come back saying it was the best year of my life. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1563.1999999999998s)]
*  And I read books again, and I talked to people. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1565.8799999999999s)]
*  I cultivated friendship. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1569.6s)]
*  I played games. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1571.12s)]
*  I played sports. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1572.12s)]
*  And it's exactly this principle. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1573.84s)]
*  I wasn't, look at, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1575.48s)]
*  that's almost an illustration of Augustin's [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1577.1999999999998s)]
*  crevatus and say that I'm caved in over my iPhone, right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1579.9199999999998s)]
*  That's what it looks like. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you think that that's driving some of the disassociation [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1587.2399999999998s)]
*  and agony that we see around us? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1590.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's not helping at all. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1592.8799999999999s)]
*  Jean Twenge is a psychologist from San Diego [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1595.36s)]
*  that I read a lot. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1597.8799999999999s)]
*  And she has a book called, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1598.7199999999998s)]
*  I, Gen about the generation that came of age totally [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1599.7199999999998s)]
*  with the iPhones and iPads and stuff. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1602.4799999999998s)]
*  And she said there's a direct correlation [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1605.32s)]
*  between screen time and depression, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1607.2s)]
*  which I find perfectly plausible. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1609.24s)]
*  Leonard Sachs, the great psychologist, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1611.56s)]
*  also a physician dealing with young people now for decades. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1613.52s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1617.28s)]
*  He says the correlation between screen time [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1618.12s)]
*  and look how unhealthy it's making our young kids. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1621.0s)]
*  When I was a little kid, we were all skinny. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1624.3999999999999s)]
*  We all were, all my friends and I, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1626.6399999999999s)]
*  cause we were outside from eight o'clock in the morning [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1629.08s)]
*  until eight o'clock at night in the summertime, [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1631.3999999999999s)]
*  playing games, running around, shooting hoops on a bike. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1633.32s)]
*  And way too many kids now are hunched over their iPhones. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1637.28s)]
*  And then it invites you into such a world of meanness [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1640.28s)]
*  and competition and look at my pictures better than yours. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1646.96s)]
*  And those people have seemed so much happier than I am. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1651.0s)]
*  And no, I think taking those things out of the hands [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1653.1599999999999s)]
*  of our kids would be a great idea, at least to some degree. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1655.8799999999999s)]
*  How do you force yourself to notice things beyond yourself? [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1659.36s)]
*  Like what is your actual discipline? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1662.6s)]
*  Like you wake up, how do you keep God ever present in mind [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1664.24s)]
*  and yourself at bay? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1667.76s)]
*  Well, my first move is the holy hour. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1669.12s)]
*  So I learned that from Fulton Sheen, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1671.24s)]
*  taught now a couple of generations to do every day [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1673.3999999999999s)]
*  an hour of uninterrupted prayer [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1677.52s)]
*  in the presence of the blessed sacrament. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1680.1599999999999s)]
*  So as a Catholic, I have the blessed sacrament in my house. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1681.6799999999998s)]
*  So first thing I do in the morning, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1684.6s)]
*  I get a cup of coffee and I go up to my chapel [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1685.7199999999998s)]
*  and I will sit in front of the blessed sacrament for an hour. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1689.04s)]
*  And I'll pray my office as part of it, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1692.2s)]
*  often pray the rosary or other things. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1694.2s)]
*  Pardon to get my ignorance, what's your office? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1696.32s)]
*  You pray your office? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1699.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's the Liturgy of the Hours. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1700.24s)]
*  Yeah, what I was describing earlier. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1701.32s)]
*  So that Psalms and canticles and readings that a priest- [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1702.76s)]
*  You read them as you pray them? [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1706.72s)]
*  Yeah, so I have the book and I'll read the Psalm. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1708.28s)]
*  Then usually then spend some time meditating [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1710.6000000000001s)]
*  and then do the next one. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1713.64s)]
*  And then I might, let's say between the Office of Readings, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1715.0800000000002s)]
*  which has to do with the church fathers. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1718.24s)]
*  I read something from the church fathers [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1720.28s)]
*  and usually from the Bible. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1722.32s)]
*  Maybe between that and morning prayer, I'll do the rosary. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1723.64s)]
*  And I might do another form of prayer [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1728.16s)]
*  between morning prayer and midday prayer. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1729.8s)]
*  So I'll work my way through the office, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1732.16s)]
*  the Liturgy of the Hours, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  but my main task is to sit [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1735.72s)]
*  in the presence of the blessed sacrament. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1739.36s)]
*  And one of the great lines, this goes back to- [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1741.12s)]
*  And what time is this in the morning? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1742.8s)]
*  I wake up about 5.30, so like between 5.30 and 6.30. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1744.44s)]
*  Do you text like 11 people first before you do this? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1747.56s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1749.8s)]
*  And I leave the phone in my bedroom. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1750.6399999999999s)]
*  So I always leave the phone while I'm praying. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1752.52s)]
*  I don't have that. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1754.44s)]
*  Because that's an immediate distraction. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1755.44s)]
*  And that's the last thing you want [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1757.08s)]
*  when you're trying to pray in a concentrated way. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1758.76s)]
*  And then some of that too is petitionary prayer. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1761.04s)]
*  I'm a bishop, so people are always, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1764.32s)]
*  hey, bishop, would you pray for me? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1766.12s)]
*  I have my sons having a hard time. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1767.56s)]
*  So I try to conjure as best I can [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1769.52s)]
*  the memory of these various people [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  that ask me to pray for them. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1774.0s)]
*  I'll pray for my parents and family members who've died. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1775.48s)]
*  So it's just giving yourself the leisure. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1779.76s)]
*  You have a full hour where you can bring [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1782.64s)]
*  all this before the Lord. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1784.68s)]
*  But when you pray for someone who's died, what do you pray? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1786.48s)]
*  I pray they might find peace and rest. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1790.0s)]
*  I pray the Lord might be kind and good to them. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1793.2s)]
*  I pray all the time for people who've died, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1797.4s)]
*  because you're aware of it when you're in pastoral ministry. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1798.8400000000001s)]
*  Some people who've died, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1804.2s)]
*  they're not formally canonized by the church, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1805.4s)]
*  but I kind of in an informal way, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1807.0s)]
*  I think of them as being already in the presence of God [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1808.32s)]
*  and I'll pray for their intercession. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1810.8799999999999s)]
*  Cardinal George of Chicago was a great mentor to me. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1813.84s)]
*  And I'm often linked to him in prayer. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1816.24s)]
*  Meaning you pray for him? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1820.48s)]
*  Pray for him, but also I prayed to him, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1822.08s)]
*  not with the complete confidence [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1825.6399999999999s)]
*  I would pray to a saint canonized by the church, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1827.0s)]
*  but with a kind of practical confidence. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1829.04s)]
*  And I knew him very well. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1831.76s)]
*  And I asked for his help. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1833.04s)]
*  When you pray, do you hear back? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1836.04s)]
*  Not in the physical sense, but yeah, you get, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1837.96s)]
*  I'd say a sense, you have a sense of connection. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1842.76s)]
*  I put it that way. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1846.52s)]
*  Sometimes in prayer, you get a very intense feeling. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1848.2s)]
*  The Irish talk about thin places, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1851.32s)]
*  where the veil between this world and next [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1854.08s)]
*  becomes very thin. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1856.2s)]
*  I find there are kind of thin moments like that, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1857.76s)]
*  where there's a moment when you feel the other world [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1859.96s)]
*  impinging on yours. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1863.72s)]
*  What kind of feeling is that? [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1865.8400000000001s)]
*  Peace, I would say. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1868.2s)]
*  Harmony, the disharmony, the difficulty of this life [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1871.6000000000001s)]
*  kind of resolved into a higher harmony, something like that. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1875.2s)]
*  See, you know what's interesting to me, Tucker, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1880.48s)]
*  is the world that we're in, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1882.16s)]
*  looking around at this interesting, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1884.72s)]
*  beautiful place right now. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1886.5200000000002s)]
*  Good, and the world of nature, driving up here, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1889.16s)]
*  seeing the nature around me. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1891.44s)]
*  Beautiful, beautiful. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1893.6s)]
*  But like, is that it? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1895.0s)]
*  Is that it? [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1897.4399999999998s)]
*  To me, it seems so unlikely that the world, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1899.1599999999999s)]
*  that the sensorium of these advanced apes can take in [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1902.3999999999999s)]
*  is all there is to reality. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1906.56s)]
*  What my little eyes can see, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1908.52s)]
*  they see a narrow range of the color spectrum, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1910.6799999999998s)]
*  and that's it. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1913.48s)]
*  I think that's so wildly unlikely. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1915.36s)]
*  Just the fecundity and variety of being [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1918.6399999999999s)]
*  that we experience through our senses. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1923.6399999999999s)]
*  I think beyond our senses, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1926.1599999999999s)]
*  there's a world of even more extraordinary fecundity [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1928.04s)]
*  and richness, and I think there are times when we sense it, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1931.3999999999999s)]
*  we get in touch with it. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1935.84s)]
*  Look, Plato knew that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1938.7199999999998s)]
*  Plato knew, he talked about stepping out of the cave, right? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1940.28s)]
*  And the first step out of the cave, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1943.8799999999999s)]
*  the cave is where the flickering shadows on the wall, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1945.4399999999998s)]
*  it means the world of our ordinary experience. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1947.56s)]
*  I'm here with you right now in a few hours, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1949.4799999999998s)]
*  I'll be gone somewhere else, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1951.28s)]
*  and other images will be flickering past my sensorium. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1952.36s)]
*  Okay, that's what this life is like. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1955.56s)]
*  But Plato thought the first step out of the cave [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1958.32s)]
*  was mathematics. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1960.32s)]
*  It's very interesting, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1961.52s)]
*  because when you understand two plus three equals five, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1962.76s)]
*  you've stepped out of this world in a very real way. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1967.08s)]
*  I can see, oh, here are two things, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  but when you grasp the principle, two plus three equals five, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1972.88s)]
*  you're not in the world of ordinary experience anymore. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1977.4s)]
*  You're in a world now of eternity, of immateriality, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1979.96s)]
*  a world that doesn't change, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1984.3600000000001s)]
*  that can't change even in principle. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1985.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, there's nothing like that in this world. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1987.64s)]
*  Well, Plato knew that. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1989.56s)]
*  When you grasp the quadratic equation or something, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1991.32s)]
*  you're not dealing with a physical reality [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1994.68s)]
*  that has color or shape or size, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1997.24s)]
*  or nothing that's evenessent or mutable. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=1999.16s)]
*  You've reached a higher plane of existence. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2002.16s)]
*  Even mathematics does that to us. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2003.8s)]
*  A fortiori, now philosophy, and then even more so religion, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2006.96s)]
*  are opening you to higher and higher expressions of reality. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2012.08s)]
*  Here's the facts of life you may not learn until you're older, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2015.68s)]
*  but I'm gonna tell you now. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2018.0s)]
*  It's very hard to have a good time [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2019.24s)]
*  if you're wearing bad boots. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2021.08s)]
*  In fact, it may be impossible, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2022.8s)]
*  and that's why you need Tacovas. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2024.08s)]
*  As a matter of fact, you don't just need them, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2026.08s)]
*  you owe them to yourself. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2027.32s)]
*  Tacovas makes Western boots for everybody, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2029.0s)]
*  ranchers, real ranchers, lifelong cowboys, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2031.68s)]
*  first-time boot buyers, and anyone in between. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2034.52s)]
*  Every Tacovas boot is handcrafted, made by hand, [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2037.08s)]
*  with over 200 meticulous steps [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2040.08s)]
*  for a broken-in feel right out of the box. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2043.28s)]
*  You don't have to compromise between looks and quality. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2045.64s)]

*  I'm getting that sense. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2072.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, there are a couple ways to look at that. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2075.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's a big debate going on right now [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2076.8s)]
*  in the world of evolutionary biologists [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2079.7200000000003s)]
*  about Darwin and neo-Darwinism and questions raised about it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2082.52s)]
*  I mean, in a way, I'm happy to leave that debate to them, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2086.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, because that's talking about [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2089.36s)]
*  how do life forms develop over time [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2091.0s)]
*  and given genetic variation and natural selection. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2094.32s)]
*  Okay, fine, I'll let the experts debate that. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2099.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2102.2s)]
*  That in itself is not really [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2103.24s)]
*  a theologically relevant concern. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2104.84s)]
*  I'll leave that to them. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2107.08s)]
*  I agree. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2108.12s)]
*  But see, here's the thing. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2108.96s)]
*  Creation in the theological sense [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2109.92s)]
*  has little to do with that. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2112.52s)]
*  That's all about development of biological forms. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2113.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2117.0s)]
*  Creation is much more dramatic. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2117.84s)]
*  Creation names the relationship that obtains [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2121.4s)]
*  between unconditioned being and conditioned being, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2125.44s)]
*  or to put that in more regular language, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2128.88s)]
*  between God and the world. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2131.16s)]
*  So I mean, like right now, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2133.04s)]
*  here you and I are sitting here in this table, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2134.12s)]
*  in this room, is entirely conditioned form of existence, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2135.96s)]
*  by which I mean it is, but it doesn't have to be. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2140.32s)]
*  I could have missed the ride up here today. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2144.52s)]
*  You could have gotten sick. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2146.4s)]
*  This thing could have fallen on the table. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2147.88s)]
*  It could be a thousand degrees and we'd be incinerated. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2151.5200000000004s)]
*  It could be a thousand degrees below zero. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2153.28s)]
*  We'd be frozen. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2154.6400000000003s)]
*  Like there are a million things [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2155.48s)]
*  that make this set of affairs real, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2157.0s)]
*  but it doesn't have to be. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2162.2400000000002s)]
*  It doesn't have to be the case. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2163.5600000000004s)]
*  So how do you explain that? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2166.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, you can't appeal endlessly to other contingent things. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2168.0s)]
*  You have to come finally to some reality [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2172.5600000000004s)]
*  whose very nature is to be. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2176.0800000000004s)]
*  That's not contingent, not finite, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2178.4s)]
*  not evenessent, not dependent, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2181.36s)]
*  but whose very nature is to be. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2182.92s)]
*  I am, like right, then go back to Moses. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2185.08s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2187.12s)]
*  See, Moses was asking a very sensible question [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2187.96s)]
*  for this worldly perspective. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2191.08s)]
*  So, hey, what kind of glass is that? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2192.64s)]
*  How tall is that glass? [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2195.36s)]
*  What kind of table is this? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2196.68s)]
*  Isn't that a nice table? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2197.52s)]
*  What kind of table is that? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2198.36s)]
*  So you're a God, obviously. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2200.08s)]
*  You seem to know a lot about me and you're, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2201.52s)]
*  so which one are you? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2203.72s)]
*  Are you the God of the mountain? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2204.56s)]
*  Are you the God of the place? [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2205.64s)]
*  Are you the God of these people? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2206.48s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2207.48s)]
*  Which one are you? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2208.32s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2209.14s)]
*  God says, I am who I am. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2209.98s)]
*  He's saying, dumb question. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2212.82s)]
*  That is not the right question to ask here [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2215.18s)]
*  because I'm not a conditioned state of affairs. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2217.46s)]
*  I'm not a being among many. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2219.86s)]
*  My name is I am. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2222.66s)]
*  I am who I am. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2225.5s)]
*  My nature is to be. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2227.62s)]
*  Now we're talking about the creator. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2229.46s)]
*  See, the creator is the one who is here and now [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2232.02s)]
*  undergirding all the finite reality. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2236.18s)]
*  Who's right now, this is a great line [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2239.2s)]
*  from Herbert McKay, the theologian. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2241.24s)]
*  He's singing the world into being [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2242.98s)]
*  the way an opera singer sustains a song. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2245.3399999999997s)]
*  God, the ground of being is singing [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2248.66s)]
*  this finite world into being. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2252.3999999999996s)]
*  That's creation, see? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2254.3399999999997s)]
*  So now within creation, I talk all day about the Darwinists [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2256.3799999999997s)]
*  and how this life form developed into that life form [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2260.46s)]
*  and I'll let them debate that. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2263.18s)]
*  But the religious question remains [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2264.8399999999997s)]
*  no matter what you say about that. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2266.4199999999996s)]
*  The religious question is about [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2268.2s)]
*  why is there something rather than nothing? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2269.62s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2271.56s)]
*  Why should there be a finite conditioned world at all? [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2272.3999999999996s)]
*  You can't explain it by appealing endlessly [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2276.3999999999996s)]
*  to other forms of conditioned existence. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2278.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2280.56s)]
*  That's the mistake of materialism, let's say. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2281.6s)]
*  So the questions end at a certain point [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2283.3999999999996s)]
*  and there's an answer. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2284.8399999999997s)]
*  So the question is, well, who created the creator? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2285.8399999999997s)]
*  And the answer is nobody, the creator is. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2289.4399999999996s)]
*  Right, and if you ask that question, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2291.64s)]
*  it means you haven't grasped the solution. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2293.04s)]
*  If you say who created the creator, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2295.04s)]
*  well, then you haven't grasped. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2296.2799999999997s)]
*  No, the argument leads towards something [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2297.32s)]
*  that doesn't need to be created, that can't be created, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2300.28s)]
*  whose very nature is to be. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2303.6800000000003s)]
*  And who therefore is eternal, we say, outside of time, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2305.52s)]
*  immaterial outside of space, right? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2308.4s)]
*  So all the finite things that are the characteristics [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2310.96s)]
*  of finite reality can't apply to that reality. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2313.8s)]
*  That's why we say God's eternal [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2318.36s)]
*  or why he's immaterial and so on, immutable. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2319.76s)]
*  That means nothing that characterizes finite things [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2322.96s)]
*  should characterize him. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2325.32s)]
*  What do you think of the new atheists? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2328.32s)]
*  I don't like them. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2330.1600000000003s)]
*  No, look, my ministry, a word on fire, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2333.1600000000003s)]
*  emerged around that time. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2336.2000000000003s)]
*  So right around the year 2000, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2337.48s)]
*  the new atheists emerged after September 11th, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2339.28s)]
*  which is not surprising because September 11th [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2341.84s)]
*  stirred to life again this old kind of enlightenment idea. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2346.0800000000004s)]
*  Religion is irrational, therefore it's violent. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2351.36s)]
*  Because they can't settle things through argument, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2355.28s)]
*  they have to settle them through bombs and guns and so on. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2357.36s)]
*  So that's an old argument, goes back to the 17th century. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2360.5600000000004s)]
*  It was revived massively after September 11th. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2363.96s)]
*  The new atheists, I think, rode that wave in a big way. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2367.32s)]
*  Now, they were gifted rhetoricians, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2370.44s)]
*  especially Hitchens, right? [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2372.6000000000004s)]
*  I admired Hitchens, I read Hitchens always [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2374.28s)]
*  with great pleasure, Dawkins less so, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2376.1600000000003s)]
*  Sam Harris, I think, has rhetorical gifts. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  But their arguments, there's nothing new about them. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2382.7599999999998s)]
*  They were old hat, they're borrowed from Marx [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2386.04s)]
*  and from Freud and from Feuerbach especially. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2388.3599999999997s)]
*  So nothing new at the intellectual level. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2392.24s)]
*  They were new in their nastiness. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2394.48s)]
*  So the classical atheists, think Feuerbach, Marx, Freud, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2396.56s)]
*  you got the sense they knew they were dealing [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2401.0s)]
*  with a formidable opponent when they were fighting religion. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2403.0s)]
*  The new atheists, it was like they were dealing [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2405.8399999999997s)]
*  with an idiot child, you know? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  And so that's what was so annoying about them, I thought. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2409.3199999999997s)]
*  And their arguments were pretty bad. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2412.3599999999997s)]
*  And they were so aggressive toward religion. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2414.3599999999997s)]
*  They did a great service though, I'll say this. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2418.8399999999997s)]
*  They awakened the Christian churches in many ways. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2421.12s)]
*  The apologetic weapons that we threw away 40 years ago, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2423.8799999999997s)]
*  we were compelled to pick up again. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2429.2s)]
*  So a lot of us got into the game [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2431.3999999999996s)]
*  to kind of battle the new atheists [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2433.24s)]
*  and to draw upon the very rich intellectual tradition, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2435.24s)]
*  especially of Catholicism. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2438.7999999999997s)]
*  So in that way, they did a service to us. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2440.52s)]
*  Also, I wrote a paper on this one. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2444.4s)]
*  I called it Thomas Aquinas and Why the New Atheists Are Right. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2446.0s)]
*  Because the new atheists, see, they make this mistake [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2450.12s)]
*  we were just talking about. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2452.4s)]
*  They will construe God as some kind of big being. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2453.48s)]
*  And okay, is there this big being or not? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2457.68s)]
*  Some say there is, some say there isn't. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2460.72s)]
*  So it's like Bigfoot, you know, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2462.88s)]
*  something there isn't Bigfoot, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2464.2s)]
*  other thing there isn't a Bigfoot. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2465.2s)]
*  Let's go look around for evidence and find out. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2466.48s)]
*  You'll never find God that way. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2469.4s)]
*  God isn't a being. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2471.72s)]
*  God isn't a thing in the world, right? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2472.72s)]
*  He's the reason why there's a world at all. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2475.68s)]
*  Therefore, you're not gonna find him in the world. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2478.16s)]
*  Therefore, you can't say things like, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2480.48s)]
*  oh, there's no evidence for God, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2481.7599999999998s)]
*  as though he's like a chemical reaction. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2483.88s)]
*  He's a yeti, yeah. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2487.24s)]
*  Right, he's not like that. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2488.2s)]
*  You have to ask a whole different set of questions. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2490.32s)]
*  And that's what the new atheists did. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2493.24s)]
*  Like what? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2495.48s)]
*  What were the questions? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2496.72s)]
*  Like why is there something wrong? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2497.7599999999998s)]
*  Like why should contingent being exist at all? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2499.8s)]
*  How do you explain the to be of something [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2502.76s)]
*  whose nature is not to be, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2505.4s)]
*  namely you and me and everything around us? [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2507.4s)]
*  I am for sure, but my nature is not to be. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2509.48s)]
*  I could think myself out of being in a second. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2512.84s)]
*  There's nothing necessary about me. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2515.04s)]
*  Well, how do you explain that? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2517.4s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2518.6800000000003s)]
*  Now you say, oh, it's all matter and energy. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2519.6s)]
*  It'll never work. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2522.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2523.52s)]
*  Because matter is always matter under these conditions, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2524.36s)]
*  matter in this size, matter of this energy, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2527.52s)]
*  matter at this speed, matter of this color. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2529.64s)]
*  How did it get there? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2532.2s)]
*  Why is it this rather than that? [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2533.04s)]
*  See, you can't answer that question, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2534.7599999999998s)]
*  the really cool, interesting question, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2537.32s)]
*  by appealing to something within the contingent world. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2539.24s)]
*  You have to go outside the contingent world. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2542.04s)]
*  And again, don't think of that spatially. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2545.7599999999998s)]
*  The minute you go, oh yeah, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2547.8s)]
*  God must be that up out there someplace. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2548.64s)]
*  No, he made him a big being. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2550.64s)]
*  You have to go outside in the metaphysical sense [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2552.24s)]
*  to a reality which indeed contains all of that, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2555.8s)]
*  but is in no way contained by it. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2559.88s)]
*  Now we're talking. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2562.1200000000003s)]
*  And that to me is the really interesting question. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2563.6400000000003s)]
*  We'd also suggest that God's like right here, right now. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2567.52s)]
*  Well, he is. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2571.0800000000004s)]
*  And here's the interesting thing [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2572.84s)]
*  and all the mystics and theologians around us. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2573.92s)]
*  So is God in this room? [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2576.0s)]
*  No, absolutely not. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2579.4s)]
*  Because this room was just full of contingent things [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2581.1600000000003s)]
*  like you and me in the shelves and the books. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2583.0800000000004s)]
*  No, God's nothing in this. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2585.24s)]
*  I can't point, oh there he is. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2587.16s)]
*  God's in this room. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2589.08s)]
*  God's nowhere in this room. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2590.04s)]
*  Is God in this room? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2592.4799999999996s)]
*  Yes, he's everywhere in this room [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2594.04s)]
*  because this room wouldn't exist [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2596.2799999999997s)]
*  unless God were singing it into being. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2598.2799999999997s)]
*  And so God is at the same time [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2600.9199999999996s)]
*  as transcendent as you can imagine, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2604.04s)]
*  not a thing in the world, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2606.2799999999997s)]
*  and as imminent as you can imagine. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2607.9199999999996s)]
*  It was the great Augustine who said, [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  God is at the same time superior sumo male [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2612.44s)]
*  at interior intimo male, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2616.28s)]
*  which means he's higher than anything I can imagine [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2619.32s)]
*  and he's closer to me than I am to myself. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2622.92s)]
*  Now figure that one out. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2626.44s)]
*  Now you understand the God whose nature is to be. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2627.92s)]
*  He's transcendent, I can't grasp him. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2630.6800000000003s)]
*  And he's so imminent, I can't hide from him. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2634.04s)]
*  And that's the space opened up by the Bible, I think. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2637.28s)]
*  So what's the solution you might ask? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2641.08s)]
*  The solution is fall in love with God. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2642.84s)]
*  Falling in love is not grasping, it's not hiding from. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2645.72s)]
*  And can we read the Bible as God trying [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2648.88s)]
*  to draw his people into that space? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2651.6s)]
*  I want you to fall in love with me. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2654.0s)]
*  I don't want you grasping at me, that's idolatry. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't want you hiding from me. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2658.24s)]
*  That's secularism, right? [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2659.7599999999998s)]
*  I want you falling in love with me. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2662.24s)]
*  And that's the right reaction to the God who's- [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2664.12s)]
*  You're defining secularism as hiding from God? [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2665.92s)]
*  Yeah, as an ideology. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2668.72s)]
*  If you were to say all that there is is the secular world, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2670.16s)]
*  as a materialism or immanentism or scientism [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2673.04s)]
*  in the political sense, secularism, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2675.9199999999996s)]
*  meaning all that there is is the world [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2678.0s)]
*  that I can see and measure and so on. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2679.48s)]
*  That's hiding from God. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2681.7999999999997s)]
*  That's saying, I'm not worried about God. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2682.8399999999997s)]
*  God doesn't impinge upon me. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2684.52s)]
*  That's the buffered self. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2687.08s)]
*  Charles Taylor, the philosopher calls it that. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2688.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm buffered from any contact with the transcendent. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2691.16s)]
*  That's an attempt to hide from God. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2694.08s)]
*  Doesn't work. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2696.16s)]
*  And see, what I think Tucker, it's really interesting [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2697.08s)]
*  is the fact that religion is experiencing a revival. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2698.64s)]
*  Even as we speak- [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2701.84s)]
*  You feel that? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2702.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah, I can measure it. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2703.72s)]
*  I mean, it's been measured statistically. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2705.24s)]
*  Because you can't hide from God all day. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2708.92s)]
*  And you can't grasp at him. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2711.36s)]
*  That's idolatry. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2712.56s)]
*  Idolatry is an attempt to manipulate God. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2713.4s)]
*  And the Bible knows all about that from page one. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2714.7999999999997s)]
*  Page one, the Bible knows about manipulating God. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2718.4s)]
*  Tell me what you mean by that, manipulating God. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2722.68s)]
*  Let's say the original sin is to say, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2723.52s)]
*  I'm not gonna obey God's law. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2725.84s)]
*  I'm my own law. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2728.04s)]
*  I'm gonna grasp the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2728.88s)]
*  Is I'm gonna make my own freedom, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2730.68s)]
*  as we were saying a few minutes ago, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2733.56s)]
*  my own freedom becomes my God. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2734.8s)]
*  That's a type of idolatry. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2736.8s)]
*  Or I turn pleasure, money, sex, power into my supreme good. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2738.72s)]
*  That's idolatry. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2743.72s)]
*  To me, the great biblical story there is the [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2745.96s)]
*  Elijah and the priests of Baal. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2749.12s)]
*  Remember in the first book of Kings? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2750.64s)]
*  So Elijah is the one left. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2752.68s)]
*  Not only one priest of Yahweh, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2754.48s)]
*  but there's all these priests of Baal. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2756.16s)]
*  By the way, so it always goes, right? [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2758.08s)]
*  There's always a lot of avatars and the false gods. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2760.3999999999996s)]
*  They're all over the place. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2762.7599999999998s)]
*  They're thick on the ground. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2763.7999999999997s)]
*  They're all over. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2765.04s)]
*  And now let's you erect altars to your God, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2766.2799999999997s)]
*  I'll write one to mine and let's see who responds, right? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2768.2799999999997s)]
*  So the priests of Baal erect the altars [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2771.68s)]
*  and then they start begging and they end up [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2774.48s)]
*  controlling and pleading and they're frustrated [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2776.24s)]
*  that God's not answering. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2779.3599999999997s)]
*  Their gods aren't sending fire. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2780.3199999999997s)]
*  And Elijah mocks them, [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2782.24s)]
*  which I think is a great part of that story. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2783.3199999999997s)]
*  He publicly mocks them. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2785.04s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2786.8s)]
*  Maybe your gods are napping or maybe they're in the bathroom. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2787.6400000000003s)]
*  I don't know where they are, right? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2789.76s)]
*  And then they finally end up, it's a beautiful detail. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2792.2400000000002s)]
*  They end up slashing themselves with knives. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2795.04s)]
*  They're trying to get the gods to respond. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2797.48s)]
*  It's a beautiful image of what happens to us in idolatry. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2800.48s)]
*  We end up harming ourselves in a frenzied attempt [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2803.36s)]
*  to get gods to answer who can never in principle answer. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2807.08s)]
*  Now think of someone addicted to power, sex, money, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2810.48s)]
*  a pleasure, whatever it is. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2814.2s)]
*  And I'm begging, begging, begging, you will satisfy me. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2815.7599999999998s)]
*  It won't, because it can't. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2818.7999999999997s)]
*  And I'll end up harming myself. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2820.7599999999998s)]
*  Then Elijah calls upon the true God. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2822.8799999999997s)]
*  The fire comes, it takes the sacrifice. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2825.8799999999997s)]
*  It's not just a jingoistic story. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2829.48s)]
*  It's a very powerful story. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2831.2799999999997s)]
*  That the true God is the only one that can satisfy [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2833.2799999999997s)]
*  the longing of the heart, right? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2836.2799999999997s)]
*  And so idolatry will always lead us down [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2838.44s)]
*  this self-destructive path. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2840.96s)]
*  And the worship of the true God is what's gonna lead us [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2844.68s)]
*  to the fire falling on us. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2847.2s)]
*  A lot of the news you read doesn't really have [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2849.76s)]
*  a lot of inherent meaning, but this does. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2852.68s)]
*  Starting May 19th, the Hallow App is leading a consecration [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2855.44s)]
*  to Jesus through Saint Joseph. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2859.84s)]
*  You might be asking, why Saint Joseph? [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2862.04s)]
*  Why now? [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2863.56s)]
*  Well, consider this, Joseph was the man God himself [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2864.64s)]
*  trusted with his own son. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2867.28s)]
*  He wasn't a king or a warrior, he was a carpenter. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2868.76s)]
*  He was a quiet and steady man of unshakable faith. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2871.5200000000004s)]
*  In an age that mocks humility, can you imagine the basis [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2875.44s)]
*  of wisdom and relationship with God? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2879.5600000000004s)]
*  It's time we looked to someone who embodied humility, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2881.5200000000004s)]
*  not for applause, but for God. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2884.36s)]
*  The series is not just about Saint Joseph, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2886.76s)]
*  it's about what happens when you follow his example. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2888.32s)]
*  When you trade noise for silence, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2890.8s)]
*  when you stop chasing relevance and start seeking holiness. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2892.88s)]
*  And all of that begins with humility, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2896.6800000000003s)]
*  which is really just perspective. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2898.6s)]
*  You are not God. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2899.72s)]
*  It's important to remind yourself of that. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2900.88s)]
*  We do every day. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2902.4s)]
*  So every week on Hallow, you'll hear reflections [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2903.64s)]
*  grounded in the Gospels, pray powerful prayers [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2905.88s)]
*  like the Litany of Saint Joseph, and hear glory stories [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2908.2799999999997s)]
*  from throughout church history, not myths, not legends, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2911.12s)]
*  actual intersections, and power from a saint [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2913.4s)]
*  who's been quietly helping people for thousands of years. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2916.4s)]
*  Hallow is the world's number one prayer app, [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2920.6s)]
*  and experiences like this are why my family [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2922.64s)]
*  and I cannot get enough of it. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2924.7599999999998s)]
*  It is a constant dinner table conversation. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2926.04s)]
*  So you get three months right now [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2929.36s)]
*  at Hallow.com slash Tucker for free. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2931.08s)]
*  You'll be glad you did Hallow.com slash Tucker. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2933.56s)]
*  Why does God require sacrifice? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2937.08s)]
*  He doesn't require it. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2939.8s)]
*  And that's a super important point. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2940.64s)]
*  The Bible and the great tradition [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2943.88s)]
*  make it over and over again. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2945.0s)]
*  How could the one who made the entire universe [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2946.44s)]
*  from nothing possibly need anything from it? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2949.32s)]
*  And it's just a logical contradiction. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2952.92s)]
*  The ancient gods of Greece, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2955.88s)]
*  sure, they need all kinds of stuff. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2957.52s)]
*  Remember that scene, it's in the Odyssey, I think, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2959.52s)]
*  where as the sacrifices are being made [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2963.36s)]
*  and the gods are desperately lapping up [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2965.92s)]
*  the blood of the sacrifice [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2969.6400000000003s)]
*  because they need our loyalty and so on. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2970.76s)]
*  Psalm 50, you think I need these? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2976.32s)]
*  You think I drank the blood of goats? [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2979.76s)]
*  Are you joking? [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2981.4s)]
*  All the animals in the field, they all belong to me. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2982.2400000000002s)]
*  But that's a very important point [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2985.92s)]
*  because it's not that we're playing some game [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2986.7599999999998s)]
*  of like codependency with God. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2989.3199999999997s)]
*  God needs nothing. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2992.44s)]
*  That's the best news ever. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2993.48s)]
*  God needs nothing from us. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2994.7599999999998s)]
*  What he wants is the openness of heart [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=2996.96s)]
*  signaled by the sacrifice [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3001.52s)]
*  because he wants us to be alive. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3003.48s)]
*  And when we say, Lord, I'm opening my heart to you. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3006.0s)]
*  I'm ordering my life to you [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3010.04s)]
*  in this great sacrifice of praise, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3012.2s)]
*  God delights because now we're gonna find [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3015.2799999999997s)]
*  the joy he wants us to have. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3018.6s)]
*  That's St. Irenaeus, my great intellectual hero. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3020.8399999999997s)]
*  The glory of God is a human being fully alive. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3023.7599999999998s)]
*  The glory of God is not putting us down [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3027.3199999999997s)]
*  and boy, they finally got around to honoring me sufficiently. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3029.48s)]
*  So that's old paganism, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3033.08s)]
*  but it haunts the Christian mind still. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3035.68s)]
*  It haunts our minds. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3038.08s)]
*  But the Bible is always trying to dismiss that demon. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3039.64s)]
*  God wants our sacrifice because it's good for us. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3044.32s)]
*  God gets nothing out of it. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3047.6800000000003s)]
*  Think of it, it bounces off of the rock [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3049.7200000000003s)]
*  of the divine self-sufficiency [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3053.6000000000004s)]
*  and comes back to our benefit. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3055.92s)]
*  So when I pray to God, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3058.2000000000003s)]
*  I offer the sacrifice of the mass to God. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3060.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not giving God anything he needs. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3063.1200000000003s)]
*  God needs nothing. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3064.76s)]
*  But it bounces off of that self-sufficiency to me. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3065.92s)]
*  It redounds to my benefit. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3069.4s)]
*  So go into the Catholic mass. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3071.64s)]
*  We offer the sacrifice of Jesus to the Father. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3075.04s)]
*  We represent the sacrifice of the cross to the Father. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3078.08s)]
*  Oh, because the Father needs it. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3081.0s)]
*  The Father needs nothing. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3082.52s)]
*  But it bounces off of the Father's self-sufficiency [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3084.24s)]
*  and comes back as food for us. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3086.8399999999997s)]
*  So now we eat, we eat the body and drink the blood of Jesus. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3089.3599999999997s)]
*  We consume the sacrifice. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3092.8399999999997s)]
*  It's for our benefit, not for God's. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3094.44s)]
*  But your question is really a good one [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3097.64s)]
*  because it leads us into that very important spiritual space. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3099.8s)]
*  One of the reasons I think Christianity is true [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3104.5600000000004s)]
*  is because so many people hate it. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3106.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3108.6400000000003s)]
*  And Jesus is really the great dividing, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3109.6000000000004s)]
*  the great divider. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3113.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3114.48s)]
*  And why would you be mad at Jesus or Christianity [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3115.52s)]
*  when it's like a non-violent religion [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3119.5600000000004s)]
*  that teaches people to love each other? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3121.76s)]
*  If you're mad at that, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3123.5600000000004s)]
*  it says something about how real it is, I think. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3125.28s)]
*  I agree. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3128.52s)]
*  Both Billy Graham and Fulton Sheen, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3129.32s)]
*  I mean, argued with the two greatest evangelists of the 20th century, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3131.56s)]
*  said the same thing, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3134.88s)]
*  which was the objection to God is rarely truly intellectual. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3135.8s)]
*  It's a moral objection. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3139.48s)]
*  Totally. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3140.68s)]
*  The moral demand of God becomes too great. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3142.32s)]
*  See, Jesus, if he's one spiritual figure among many, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3146.36s)]
*  he's a great teacher, like the Buddha, he's like Mohammed, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3149.8s)]
*  he's like Confucius. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3152.96s)]
*  Well, then I can kind of handle him. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3154.92s)]
*  I can put him in a corner and say, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3156.16s)]
*  OK, that's interesting, I'll abide by some of that. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3157.32s)]
*  And I also like what the Sufi mystics say, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3159.52s)]
*  and I also like what Moses says here. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3161.6800000000003s)]
*  But see, Jesus, as C.S. Lewis saw so perfectly, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3163.96s)]
*  is qualitatively different than that. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3168.96s)]
*  And that's why he's a problem. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3171.6000000000004s)]
*  Because if he is who he says he is, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3173.2000000000003s)]
*  not just one teacher that I can listen to, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3176.0400000000004s)]
*  but he's God from God, light from light, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3178.96s)]
*  true God from true God, begot not made, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3181.0400000000004s)]
*  consubstantial with the Father. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3183.6400000000003s)]
*  As we say every week in the Creed. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3185.52s)]
*  Him all things were made. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, if that's who he is, well, the game's over. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3188.4s)]
*  But why does it make people mad? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3192.0s)]
*  I mean, one of the late life revelations in my life [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3194.04s)]
*  has been that these great spasms of violence, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3197.7200000000003s)]
*  these revolutions that we study, French Revolution, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3200.28s)]
*  Spanish Civil War, Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3202.8s)]
*  huge parts of World War II, were anti-Christian. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3206.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3208.84s)]
*  The point was to murder Christians. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3209.6800000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, yeah. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3210.52s)]
*  But it's not recorded that way. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3211.34s)]
*  Yeah, but that's true. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3212.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but see, Jesus, he's a problem [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3214.52s)]
*  because of who he says he is, but also we're sinners. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3216.68s)]
*  And so sinners don't wanna get out of their sinful patterns. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3219.92s)]
*  They're way too comfortable. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3223.12s)]
*  It's like the Israelites that wanna go back to Egypt, right? [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3225.04s)]
*  They're on their way to liberation. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3227.56s)]
*  But oh boy, did we love the flesh pots of Egypt. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3229.44s)]
*  At least we had cucumbers. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3232.92s)]
*  And all that. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3234.44s)]
*  Right? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3235.28s)]
*  That's my favorite part. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3236.1s)]
*  Right, but see, that's the story of every sinner. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3236.94s)]
*  Every sin is a type of addiction. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3240.0s)]
*  You're addicted to, you know, that's the presa vial. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3242.28s)]
*  And so as I'm trying to move toward conversion, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3245.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm moving across the painful desert, right, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3247.0400000000004s)]
*  on the way to the promised land, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3250.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm always hankering for Egypt. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3251.6400000000003s)]
*  And so Jesus is a constant reproach, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3253.5600000000004s)]
*  a constant challenge, a constant no-no, you know? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3256.1600000000003s)]
*  So of course I'm gonna resist him. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3259.1600000000003s)]
*  Look at, you know, the very fact, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3261.7200000000003s)]
*  I think this is very interesting. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3263.28s)]
*  Muhammad dies in his bed full of years. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3265.76s)]
*  The Buddha dies in his bed full of years, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3268.4s)]
*  surrounded by his disciples. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3270.62s)]
*  Confucius, the same thing. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3271.7799999999997s)]
*  Moses dies at the age of 120 or something, you know? [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3273.02s)]
*  And then there's Jesus, who dies 30 years old, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3277.06s)]
*  naked, pinned to a desperate instrument of torture. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3280.7799999999997s)]
*  His disciples having abandoned him, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3285.8199999999997s)]
*  his enemies mocking him. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3288.06s)]
*  That's how he dies. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3289.74s)]
*  Now, what does it tell you? [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3291.18s)]
*  It tells you there's something about him. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3292.06s)]
*  Well, who would write that? [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3294.42s)]
*  By the way, if I'm trying to create a new religion, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3295.5s)]
*  No way, you'd write- [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3298.18s)]
*  He's not the hero I'm creating. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3299.02s)]
*  No, but he's a sign of contradiction. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3301.2200000000003s)]
*  He's the one that, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3303.54s)]
*  that's the way the world is gonna react to him. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3304.9s)]
*  Now, what's the good news? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3307.46s)]
*  The good news is having endured all of that, he returns. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3308.82s)]
*  And I always think of this, you know, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3313.26s)]
*  if we were, if Holly was telling the story, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3315.06s)]
*  you never heard the Jesus story, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3317.1s)]
*  but here's this guy, this horrible thing, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3318.5s)]
*  and these people betrayed him and denied him, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3320.7400000000002s)]
*  and they crucified him, and now he's back. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3322.5s)]
*  I'd be back with a machine gun. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3325.98s)]
*  I'm back for vengeance. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3327.38s)]
*  He's back with shalom, a word of peace. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3329.1s)]
*  And the way I put it in Christianity is this, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3332.7s)]
*  we killed God and God returned in forgiving love. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3335.14s)]
*  And that's why, as Paul said, right, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3339.46s)]
*  I'm certain neither death nor life nor angels [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3342.38s)]
*  nor principalities nor height nor depth [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3345.18s)]
*  nor anything else could ever separate us from love of God. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3347.2999999999997s)]
*  How does Paul know that? [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3351.42s)]
*  Because we killed God and God returned in forgiving love. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3352.66s)]
*  That's salvation. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3357.02s)]
*  That's the word of grace, if you want. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3358.66s)]
*  That's the good news. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3360.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what they went, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3361.7799999999997s)]
*  careering around the world to their deaths, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3362.74s)]
*  proclaiming was that, you know, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3364.7s)]
*  Paul, I preach one thing, Christ and him crucified, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3366.7s)]
*  because that's the message is we killed him, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3369.58s)]
*  God raised him up, and he returned in forgiving love. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3372.9s)]
*  You know, that's the good news. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3375.7s)]
*  Do you think that Christian persecution is on the rise? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3379.7s)]
*  Oh, I know it is. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3384.18s)]
*  It's documented. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3385.02s)]
*  20th century was the worst century for Christian martyrs [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3386.82s)]
*  of all of Christian history, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3389.5400000000004s)]
*  all the previous centuries combined. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3391.3s)]
*  There were more martyrs in the 20th century [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3392.9s)]
*  than any other time. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3394.5800000000004s)]
*  We think of all the early church, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3395.5800000000004s)]
*  they were all being persecuted. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3396.86s)]
*  Far greater 20th century. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3398.1800000000003s)]
*  Now, around the world, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3399.5800000000004s)]
*  we are by far the most persecuted religion, absolutely. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3401.1400000000003s)]
*  And it's a crime, it's an outrage. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3404.5s)]
*  And we talk about, in a kind of demure way [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3407.02s)]
*  about religious liberty in our country, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3409.1000000000004s)]
*  which is indeed under threat, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3410.5400000000004s)]
*  but you want the real threat to religious liberty. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3412.3s)]
*  It's in different parts of the world. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3414.42s)]
*  People are being killed for their Christian faith. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3416.02s)]
*  So why is that fact suppressed? [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3417.78s)]
*  That is intentionally suppressed. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3420.7s)]
*  Again, I was like 45 before I realized [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3422.34s)]
*  the Bolshevik Revolution was aimed at Christians. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3424.62s)]
*  I don't know why I didn't get that, but I didn't. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3426.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I have to ask the keepers of the flame culturally, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3428.78s)]
*  but it's simply the case today. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3433.22s)]
*  I mean, it's the most persecuted religion. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3436.22s)]
*  You know, we look at things from different angles, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3439.58s)]
*  I suppose. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3441.5s)]
*  One tragedy, let's say the 20th century, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3442.34s)]
*  you have World War I and World War II. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3444.94s)]
*  Yes, there are anti-Christian elements to be sure. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3448.34s)]
*  I mean, Hitler is deeply anti-Christian. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3450.82s)]
*  But you also had French Christians [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3453.1s)]
*  killing German Christians, killing Canadian Christians, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3455.5s)]
*  killing American Christians, killing Russian Christians. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3458.42s)]
*  It said it was this massive Christian slaughter bench. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3461.54s)]
*  And my pet theory is, when you go to Europe today, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3466.3s)]
*  especially parts of Europe, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3469.1s)]
*  and you see a kind of spiritual wasteland, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3470.54s)]
*  I think that's a big part of that is, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3475.38s)]
*  we're just recovering from this horrific outbreak [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3477.78s)]
*  of Christian on Christian violence. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3482.34s)]
*  The gospel, did that get into anybody's mind and heart [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3485.82s)]
*  in the 20th century that allowed this orgy of violence [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3489.2200000000003s)]
*  to take place? [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3492.78s)]
*  What do you think that was? [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3493.62s)]
*  Why the 20th century? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3495.78s)]
*  Well, you could do a- [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3497.54s)]
*  So much darker than anything that happened [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3498.7400000000002s)]
*  in the dark ages. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3500.14s)]
*  You could do the Leo the 13th, you know, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3501.1s)]
*  who gave us the St. Michael prayer. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3502.9s)]
*  Who supposedly had a intuition or a sense [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3505.02s)]
*  that the 20th century would belong to the devil. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3509.3s)]
*  And to my mind, it's kind of hard to argue with that. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3511.6600000000003s)]
*  If you believe in the devil, as I do, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3515.1s)]
*  and you see what happened in the 20th century, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3517.34s)]
*  it's kind of hard to imagine it wasn't to some degree. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3519.78s)]
*  Well, nuclear weapons are proof, as far as I can tell. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3522.58s)]
*  I know, I mean, the mass destruction, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3524.98s)]
*  mass death of the 20th century, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3527.38s)]
*  it's hard to blame that simply on political reality. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3529.7400000000002s)]
*  Right, totally. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3532.7s)]
*  Wait, I'm sorry, I interrupted you. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3533.94s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3534.94s)]
*  You said Pope Leo the 13th had, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3535.7799999999997s)]
*  can you explain what you mean he had this sense? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3539.98s)]
*  He had a mystical experience. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3542.02s)]
*  The devil would have a unique control [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3544.22s)]
*  over the 20th century. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3547.3s)]
*  And so he formulates the famous St. Michael prayer [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3548.18s)]
*  that we still pray in many churches, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3550.5s)]
*  asking for the protection of Michael the archangel. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3552.7799999999997s)]
*  When did he have this experience? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3555.2599999999998s)]
*  Toward the end of his life. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3557.06s)]
*  So he died 1903, so it would have been like around 1900, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3557.94s)]
*  so late 19th century. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3561.5s)]
*  And many would say, well, it was born out [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3564.14s)]
*  by the 20th century. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3567.2200000000003s)]
*  I would. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3568.06s)]
*  Like, you know, for me, in my own lifetime, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3568.9s)]
*  you see, when I was a young guy going through school, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3571.5s)]
*  we were still very much formed [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3573.9s)]
*  by more liberal Catholic view. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3575.18s)]
*  The devil, literary device, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3577.78s)]
*  literal as a symbol for evil, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3579.98s)]
*  don't take it literally. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3582.94s)]
*  You were taught that? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3584.26s)]
*  Yeah, it was sort of the standard view. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3585.14s)]
*  But you know what really convinced me powerfully [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3587.9s)]
*  of the devil's reality was the sex abuse scandal. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3590.82s)]
*  Cause you look at the sex abuse scandal, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3594.1800000000003s)]
*  which has haunted almost the whole of my priesthood. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3595.46s)]
*  It broke in Chicago in the early 90s. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3597.7000000000003s)]
*  I was ordained in 1986. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3600.1000000000004s)]
*  So most of my priesthood has been under the shadow. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3602.1000000000004s)]
*  The clergy sex abuse scandal [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3604.9s)]
*  has adversely affected the church in every possible way. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3607.26s)]
*  And you look at it and you say, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3612.5800000000004s)]
*  could that have just been an accident [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3615.1800000000003s)]
*  or just human folly and sin? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3618.42s)]
*  It seemed to have been so designed by a wicked mind [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3621.14s)]
*  that wanted to undermine the church. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3625.7000000000003s)]
*  But then, now look at the whole 20th century [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3628.02s)]
*  and the level of destruction and degradation. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3630.46s)]
*  It's hard for me to imagine it's just because [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3634.7400000000002s)]
*  of political forces or cultural- [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3637.26s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3639.3s)]
*  I've come to this conclusion recently, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3640.9s)]
*  but I think you're exactly right. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3642.3s)]
*  So what's the St. Michael's Prayer that was- [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3643.66s)]
*  St. Michael the Archangel defend us in battle. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3645.62s)]
*  I won't get it exactly right, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3647.42s)]
*  but it's an invocation of St. Michael [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3648.6600000000003s)]
*  to defend us in battle against the devil [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3650.5s)]
*  who sends his minions for the destruction of souls. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3652.6600000000003s)]
*  So it's a very conscious awareness [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3655.6600000000003s)]
*  of the presence of evil in the world. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3657.6600000000003s)]
*  And Pope Leo said, the 13th said, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3659.9s)]
*  I think this century is gonna be done. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3662.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it belonged to the devil. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3663.9s)]
*  And he formulated that prayer [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3665.3s)]
*  to be prayed in Catholic churches. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3666.38s)]
*  What do people say when he said that? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3667.7000000000003s)]
*  I think most of them followed him. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3669.98s)]
*  I think most of them started saying that prayer. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3671.3s)]
*  1903 was a period of great hope in the West. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3673.1400000000003s)]
*  Which is fascinating to me. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3676.3399999999997s)]
*  There's a magazine called The Christian Century. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3678.2599999999998s)]
*  It's a Christian theological journal. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3680.9s)]
*  And it was born at that time. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3683.98s)]
*  And that's the idea is this is the Christian century. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3685.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3688.14s)]
*  That progress and economic progress [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3688.98s)]
*  and dominating the world. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3691.06s)]
*  And the social gospel, and this is our century. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3692.18s)]
*  And then it didn't exactly work out that way. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3695.62s)]
*  Leo intuited or had a mystical experience to the effect [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3699.3399999999997s)]
*  that it would belong not to the Christian churches, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3702.98s)]
*  but to the devil. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3705.22s)]
*  So we got a battle on our hands, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3706.5s)]
*  but we most of forget what we were saying earlier. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3708.22s)]
*  We're sin abounds, grace abounds the more. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3711.74s)]
*  The gates of hell will not prevail against the church. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3713.8999999999996s)]
*  That image too, I don't know why, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3717.02s)]
*  but for most of my life, [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3719.66s)]
*  okay, the gates of hell will not prevail against it, [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3722.2599999999998s)]
*  which means somehow hell is gonna come against us, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3724.02s)]
*  but we're gonna win the battle. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3726.7799999999997s)]
*  But that's not what it means. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3728.02s)]
*  The gates would be the weakest point of a city wall. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3730.18s)]
*  And so when you're attacking a city, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3733.5s)]
*  you go after the gates. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3735.9s)]
*  So what the Lord is saying is, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3737.66s)]
*  no, no, you're not defensive here. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3739.98s)]
*  You're on the march. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3741.86s)]
*  You're on the offensive. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3743.06s)]
*  And the gates of hell will not prevail against you. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3744.46s)]
*  You're gonna win. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3748.18s)]
*  You're invading hell, [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3749.06s)]
*  and it's not gonna prevail against you. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3750.66s)]
*  So it's like not a cowering, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3752.54s)]
*  like, oh, we'll put up a good defense, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3754.54s)]
*  and I guess we're gonna- [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3756.42s)]
*  Or move as far away from hell as we can. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3757.26s)]
*  We are on the march. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3759.02s)]
*  Move to the suburbs. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3760.38s)]
*  No, but see, one of the problems is [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3761.22s)]
*  when Christians forget that [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3762.98s)]
*  and they hand the world over to pure secularism or whatever, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3764.62s)]
*  well, of course we're not gonna do well in the battle. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3770.02s)]
*  But when Christians know, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3772.1s)]
*  no, our job is to be fully engaged in this great struggle. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3773.06s)]
*  And we're going after you, hell. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3776.94s)]
*  We're coming after hatred, violence, stupidity, [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3779.42s)]
*  superstition, scapegoating. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3782.7000000000003s)]
*  We're going after you. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3785.9s)]
*  We're on the march. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3788.62s)]
*  When I was coming of age, [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3791.5s)]
*  we didn't have that language. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3792.66s)]
*  Why? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3794.3799999999997s)]
*  It was an attempt. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3796.14s)]
*  I know, because the people that taught me were good people, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3797.46s)]
*  and they were positively motivated. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3800.46s)]
*  I know that for sure. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3803.06s)]
*  They felt the church needed to be relevant [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3804.8199999999997s)]
*  to the modern world, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3806.98s)]
*  and that the modern world should set the agenda [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3808.2599999999998s)]
*  for the church. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3812.3799999999997s)]
*  That was a big part of the mentality. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3813.2s)]
*  That we had been in a fortress too long. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3815.2999999999997s)]
*  We'd been in a defensive crouch. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3817.94s)]
*  We had demonized the world, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3820.14s)]
*  and so now we need to go out to the world [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3821.62s)]
*  in a confident spirit. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3823.38s)]
*  And that's definitely the Catholicism I got as a young man. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3824.98s)]
*  But see, here's something I've always found kind of puzzling. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3828.2999999999997s)]
*  So I come of age right after the Second Vatican Council, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3830.98s)]
*  which ended 1965. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3834.2999999999997s)]
*  I went to first grade in 1966, right? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3835.98s)]
*  So that's the church that I inherited very much. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3839.2999999999997s)]
*  Vatican II was written by people [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3842.58s)]
*  who had experienced the worst of the 20th century. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3845.06s)]
*  Mostly European intellectuals, [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3849.3399999999997s)]
*  French, German, a lot of them. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3850.7799999999997s)]
*  Americans too, some Italians, Swiss, right. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3852.8599999999997s)]
*  Are the people that wrote Vatican II. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3855.14s)]
*  And they experienced some of the worst horrors [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3858.8599999999997s)]
*  in human history. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3862.1s)]
*  So Vatican II is a direct response to the Second World War. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3862.9399999999996s)]
*  No, I wouldn't say that. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3866.02s)]
*  Vatican II, look, let me talk about it positively. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3867.5s)]
*  Vatican II was a missionary council. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3871.8999999999996s)]
*  I think the best people at Vatican II felt [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3873.4599999999996s)]
*  the church has been crouching behind walls for too long, [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3875.8199999999997s)]
*  and it should go out not to conform to the modern world, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3879.38s)]
*  but to go out to convert the modern world. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3883.1800000000003s)]
*  It's how do we get the church to engage modernity [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3885.7000000000003s)]
*  in a confident spirit? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3888.5s)]
*  I think that people like De Lubach and von Balthasar [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3891.3s)]
*  and Voitiwa and Ratzinger, these people, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3894.1s)]
*  that's what they had in mind. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3897.26s)]
*  Now, what the church became after the council, [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3899.26s)]
*  that's a different story. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3902.42s)]
*  What developed after the council, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3903.9s)]
*  that's the church that I came of age in. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3906.1s)]
*  And I think that was a too apologetic church. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3908.1s)]
*  That was a church that, in fact, lost a missionary edge. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3911.06s)]
*  It was more of the conformity to the world. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3914.82s)]
*  The world sets the agenda for us. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3917.58s)]
*  That was a distortion of Vatican II. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3919.86s)]
*  But that's the church that formed a lot of people [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3922.82s)]
*  in my generation. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3924.54s)]
*  Do you think that the sex abuse was a result of Vatican II? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3925.38s)]
*  Not Vatican II per se. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3932.06s)]
*  I would say more the result of the sexual revolution [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3933.2999999999997s)]
*  and of a loosening of moral strictures. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3936.74s)]
*  There was, I sense this even as a young man, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3941.14s)]
*  there was a sense of, you know, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3944.62s)]
*  we've repressed stuff too long [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3946.7s)]
*  and we really need to be more expressive [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3947.9399999999996s)]
*  and there's too much of this obsession with sexual sin. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3950.3799999999997s)]
*  And then the whole culture was going through [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3953.58s)]
*  a sexual revolution and stop repressing [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3956.4599999999996s)]
*  and be yourself and express what you're feeling. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3959.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think a lot of priests, frankly, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3961.54s)]
*  got caught up in that cultural movement. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3965.02s)]
*  And because we can measure it. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3968.02s)]
*  The sex abuse, the clergy sex abuse spiked [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3970.98s)]
*  by the 70s into the very early 80s [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3974.1s)]
*  and then it began going down. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3977.46s)]
*  And then after 2002, when the church put in [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3979.38s)]
*  all kinds of important restrictions, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3981.98s)]
*  the so-called Dallas Accords being first among them, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3984.42s)]
*  it's fallen off the table. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3988.18s)]
*  The statistics have gone completely down. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3989.58s)]
*  So we can measure a spiking of it [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3991.86s)]
*  right at the height of the sexual revolution. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3993.7s)]
*  I think that's responsible for a lot of it. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3996.58s)]
*  What were the changes brought by Vatican too? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=3999.22s)]
*  There was famously the change in language of the mass [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4002.8599999999997s)]
*  from Latin to colloquial. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4005.8999999999996s)]
*  But I learned recently that there were [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4007.8999999999996s)]
*  what seemed like theological changes to church doctrine. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4010.5s)]
*  Is that fair? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4013.14s)]
*  No, not really. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4013.98s)]
*  I would say there was development of doctrine. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4014.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm using John Henry Newman's language there. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4017.02s)]
*  Newman says that doctrine is not just [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4019.06s)]
*  handing out like a football, you know, [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4021.18s)]
*  from one generation to the other. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4022.54s)]
*  It unfolds more like a river expanding [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4023.7799999999997s)]
*  or like a tree growing. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4026.7799999999997s)]
*  So doctrine doesn't turn back on itself, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4028.98s)]
*  but it can grow and express itself in fresh ways. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4031.86s)]
*  For example, the ecclesiology of Vatican too, [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4035.94s)]
*  the understanding of the church and its nature [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4039.46s)]
*  underwent a real development at Vatican too. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4042.34s)]
*  Moving away from a, let's say, highly juridical [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4046.1s)]
*  to a more organic sense of the church. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4050.3s)]
*  The church not crouching defensively, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4053.3s)]
*  but the church going out in a confident missionary spirit. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4055.3s)]
*  The church is the people of God, not just the hierarchy. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4058.34s)]
*  All of that stuff would be emphases within Vatican too. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4061.7000000000003s)]
*  They represent not a repudiation [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4064.6600000000003s)]
*  of the previous ecclesiology, but a development of it. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4066.3s)]
*  The role of the laity in the world. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4070.38s)]
*  That's around from the beginning of the church, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4072.5800000000004s)]
*  but it had been muted. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4074.34s)]
*  Prior to the council, laity were, you know, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4075.98s)]
*  come to mass on Sunday, yes, and say your prayers [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4077.7000000000003s)]
*  and donate to the church and all that. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4079.94s)]
*  Where Vatican too said, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4081.78s)]
*  no, your job is to Christify the world. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4082.6200000000003s)]
*  You're meant to go out into business, finance, [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4085.02s)]
*  entertainment, sports, education, everything, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4087.46s)]
*  and Christify the world. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4090.02s)]
*  Well, that's a real development. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4091.42s)]
*  I say a healthy development of doctrine. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4092.5800000000004s)]
*  I agree. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4094.38s)]
*  At Vatican too. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4095.2200000000003s)]
*  So that's how I read it. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4096.04s)]
*  And again, do Vatican too, [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4097.02s)]
*  but then the post-conciliar period, [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4099.14s)]
*  which was often not all that faithful to Vatican too. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4101.900000000001s)]
*  It would be more faithful to the spirit of the world. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4104.54s)]
*  Were there any changes [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4106.74s)]
*  in the way the gospel story was told? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4107.58s)]
*  Well, no, except, you know, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4110.74s)]
*  the vernacular at the mass makes the whole liturgy [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4112.38s)]
*  more accessible to people. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4115.0199999999995s)]
*  I think, I don't even know, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4117.18s)]
*  because it's before my time, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4118.26s)]
*  that the gospel was still read, I think, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4119.34s)]
*  in the vernacular before the council. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4121.34s)]
*  We got greater exposure to the Bible. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4124.66s)]
*  After Vatican too, they opened up more of the Bible to us. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4128.0599999999995s)]
*  But I don't think the way the gospel story was told, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4131.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't think that changed. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4133.1s)]
*  The church seems to be readjusting in a new direction now. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4135.34s)]
*  Is that fair? [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4140.9800000000005s)]
*  With Pope Leo, you mean? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4141.82s)]
*  Well, if that just happened. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4143.66s)]
*  No, but I mean, well, I'll just be totally blunt. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4144.62s)]
*  So the Catholic church got in American political terms, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4147.1s)]
*  which are pretty limited way to describe it, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4150.18s)]
*  but got super liberal. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4151.9s)]
*  The Jesuits, the Marian Ols, pretty liberal, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4153.58s)]
*  is my non-Catholic perspective. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4155.78s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, everywhere you look, [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4157.74s)]
*  people you know are converting to Catholicism [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4160.62s)]
*  with a pretty kind of traditionally Christian orientation. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4162.98s)]
*  Is that real, do you think? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4166.0599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's going on today. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4167.179999999999s)]
*  We have to go back, let's say, when I was a kid, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4169.78s)]
*  there was that liberalization for sure. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4172.099999999999s)]
*  What I was describing is the church or the world [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4174.179999999999s)]
*  setting the agenda for the church, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4177.0599999999995s)]
*  that's kind of a liberal move. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4178.58s)]
*  A tendency, and this is how I would characterize [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4180.219999999999s)]
*  ecclesial liberalism, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4182.66s)]
*  a tendency to reduce the supernatural to the natural. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4184.299999999999s)]
*  So instead of emphasizing the supernatural dimension, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4187.42s)]
*  God, Trinity, grace, salvation, Jesus, cross, [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4190.46s)]
*  resurrection, eternal life, right? [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4193.38s)]
*  A tendency to say, what the church is really all about is [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4195.66s)]
*  social justice and racial justice [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4199.06s)]
*  and economic justice and so on. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4201.54s)]
*  Where indeed, those are implications from our doctrine. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4203.78s)]
*  And indeed, the church is interested [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4207.5s)]
*  in transforming the world, true. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4209.1s)]
*  But the liberal tendency is to reduce the supernatural [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4211.1s)]
*  to the natural. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4214.14s)]
*  That was going on for a long time, yes. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4215.42s)]
*  And the change commenced really [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4217.66s)]
*  with like a John Paul II, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4219.5s)]
*  it's been happening now for many decades. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4220.62s)]
*  In very recent years, to your point, I think, yes, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4222.94s)]
*  there's been a keener interest in [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4226.66s)]
*  the supernatural dimension of the faith. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4229.42s)]
*  Why would you go to church if it's not supernatural? [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4231.86s)]
*  Which is a darn good question. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4234.5s)]
*  But again, the instinct, I get it, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4236.42s)]
*  all my teachers felt this way when I was a kid. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4237.9s)]
*  Well, we don't wanna be irrelevant. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4240.9s)]
*  The church is all about the world and we're engaged [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4242.78s)]
*  and we're not just running off to heaven [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4245.9s)]
*  or pie in the sky when you die. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4248.14s)]
*  They tended to think of it in a very dualistic way. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4250.5s)]
*  Why? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4255.660000000001s)]
*  That's such an interesting, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4256.5s)]
*  it's kind of the last impulse you would think [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4257.9800000000005s)]
*  in someone who's devoted his life to [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4259.820000000001s)]
*  being a member of the clergy. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4262.58s)]
*  Yeah, and I kind of share your puzzlement in a way with it, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4264.780000000001s)]
*  but it was the church that I took in as a kid. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4268.3s)]
*  But it was not just the Catholics who did this. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4271.06s)]
*  No, right, right. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4273.22s)]
*  Totally eliminated mainstream Protestantism [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4274.06s)]
*  with these ideas. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4276.900000000001s)]
*  And we keep analyzing the thing too, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4278.219999999999s)]
*  is the supernatural during the modern period [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4280.179999999999s)]
*  and then into the postmodern period [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4283.62s)]
*  is subject to a withering criticism [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4285.58s)]
*  on the part of secularists, rationalists, [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4288.139999999999s)]
*  the scientific mentality and materialistic mentality. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4290.86s)]
*  So if you accept that criticism, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4293.94s)]
*  all the supernatural mumbo jumbo, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4296.26s)]
*  so what's left is, well, it's moral commitment. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4298.5s)]
*  We're good people. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4302.46s)]
*  The other thing, if you wanna do it philosophically, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4303.34s)]
*  the influence of Immanuel Kant, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4306.0199999999995s)]
*  and I might be boring your audience with this, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4307.9s)]
*  but Immanuel Kant, late 18th century, [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4311.459999999999s)]
*  the most influential of the modern philosophers, [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4314.0199999999995s)]
*  writes a book called [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4316.339999999999s)]
*  Religion Within the Limits of Reason Alone. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4317.179999999999s)]
*  Extremely important text. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4320.219999999999s)]
*  Hilarious title. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4322.0599999999995s)]
*  Yes, actually it is. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4323.299999999999s)]
*  As if you can have a religion within the limits of reason. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4324.139999999999s)]
*  Right, but that's- So funny. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4326.98s)]
*  As he's an enlightenment figure, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4328.099999999999s)]
*  think Thomas Jefferson, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4329.099999999999s)]
*  cutting all the supernatural parts out of the Bible, right? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4330.78s)]
*  Same instinct. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4332.98s)]
*  But Kant said, religion is finally all about [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4334.14s)]
*  being an ethically upright person. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4337.18s)]
*  And so worship and liturgy and doctrine and miracles [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4339.02s)]
*  and all that, fine, fine, fine. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4342.62s)]
*  If it leads you to moral rectitude. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4344.700000000001s)]
*  Well, see, I think we drank deeply [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4348.22s)]
*  from the wells of Kantianism. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4350.26s)]
*  A lot of Christians did. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4351.62s)]
*  And they said, well, all right, [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4353.5s)]
*  when push comes to shove, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4354.62s)]
*  what it's really all about is, am I a dedicated person? [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4356.42s)]
*  And that now, because of the critique of sexual morality, [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4359.9400000000005s)]
*  it took the form of social justice morality. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4364.82s)]
*  So the way you prove that you're a religious person [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4366.7s)]
*  is not, do I believe in the Trinity so much? [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4369.459999999999s)]
*  It's, am I committed to social justice? [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4371.78s)]
*  I think it's a sort of popular Kantianism [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4374.5s)]
*  that was imbibed by the Christian churches, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4377.139999999999s)]
*  very much including my own. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4379.219999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4381.139999999999s)]
*  And again, it completely destroyed [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4381.98s)]
*  American Protestantism, mainline Protestantism. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4383.54s)]
*  Quite right. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4385.74s)]
*  I completely agree with that. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4386.58s)]
*  And we see the, it's heartbreaking really. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4387.74s)]
*  We see the ruins of Christian churches [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4390.7s)]
*  because of that Kantian move. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4392.58s)]
*  Literally the ruins. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4394.1s)]
*  I mean, it's a physical ruins. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4394.94s)]
*  Like the roof has fallen in, no one's going. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4396.58s)]
*  Yes, because again, to your point, why would they bother? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4398.74s)]
*  If you're a dedicated political person [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4401.42s)]
*  and your political party is focused on these things too, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4404.14s)]
*  why would you need to go to church to talk about it? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4406.7s)]
*  No, it was a disaster of the last about 50 years [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4410.82s)]
*  in the Christian churches. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4413.98s)]
*  And do you feel like that's changing in the Catholic church? [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4415.34s)]
*  Yes, no, I do. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4420.5s)]
*  See, the supernatural has a way of reasserting itself. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4423.34s)]
*  Being supernatural. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4426.94s)]
*  Yes, its death has been predicted so many times [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4428.42s)]
*  in so many different circles. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4430.78s)]
*  Enlightenment most famously. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4432.82s)]
*  But look, the Enlightenment was a long time ago [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4434.1s)]
*  and religion's still around. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4436.34s)]
*  I have an internet ministry and I used to do it more. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4439.46s)]
*  I'd go on the comment section to respond to people, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4441.9800000000005s)]
*  but you still hear it. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4444.42s)]
*  People say, you know, religion, its days are numbered. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4445.66s)]
*  I think, oh buddy, they've been saying that [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4448.62s)]
*  for like hundreds of years. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4450.42s)]
*  And it's not, it works out. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4453.38s)]
*  But it's still this prejudice that somehow science [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4454.66s)]
*  and we're gonna knock religion out. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4458.3s)]
*  Religion keeps reasserting itself. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4460.78s)]
*  For all the reasons we were saying [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4462.54s)]
*  in the first part of our conversation, [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4463.9s)]
*  it's because all those spiritual and metaphysical truths, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4465.34s)]
*  they don't go away. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4468.7s)]
*  We can hope they go away or pretend they go away, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4470.14s)]
*  but they don't go away. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4472.9800000000005s)]
*  They reassert themselves. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4474.46s)]
*  And the deepest reason is we're made in the image [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4475.9800000000005s)]
*  and likeness of God. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4477.9800000000005s)]
*  So there's a hunger in us for God. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4479.14s)]
*  That's why it's reasserting itself even now. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4482.42s)]
*  You often hear, and it's accepted uncritically [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4485.58s)]
*  or was when I was a kid anyway, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4488.02s)]
*  that religion, Christianity leads to violence. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4489.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4493.54s)]
*  You know, and that was really the drive. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4494.38s)]
*  I mean, Hitchens, who I knew well, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4495.58s)]
*  that was his main argument. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4496.9800000000005s)]
*  People get, you know, inflexible when they believe [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4498.06s)]
*  in the supernatural and they have to kill anyone [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4501.18s)]
*  who disagrees. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4503.86s)]
*  But does the historical record support that claim? [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4505.02s)]
*  No, and of course that's a great myth. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4508.62s)]
*  There was a book done some years ago. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4511.02s)]
*  I forget the title of it now, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4513.1s)]
*  but a guy that did a very careful study [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4513.9400000000005s)]
*  of all the great wars going back, you know, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4515.1s)]
*  like a couple of thousand years. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4517.34s)]
*  And the conclusion was something like 8% [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4518.54s)]
*  could be traced to a religious cause. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4521.3s)]
*  But that's part of enlightenment historiography. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4523.54s)]
*  It's one of the myths of enlightenment historiography, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4525.780000000001s)]
*  that religion is the problem. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4528.7s)]
*  And see that it's the origin myth of modernity. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4530.46s)]
*  Modernity emerged out of the myths [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4533.820000000001s)]
*  of a superstitious religion [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4536.06s)]
*  and out of a primitive pre-science, let's say. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4538.22s)]
*  And so we have to readily bring out [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4542.7s)]
*  these sort of boogeymen to knock down again. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4545.06s)]
*  Like, yeah, religion bad, superstition bad. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4547.54s)]
*  And look at now this enlightenment reason, enlightenment. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4551.66s)]
*  But no, that's all simplistic, you know. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4555.740000000001s)]
*  And it betrays a deep lack of appreciation [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4560.3s)]
*  for the intellectual tradition within the religious sphere. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4563.96s)]
*  But that's part of the way they've told the story. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4568.9400000000005s)]
*  And of course, may I say too about violence? [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4572.3s)]
*  I always have to smile when people, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4574.1s)]
*  oh, religion is a source of violence. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4575.9400000000005s)]
*  Give me a break. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4577.780000000001s)]
*  Look at the 20th century. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4578.620000000001s)]
*  I mean, the corpses piled up in the 20th century [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4579.9800000000005s)]
*  and it was not religion that did it. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4582.58s)]
*  It was deeply anti-religious ideology. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4584.740000000001s)]
*  So it was murdering religious people. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4586.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, I'll take lectures on violence from many people, [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4588.5s)]
*  but not from the avatars of modern secularism, you know. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4590.58s)]
*  And sure, there's distortions of religion [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4594.9800000000005s)]
*  and bad religious people that did things in its name. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4597.46s)]
*  But you can't talk about the risen Jesus [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4600.18s)]
*  still bearing his wounds [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4602.78s)]
*  and with the word of shalom on his lips [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4604.28s)]
*  and say that's a religion of violence. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4606.34s)]
*  It's a religion that shows God [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4608.5s)]
*  absorbing the violence of the world. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4610.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4613.34s)]
*  You know, Jordan Peterson, I think, [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4614.18s)]
*  made a very important observation about the cross [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4615.66s)]
*  when he said, there's no other story. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4619.34s)]
*  In fact, you couldn't imagine a story [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4621.58s)]
*  that shows more of human degradation [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4623.5s)]
*  in the cross of Jesus. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4626.08s)]
*  That's right. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4626.92s)]
*  Physical suffering, psychological suffering, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4628.16s)]
*  death itself, the abandonment by your friends, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4630.92s)]
*  betrayal, denial, institutional injustice. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4633.2s)]
*  It's all there. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4636.72s)]
*  As I said earlier, this 30 year old man [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4638.0199999999995s)]
*  dying naked on this instrument of torture. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4639.64s)]
*  Well, there it is, you know. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4642.0s)]
*  There's the totality of human dysfunction. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4643.96s)]
*  And God's response to that is not to more violence. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4647.12s)]
*  It's to respond with forgiving love. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4652.08s)]
*  That's Christianity. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4654.44s)]
*  Now the distortions of it are everywhere, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4656.92s)]
*  but that's Christianity. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4658.88s)]
*  It's not a religion of violence. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4660.44s)]
*  It's so non-obvious. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4661.52s)]
*  It's so preposterous and crazy [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4663.04s)]
*  that the fact that that became the world's [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4665.52s)]
*  most popular religion tells you it's true. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4667.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4670.64s)]
*  Like, who could make that up? [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4671.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4673.36s)]
*  It's so unappealing. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4674.2s)]
*  Like your God got tortured to death and didn't fight back. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4675.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4679.08s)]
*  It's the weird, I wrote a little book years ago [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4679.92s)]
*  called The Strangest Way. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4682.2s)]
*  The Strangest Way. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4684.08s)]
*  And it's a book about Christianity. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4685.12s)]
*  Because that's the argument I made was [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4686.44s)]
*  this is the weirdest religious path ever. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4687.96s)]
*  Because again, when I was coming of age, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4690.6s)]
*  it was very much all religions, you know, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4692.2s)]
*  they're kind of the same and we all claim the holy mouth [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4693.68s)]
*  of different paths. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4695.72s)]
*  No, I completely repudiate that now. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4696.84s)]
*  Completely repudiate that. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4699.96s)]
*  I'm with Tom Holland, you know, not Spider-Man, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4701.5199999999995s)]
*  but the popular historian, Tom Holland, you know, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4703.92s)]
*  a book called Dominion Wonderful. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4707.08s)]
*  Oh, I read Dominion. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4708.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4709.72s)]
*  But that's his argument is things that we just think are, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4710.56s)]
*  you know, blessed as part of the way things are. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4714.3s)]
*  No, it's Christianity bequeathed. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4715.42s)]
*  That's a great book. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4717.86s)]
*  It's a great book, yeah. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4718.7s)]
*  Yes. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4719.54s)]
*  Christianity bequeathed to the West. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4720.38s)]
*  These deeply weird ideas like we're all equal, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4722.62s)]
*  we're all subjects of dignity, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4725.98s)]
*  that you should care for the poor and the marginalized. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4728.54s)]
*  And they didn't just come up out of enlightenment rationalism, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4731.66s)]
*  they came up out of Christianity. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4734.42s)]
*  That weakness is something we should celebrate. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4736.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, that'd talk about counterintuitive. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4738.42s)]
*  And you say, okay, God, give me an image of your God. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4740.74s)]
*  And mighty, you know, kings and all this. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4744.02s)]
*  There's our image of God, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4746.14s)]
*  is that 30 year old rabbi on the cross. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4747.38s)]
*  Whose closest friends didn't really believe in him. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4750.74s)]
*  Right, close friends ran away. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4753.62s)]
*  You know, it's like the most pathetic story [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4755.18s)]
*  you could imagine. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4757.18s)]
*  And we say, that's the manifestation of God. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4758.3s)]
*  But if you were making it up, you would hide all that. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4759.74s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4761.78s)]
*  No, it's the last story in the world [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4762.78s)]
*  you'd dream of making up. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4764.92s)]
*  It's the opposite of the story you'd make up. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4766.58s)]
*  The gospels are all like that. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4769.74s)]
*  They're strange and weird and wonderful. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4771.42s)]
*  So it does seem like you were saying [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4774.660000000001s)]
*  that Kant was the root of the ideas [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4776.660000000001s)]
*  that led to the French Revolution and Auschwitz [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4779.620000000001s)]
*  and like, you know, every, I agree with you. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4782.02s)]
*  But the Kant sort of began writing [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4784.780000000001s)]
*  at the beginning of a technological revolution. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4788.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4791.660000000001s)]
*  And as technology advanced, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4792.580000000001s)]
*  first incrementally, then exponentially, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4795.9800000000005s)]
*  and now we're on the verge of like singularity with AI, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4797.580000000001s)]
*  those ideas became stronger and more dominant. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4801.86s)]
*  So there's a connection between technology [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4804.42s)]
*  and the belief that man is God [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4807.46s)]
*  and all the suffering that results. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4809.339999999999s)]
*  Oh, they became very dangerous. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4811.0199999999995s)]
*  So technology is not bad in itself. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4812.379999999999s)]
*  But when you couple technology [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4814.0199999999995s)]
*  with a sheer celebration of autonomy [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4815.339999999999s)]
*  or a bracketing of God, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4817.86s)]
*  I don't blame poor Kant for that. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4819.339999999999s)]
*  And Kant had a very vivid sense of God as a moral guide. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4820.9s)]
*  But you do indeed with someone like Nietzsche, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4824.58s)]
*  you know, you get to a sense of, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4827.78s)]
*  Uwe mentioned, and it's just, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4829.7s)]
*  it's human autonomy expressing itself. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4831.06s)]
*  That's a very dangerous combination. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4833.14s)]
*  And you bring high technology into that [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4834.9800000000005s)]
*  and you don't anchor it in something of spiritual, moral, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4837.14s)]
*  welcome to the 20th century. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4842.860000000001s)]
*  But the 21st century sees a continuation of those trends, [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4844.66s)]
*  like in a way that you couldn't even imagine 15 years ago [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4847.9800000000005s)]
*  or 25 years ago at the end of the last century. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4850.46s)]
*  So like, where are we going? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4852.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4854.02s)]
*  That's the whole AI thing, which, you know, [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4854.860000000001s)]
*  I kind of have to understand, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4856.66s)]
*  but it always makes me nervous [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4857.62s)]
*  when I think about it and I see instances of it, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4858.78s)]
*  of chat GPT and all that. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4861.38s)]
*  And it's kind of amazing, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4862.58s)]
*  like most technology breaks through like, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4863.82s)]
*  oh my gosh, that guy can actually compose a novel [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4865.58s)]
*  in a minute or whatever it is. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4867.98s)]
*  But it's frightening because it's got to be grounded [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4870.66s)]
*  in a moral vision. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4873.58s)]
*  It has to be, or it will become a Frankenstein's monster. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4874.54s)]
*  I mean, she saw that by the way, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4878.0599999999995s)]
*  it's very interesting about Mary Shelley. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4879.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, she saw that coming. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4880.3s)]
*  She saw exactly what will happen when we become God, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4882.3s)]
*  we decide to dictate terms to reality, [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4885.42s)]
*  it'll turn on us and wreck us. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4888.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's a very prescient novel. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4891.02s)]
*  Yeah, it feels Tower of Babel-y a little bit. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4893.54s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4895.9400000000005s)]
*  Although the Bible knew all about it. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4896.78s)]
*  Yes, so how does the individual respond to this? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4898.46s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, I would say that keep, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4903.9800000000005s)]
*  the awakening of the moral sensibility [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4908.1s)]
*  and a ground of your life in God, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4910.9800000000005s)]
*  you're not the center of the universe, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4913.7s)]
*  the decentering of the ego. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4916.62s)]
*  I mean, all those spiritual practices [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4918.139999999999s)]
*  would be essential to a rightly ordered world. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4920.38s)]
*  But yeah, we have a dangerous weapon in front of us. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4923.66s)]
*  And that's what you do, the churches can't seed the ground. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4927.62s)]
*  I mean, C-E-D-E, the ground. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4931.3s)]
*  We can't withdraw to the sidelines. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4932.9s)]
*  The churches have got to be front and center [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4934.9s)]
*  in shaping the consciousness of our people. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4937.26s)]
*  See, in the measure that we become [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4941.54s)]
*  just a faint echo of the culture, that's very dangerous. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4943.14s)]
*  Because the very weirdness of Christianity [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4946.62s)]
*  that we were talking about, that's got to be front and center. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4948.94s)]
*  It's got to be front and center. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4951.7s)]
*  See, when I was coming of age, [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4953.86s)]
*  the churches were made to look like they're just blending [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4954.9s)]
*  into the suburban environment. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4957.98s)]
*  That's the emblematic of the time. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4960.26s)]
*  Make the church just so you can barely see it. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4963.7s)]
*  The medieval cathedrals looked like Tibetan temples. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4966.54s)]
*  They were wildly colored and rising up like monsters. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4971.42s)]
*  But that's, because they were speaking of another world [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4976.7s)]
*  and you go through the door, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4978.54s)]
*  not like you're entering a bank, [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4980.1s)]
*  which is the way a lot of our churches feel now. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4981.38s)]
*  Like you're entering another world. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4983.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4985.5s)]
*  That to me is emblematic of what the churches [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4986.5s)]
*  should be like today on the scene. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4988.78s)]
*  We've got to be a very strong presence. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4991.82s)]
*  But the stronger the presence of Christianity, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4995.14s)]
*  the more vehement the persecution. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=4998.46s)]
*  Yes, and see, they know at some level, [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5002.22s)]
*  when I say they, I mean the enemies of the church, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5004.46s)]
*  they know in some way we are the enemy that matters. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5006.860000000001s)]
*  Yes, I totally agree. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5011.06s)]
*  We're the enemy that matters. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5011.900000000001s)]
*  And that's why they go after us. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5012.9800000000005s)]
*  That's how they convinced me it was real. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5014.700000000001s)]
*  I mean, because I spent my whole life watching [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5016.42s)]
*  what the enemies of civilization do, that's like my job. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5019.1s)]
*  And the thing that triggers them most of all is Jesus. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5022.38s)]
*  Like there's nothing that comes close. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5025.14s)]
*  And I think the whole point of the trance thing [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5026.74s)]
*  was just to like figure out who believes in Jesus [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5028.1s)]
*  and who doesn't. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5030.18s)]
*  That's my personal view. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5031.38s)]
*  But whatever. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5032.54s)]
*  No, we're the enemy and that's true. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5033.42s)]
*  And they know it, they intuit that. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5035.7s)]
*  But see, the gates of hell will not prevail against us. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5038.42s)]
*  So we should go forth with panache and with confidence. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5040.900000000001s)]
*  Panache. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5045.42s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5046.26s)]
*  You're the only person in America who's used that word today. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5047.22s)]
*  And I love it, a forgotten word. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5049.5s)]
*  But how does the individual believer respond to persecution? [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5051.78s)]
*  Well, it depends where you are. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5056.5s)]
*  I mean, there's some, I know these believers in Nigeria [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5057.34s)]
*  who are under very direct persecution. [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5059.66s)]
*  And they've responded, I think beautifully, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5062.42s)]
*  by 94% of them coming to mass every Sunday. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5064.219999999999s)]
*  That's an act of resistance. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5067.62s)]
*  Persecution, if you could just put a finer point on it, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5069.0599999999995s)]
*  by which you mean like denial of federal contracts? [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5071.259999999999s)]
*  No, I mean, threat to your life and limbs. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5073.46s)]
*  Like the headache, yeah. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5076.62s)]
*  Yeah, there are people being killed all over the world [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5077.46s)]
*  for their Christianity today. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5079.78s)]
*  In our country, of course, it takes a subtler form. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5081.9400000000005s)]
*  And we're being persecuted institutionally in different ways [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5084.62s)]
*  and they're trying to get us off the stage. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5087.22s)]
*  I was a bishop for six years in California, [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5089.62s)]
*  auxiliary of LA. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5091.900000000001s)]
*  And there's no question, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5093.02s)]
*  the government wanted us out of healthcare. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5094.78s)]
*  They want us out of education. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5097.26s)]
*  They want us off the public stage. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5099.26s)]
*  And in using all kinds of different strategies. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5101.5s)]
*  And we resisted it successfully in some cases, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5106.18s)]
*  not so much in others. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5109.900000000001s)]
*  But they definitely want us off the stage [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5110.9s)]
*  because we are the principal enemy. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5112.98s)]
*  So they didn't want you healing the sick [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5115.62s)]
*  or educating the kids for free? [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5117.259999999999s)]
*  They don't want- For free? [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5119.259999999999s)]
*  No, because there's a, as you just were suggesting, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5120.74s)]
*  there's an ideology in place [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5123.299999999999s)]
*  that they want all the kids to subscribe to. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5124.78s)]
*  And we stand to thwart that. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5126.82s)]
*  We have a different anthropology. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5128.379999999999s)]
*  And they want hospitals where abortion and euthanasia [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5131.54s)]
*  and all that, and where gender surgery is being done. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5134.179999999999s)]
*  And the church has to stand against that. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5136.94s)]
*  What's wrong with euthanasia? [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5139.34s)]
*  Whether you live or you die, you're the Lord's. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5142.02s)]
*  My life doesn't belong to me. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5144.66s)]
*  And it's not a matter of my autonomy deciding, [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5146.78s)]
*  oh, now it's time for me to get off the stage. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5149.74s)]
*  That belongs to God. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5152.46s)]
*  So it's another expression of the deification [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5154.58s)]
*  of the autonomous will. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5157.54s)]
*  Is I determine how I live, how long I live and all that. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5158.9800000000005s)]
*  And the church says, no, no, you belong to God. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5162.66s)]
*  That's gonna be a battle that we're all gonna be fighting, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5165.780000000001s)]
*  or witness to soon, right? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5169.74s)]
*  Before we fought in California, [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5171.7s)]
*  and it's in so many states, euthanasia. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5172.9800000000005s)]
*  I think it's a very demonic manifestation. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5175.9800000000005s)]
*  And so is the transgender surgery stuff. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5178.780000000001s)]
*  My home state now in Minnesota, it's a sanctuary state. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5181.54s)]
*  So kids can, without their parents' permission, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5184.9400000000005s)]
*  can be brought to Minnesota [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5186.7s)]
*  to have gender reassignment surgery. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5187.9400000000005s)]
*  I think that's as, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5190.54s)]
*  perverse as it gets. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5192.1s)]
*  So as believers say, like what you just said, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5195.9800000000005s)]
*  they're gonna be, well, they are already being punished [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5199.700000000001s)]
*  in the state of Minnesota and in the state of California. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5201.860000000001s)]
*  How do they respond to that punishment? [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5204.1s)]
*  Well, I guess it depends on the person. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5208.38s)]
*  And the church at its leadership level [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5211.3s)]
*  has tried to affect an organized response. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5213.660000000001s)]
*  So on a regular basis, I mean, I'm not saying [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5217.42s)]
*  that the church is gonna be punished, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5219.3s)]
*  but on a regular basis, I'm chair right now [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5220.94s)]
*  of our bishops committee on Lady, Youth, and Family Life. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5222.9s)]
*  And we've issued strong statements. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5226.219999999999s)]
*  We meet as bishops with the leadership of Minnesota [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5229.42s)]
*  once a year, so we met with the governor, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5232.259999999999s)]
*  we met with most of the top leadership. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5233.74s)]
*  We lay out our positions on things. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5235.94s)]
*  In California, what does the governor say? [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5239.219999999999s)]
*  Not much that's helpful. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5242.0199999999995s)]
*  California, there was a law, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5245.58s)]
*  now one like it just passed in Washington state, [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5246.7s)]
*  in California to compel priests [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5249.42s)]
*  to break the seal of confession [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5251.74s)]
*  in the case of child sex abuse. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5253.02s)]
*  And we fought that and we roused the people [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5255.46s)]
*  and the people inundated Sacramento [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5258.38s)]
*  with so many petitions that they dropped it. [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5260.42s)]
*  So we figured that was a victory. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5262.58s)]
*  But these battles are just ongoing. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5265.14s)]
*  That's why religious liberty [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5266.62s)]
*  is a serious issue in our country. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5267.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, Christians should be prepared to suffer, correct? [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5271.3s)]
*  They should be, yeah, yeah. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5274.18s)]
*  Do you think they are? [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5275.900000000001s)]
*  Well, I think at their best [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5278.1s)]
*  and some of the best would be, [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5279.780000000001s)]
*  but I think we've been out of practice in a way [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5281.58s)]
*  that we've so internalized practices of accommodation [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5284.620000000001s)]
*  that it's probably hard to imagine [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5288.740000000001s)]
*  that we would be standing a thwart, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5290.9800000000005s)]
*  let's say a government or standing a thwart, a law. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5294.06s)]
*  I think for a lot of Catholics, [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5296.900000000001s)]
*  that would still be still kind of a new idea. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5297.740000000001s)]
*  But maybe that's the challenge of our time. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5300.38s)]
*  You keep hearing reports of people [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5303.58s)]
*  imputing supernatural power to AI. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5307.02s)]
*  And you hear very credible reports, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5311.1s)]
*  and in fact are true, that it acts autonomously, [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5313.78s)]
*  that it lies to the people who created it, for example. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5317.22s)]
*  That's real. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5319.9800000000005s)]
*  Do you see a spiritual component to that? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5322.22s)]
*  What is that? [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5324.860000000001s)]
*  I wish I knew more about it. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5325.860000000001s)]
*  I've been involved in a couple of conferences about AI. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5327.1s)]
*  And when people start talking about it, [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5329.42s)]
*  I always go back to Thomas Aquinas and those people [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5331.06s)]
*  that no matter what this thing is, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5334.0199999999995s)]
*  which I would say is mimicking consciousness, [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5336.419999999999s)]
*  it's not conscious, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5338.62s)]
*  consciousness has to involve something immaterial. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5339.82s)]
*  As I was saying earlier, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5342.58s)]
*  if you're entertaining a pure mathematical idea [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5343.5s)]
*  or pure abstraction, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5346.78s)]
*  that's a sign that your mind is not simply [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5348.139999999999s)]
*  ordered to the material. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5351.419999999999s)]
*  And the brain might explain imagination, [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5353.0199999999995s)]
*  but it can't explain pure conceptualization. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5356.58s)]
*  I don't think a machine is in principle capable [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5359.98s)]
*  of real conceptualization and real [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5363.74s)]
*  intellection and will. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5368.3s)]
*  So whatever's going on with AI is a simulacrum [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5370.42s)]
*  of consciousness, not the real thing. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5373.0199999999995s)]
*  Now having said all that, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5375.22s)]
*  it doesn't take away the fact that you just said, [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5376.26s)]
*  might they develop in a way that's really repugnant [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5378.5s)]
*  to our own interests? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5381.66s)]
*  And I think yes, the answer to that is yes. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5383.0199999999995s)]
*  And yeah, I worry about that. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5385.66s)]
*  The Vatican I know is very interested. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5387.5s)]
*  They've had several conferences on AI. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5389.0199999999995s)]
*  One of the first things the Pope said, [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5390.7s)]
*  our new Pope was about AI. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5392.06s)]
*  So it's on their mind for sure that it's talk about [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5394.14s)]
*  your Frankenstein's monster, right? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5396.54s)]
*  This thing that we've created that might turn on us. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5397.9800000000005s)]
*  So I see all that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5401.22s)]
*  The new Pope's American from the Midwest. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5403.18s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5405.740000000001s)]
*  Do you know him? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5407.02s)]
*  A little bit. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5408.26s)]
*  We grew up about a 25 minute drive from each other. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5409.860000000001s)]
*  So I grew up in Western Springs. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5412.9400000000005s)]
*  He grew up in Dalton, [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5414.5s)]
*  which is just off the South side of the city. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5415.38s)]
*  I was in the Southwest suburbs where he's about four years [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5417.820000000001s)]
*  older than I am. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5420.900000000001s)]
*  So we're around the same age. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5422.42s)]
*  He would have come of age as an Augustinian, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5423.26s)]
*  which meant he was in the order side of things. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5424.94s)]
*  I came of age as a Diocesan priest. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5427.3s)]
*  So we didn't really share an educational background. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5429.099999999999s)]
*  I came to know him a little bit at the last two synods. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5432.46s)]
*  So the last two Octobers under Pope Francis, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5435.0599999999995s)]
*  we had these synods gathering about 400 people, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5437.9s)]
*  300 bishops, about a hundred lay people [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5441.38s)]
*  to talk about a lot of important issues. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5443.62s)]
*  So for two Octobers, the current Pope and I [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5446.86s)]
*  were both at the synod. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5450.5s)]
*  So in that capacity, I saw him, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5452.02s)]
*  I talked to him a couple of times. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5453.9s)]
*  He's a very quiet man, very kind of reserved. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5455.54s)]
*  We talked a little bit about Chicago, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5460.66s)]
*  a shared background there. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5462.26s)]
*  I was never at a table with him at the synod, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5464.14s)]
*  but I know someone who was, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5466.58s)]
*  and he said he was by far the quietest guy at the table, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5468.18s)]
*  which I thought was interesting. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5471.98s)]
*  Yeah, he interviewed, we all had a chance, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5473.54s)]
*  I think once or twice to speak to the plenary session. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5475.66s)]
*  And he spoke, I remember in Spanish, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5478.86s)]
*  I frankly don't recall what he said, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5481.339999999999s)]
*  but so I had a little contact with him, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5483.339999999999s)]
*  but I don't know him that well. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5485.42s)]
*  What changes do you think he'll make? [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5486.62s)]
*  I don't know is my honest answer. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5489.46s)]
*  So far he's made some interesting gestures, I think. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5491.099999999999s)]
*  The fact that he appeared on the Loggia [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5493.9s)]
*  with the, what we call the Mosetta and the elaborate stole, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5495.38s)]
*  traditional garb for the newly elected Pope. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5499.259999999999s)]
*  Francis eschewed that famously. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5502.38s)]
*  So this Pope brought it back. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5504.219999999999s)]
*  He's used Latin a lot more, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5507.0599999999995s)]
*  which is kind of interesting. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5509.3s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5511.42s)]
*  And they say- [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5512.26s)]
*  What does that mean that he used? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5513.08s)]
*  What significance would you ascribe to that? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5514.0599999999995s)]
*  I think it was a gesture toward more traditional Catholics. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5516.5s)]
*  Francis would have seen it as a gesture [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5520.62s)]
*  toward poverty and simplicity. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5522.34s)]
*  And I think this current Pope would see it as what he did, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5524.82s)]
*  a gesture toward the more traditionally minded Catholics [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5527.66s)]
*  that like the liturgy and so on. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5530.18s)]
*  The use of Latin and all that. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5534.46s)]
*  Those are little indicators. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5535.98s)]
*  They say he's gonna move back in the Apostolic Palace. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5537.22s)]
*  Francis famously moved into the guest house, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5539.860000000001s)]
*  which is, I stayed there one time during a conference [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5542.42s)]
*  and it's like a three-star hotel. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5545.14s)]
*  So he lived, pretty simply. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5549.740000000001s)]
*  They say that it was harder to protect him there, [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5552.14s)]
*  which I get. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5554.5s)]
*  The palace is easy to protect the Pope. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5555.46s)]
*  But this current Pope, they say, is gonna move back in. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5558.38s)]
*  So there are little gestures perhaps, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5560.5s)]
*  but I don't think we know. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5562.62s)]
*  So one thing we know would be the name, Leo XIV. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5564.26s)]
*  The name is always a giveaway. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5567.62s)]
*  And he said it was indeed in tribute to Leo XIII, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5570.06s)]
*  who was one of the most consequential Popes. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5573.5s)]
*  And we mentioned already that St. Michael's Prayer. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5575.54s)]
*  That he had a vision that the 20th century [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5578.38s)]
*  would be controlled by Satan. Right, would belong [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5579.860000000001s)]
*  to the devil. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5581.14s)]
*  But he's also the father of the modern Catholic [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5582.3s)]
*  social teaching tradition, beginning with his famous letter [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5584.54s)]
*  called Rerum Novarum, which means about the new things. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5587.74s)]
*  And that's a very interesting letter, Rerum Novarum. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5590.900000000001s)]
*  What does he say? [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5593.86s)]
*  Well, among many others, fierce opposition to socialism, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5594.7s)]
*  fierce defense of private property, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5599.139999999999s)]
*  zero truck with Marxism. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5601.179999999999s)]
*  That's very clear. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5602.94s)]
*  And by that time, you know, Marxism was kind of a coming [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5604.339999999999s)]
*  thing by the late 19th century. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5607.099999999999s)]
*  So very clear on that. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5608.66s)]
*  On the other hand, it's the first great ecclesial gesture [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5610.5s)]
*  toward unions, that labor unions were good. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5613.9s)]
*  But it also invoked a principle that goes back to Aquinas, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5618.38s)]
*  but behind Aquinas, it goes back to the church fathers [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5623.26s)]
*  and the Bible, which is called the universal destination [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5625.66s)]
*  of goods. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5629.06s)]
*  And what that means is, since the whole world belongs [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5629.900000000001s)]
*  to God, ultimately, right? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5632.900000000001s)]
*  God makes the whole world from nothing. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5634.42s)]
*  It belongs to God. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5636.14s)]
*  It doesn't belong to us. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5637.42s)]
*  We are stewards of it, to use biblical language, right? [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5638.74s)]
*  So Leo said, everyone has a right to private ownership, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5642.22s)]
*  private property. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5647.780000000001s)]
*  I own this house or whatever. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5648.62s)]
*  But when it comes to the use of what we own, he said, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5650.34s)]
*  once the requirements of necessity and propriety [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5655.900000000001s)]
*  have been met in your own life, everything else you own [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5660.9800000000005s)]
*  belongs to the poor. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5664.54s)]
*  That's Leo the 13th. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5666.3s)]
*  That's pretty strong statement. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5667.66s)]
*  So private property, yep, you got a right to it. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5669.26s)]
*  But is your life basically okay and necessity, propriety, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5671.82s)]
*  you know? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5676.7s)]
*  Yeah, I'm doing all right. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5677.54s)]
*  Well, then everything else you have belongs to the poor. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5678.94s)]
*  That the common good should be your primary preoccupation. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5682.86s)]
*  It was Ambrose of Milan who said, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5687.94s)]
*  if you've got two shirts in your closet, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5690.62s)]
*  one belongs to you. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5693.379999999999s)]
*  The other belongs to the man who has no shirt. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5694.94s)]
*  So that's the tradition. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5697.46s)]
*  And that goes back to the Hebrew prophets, right? [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5698.46s)]
*  It goes back to Amos and Isaiah and those people. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5700.259999999999s)]
*  So that's what that letter is about. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5703.179999999999s)]
*  And it's echoed by all the popes coming up [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5705.7s)]
*  through the 20th century, including up to Francis, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5708.26s)]
*  the idea of the universal destination of goods. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5710.5s)]
*  So it's not, it's certainly, it's against socialism, [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5713.14s)]
*  against Marxism. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5715.780000000001s)]
*  We like the market economy. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5716.62s)]
*  That's a basic principle of Catholic social teaching. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5717.9400000000005s)]
*  We like the market economy. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5720.7s)]
*  But we're not laissez-faire, anything goes, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5722.900000000001s)]
*  make as much money as you want, sort of a capitalist. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5726.18s)]
*  Opposed to accumulation of wealth for its own sake? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5729.54s)]
*  Well, you know, with Catholic social teaching, [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5732.18s)]
*  I'll put it positively, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5733.780000000001s)]
*  what it likes is a wide distribution of wealth and power [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5734.66s)]
*  throughout a society. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5739.74s)]
*  It doesn't like hyper concentrations of wealth and power. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5741.34s)]
*  Communists! [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5745.14s)]
*  No, see, that's the thing, is it fiercely anti-communistic? [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5746.099999999999s)]
*  But because the communist system always winds up [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5749.0199999999995s)]
*  with a hyper concentration of wealth and power. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5751.0599999999995s)]
*  Right, and the church would never recommend [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5753.74s)]
*  that the government should be the agent [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5755.78s)]
*  of that distribution. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5757.86s)]
*  It would encourage mediating institutions [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5759.14s)]
*  and all this sort of thing. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5762.18s)]
*  Read someone like Tolkien or Lewis in the 20th century, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5763.38s)]
*  and you'll find echoes of that sort of sensibility. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5767.3s)]
*  Look at it in The Lord of the Rings, [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5771.1s)]
*  when power gets concentrated, it's always something bad. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5773.02s)]
*  And Tolkien likes the shire, he likes the small businesses [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5776.42s)]
*  and small homes and all that. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5780.42s)]
*  That's reflective of Catholic social teaching. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5782.38s)]
*  So I think it's intriguing that this man took the name [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5784.82s)]
*  Leo XIV, clearly in homage. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5787.02s)]
*  Where was Leo XIII on loaning money to interest, [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5789.5s)]
*  which is the basis of the modern economy in the West? [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5793.5s)]
*  The church has been against it for time immemorial. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5797.179999999999s)]
*  Now the transition that took place was once we kind of [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5799.82s)]
*  understand the dynamics of a market economy better, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5802.54s)]
*  what it tends to mean now is loaning at exorbitant interest [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5806.66s)]
*  or loaning in a way that's deeply abusive toward others. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5812.099999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean that in itself, it's intrinsically evil, [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5815.339999999999s)]
*  because then the capitalists think about that. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5818.62s)]
*  So how would the church feel about like a credit card [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5819.54s)]
*  that charges 25% interest? [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5822.06s)]
*  Yeah, it would be wary of it. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5823.740000000001s)]
*  It would be wary of it and would want some kind of [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5826.18s)]
*  regulation and some kind of oversight of those things. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5829.02s)]
*  John Paul II would say the economy needs to be regulated [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5832.3s)]
*  morally and legally. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5835.620000000001s)]
*  So there should be a moral regulation. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5836.860000000001s)]
*  And see, that comes from the churches. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5839.22s)]
*  It comes from a clear teaching about the moral life [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5841.1s)]
*  and care for the poor and so on. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5843.22s)]
*  But also a legal regulation to some degree. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5844.900000000001s)]
*  The best statement of it, I think, is John Paul II, [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5848.5s)]
*  he's called Centesimus Annus, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5850.98s)]
*  written in 1991 on the Centesimus Annus, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5853.0599999999995s)]
*  the 100th year of Rerum Novarum. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5856.86s)]
*  That's the clearest expression, I think, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5859.379999999999s)]
*  of the balance of Catholic social teaching. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5861.5s)]
*  I think this man is signaling that he likes that tradition. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5864.5s)]
*  And what did he say about usury? [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5867.299999999999s)]
*  He didn't talk about usury specifically, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5870.74s)]
*  but he has a paragraph where he says, [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5873.0599999999995s)]
*  do we support the market economy? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5875.219999999999s)]
*  If by that you mean, [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5877.62s)]
*  one that encourages entrepreneurship, [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5878.94s)]
*  that is based upon private property, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5881.099999999999s)]
*  that allows even for a profit motive, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5883.299999999999s)]
*  and he goes through various things, the answer is yes. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5885.299999999999s)]
*  If by that you mean, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5887.74s)]
*  one that is completely unregulated, legally or morally, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5888.86s)]
*  one that exploits the poor, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5891.58s)]
*  one that excludes most people from participation in it, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5893.139999999999s)]
*  then the answer is no. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5896.0599999999995s)]
*  And so he kind of sets the parameters [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5897.339999999999s)]
*  for how we think about the economy. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5899.339999999999s)]
*  Is that, that feels, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5902.86s)]
*  I mean, I'm so grateful to the Catholic Church [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5905.339999999999s)]
*  for standing up for life, for opposing killing. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5907.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5909.5s)]
*  Truly grateful and for emphasizing the poor. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5910.54s)]
*  I think someone needs to. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5914.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5915.660000000001s)]
*  I'm grateful that the Catholic Church [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5916.5s)]
*  has never stopped doing that. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5917.34s)]
*  But I don't hear any conversation ever [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5918.740000000001s)]
*  from normal Catholic clerics about, [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5923.06s)]
*  hey, maybe you shouldn't exploit people in business. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5926.58s)]
*  We should though. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5929.46s)]
*  That's part of our social teaching. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5930.3s)]
*  And that's part of where the instruction should come from [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5931.62s)]
*  is the pulpit. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5933.9400000000005s)]
*  Has that broken down generally in our society? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5935.46s)]
*  Probably. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5939.139999999999s)]
*  But that's part of the church's job [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5941.98s)]
*  is to preach that clearly. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5943.38s)]
*  And that's where, that's people like Dorothy Day, [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5945.259999999999s)]
*  the founders of the Catholic Worker Movement [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5947.58s)]
*  would come in these sort of more radical voices. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5949.139999999999s)]
*  But sometimes you have to shout to get people's attention. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5951.5s)]
*  And I think Dorothy Day is a good example [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5954.34s)]
*  of someone that she reverenced [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5956.219999999999s)]
*  the Catholic social teaching tradition, [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5957.42s)]
*  but she felt that in certain ways it had been so ignored [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5959.46s)]
*  that she needed to shout. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5962.98s)]
*  Last question. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5965.74s)]
*  If someone's made it to the end of this conversation [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5966.58s)]
*  and is wondering like, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5970.299999999999s)]
*  how do I learn more about this religion called Christianity? [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5971.339999999999s)]
*  What's a good place to start? [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5976.58s)]
*  It's the risk of being self-serving [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5980.0599999999995s)]
*  with our word on fire materials. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5982.66s)]
*  But the Bible is always the best place to start. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5983.98s)]
*  Oh, the Bible. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5986.82s)]
*  Is the best place to start. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5987.66s)]
*  But I know for a lot of people, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5989.66s)]
*  the Bible can be very difficult. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5990.86s)]
*  Just trying to plow through it. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5993.14s)]
*  I mentioned that by ministry word on fire, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5994.66s)]
*  we have an edition of the Bible that I think is beautiful. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=5996.7s)]
*  It's full of great artwork, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6000.62s)]
*  but also it's got the biblical text, [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6001.94s)]
*  but then surrounded by, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6004.62s)]
*  literally surrounded on the page by commentary [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6006.1s)]
*  from the church fathers and the great saints [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6008.5s)]
*  and the popes and so on. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6011.42s)]
*  So that as you read the Bible, [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6012.94s)]
*  wait, I'm lost. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6014.7s)]
*  I don't know what's going on. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6015.7s)]
*  Okay, read this commentary. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6016.54s)]
*  That might be a good way for someone to get into it. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6018.18s)]
*  Word on fire. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6021.3s)]
*  Go back to mass too, I say to Catholics. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6023.06s)]
*  The fact that in our country now, [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6025.740000000001s)]
*  18 or 19% of Catholics go to mass on Sunday, [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6028.900000000001s)]
*  that's a rotten shame. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6031.54s)]
*  Vatican II, at that time, [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6033.58s)]
*  60, 70% of Catholics went to mass every Sunday, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6036.3s)]
*  like in 1960. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6039.06s)]
*  Now it's 19. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6040.46s)]
*  It's pathetic. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6042.38s)]
*  Go back to mass. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6043.780000000001s)]
*  The sex abuse thing played a big role in that, didn't it? [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6044.820000000001s)]
*  It did, but I wouldn't put so much on it [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6047.1s)]
*  because those numbers were really bad [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6049.62s)]
*  even before the sex abuse scandal. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6051.06s)]
*  We were down like 20% in the 1980s. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6053.02s)]
*  But that has had a deleterious effect on our whole culture, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6057.3s)]
*  I think. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6060.740000000001s)]
*  People absenting themselves from church. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6061.580000000001s)]
*  When I was a little kid, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6064.1s)]
*  it was 97% of Americans would have identified as religious. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6065.660000000001s)]
*  Well, you saw that. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6070.3s)]
*  Sunday was different. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6071.26s)]
*  When I was a kid, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6072.700000000001s)]
*  Sunday was an entirely different day of the week. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6073.54s)]
*  It felt different. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6075.26s)]
*  People went to church. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6076.1s)]
*  They stopped going to church. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6078.5s)]
*  And that is not good for the society. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6079.74s)]
*  Bishop Aaron, thank you very much for that conversation. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6083.9s)]
*  You're welcome. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6086.139999999999s)]
*  I loved it. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6086.98s)]
*  Me too. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6087.8s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6088.639999999999s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6095.62s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6097.179999999999s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6098.0199999999995s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6099.66s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6101.62s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6105.179999999999s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6108.18s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6111.18s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6112.58s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6114.56s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6115.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6117.4800000000005s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6118.900000000001s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6120.06s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6121.1s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6122.42s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6125.66s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6127.42s)]
*  we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6129.06s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6130.9800000000005s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6131.820000000001s)]
*  and share this video. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6135.06s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6136.34s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6138.54s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUedSE78Mo0&t=6141.46s)]
