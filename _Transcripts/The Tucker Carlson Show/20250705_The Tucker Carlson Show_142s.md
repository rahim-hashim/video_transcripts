# Why Weâ€™re Interviewing President of Iran Masoud Pezeshkian
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ)
*  We just finished up an interview with Massoud Peseshkian, who is the president of Iran, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  the 70 year old heart surgeon who leads the country we were just at war with about a week and a half ago. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=5.64s)]
*  We know we'll be criticized for doing this interview. Why did we do it anyway? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=11.96s)]
*  Well, we did it because we were just at war with Iran 10 days ago and maybe again. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=15.56s)]
*  And so our view, which has remained consistent over time, is that American citizens have [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=21.04s)]
*  the constitutional right and the God-given right to all the information they can gather about matters that affect them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=26.619999999999997s)]
*  If their country is doing something with their money in their name, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=34.22s)]
*  they have a right, an absolute right, to know as much about it as they can and that would include [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=37.08s)]
*  hearing from the people they're fighting. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=41.48s)]
*  Now, can you believe everything you hear from the president of Iran? Probably not. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=43.8s)]
*  But that's not the point. The point is you should be able to decide for yourself [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=49.099999999999994s)]
*  whether you believe it or not. And keep in mind that anyone who seeks to deny you that right is not your ally, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=52.62s)]
*  but your enemy. By the way, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=58.74s)]
*  we have also put in for the third time in the last several months an interview request with the prime minister of Israel, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=60.98s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu, and we hope he accepts that. The interview is limited by a couple of factors. One, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=66.9s)]
*  it was done by remote through a translator. That's always awkward. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=72.38s)]
*  For another, I don't speak Persian and there are all kinds of questions that I didn't ask the president of Iran, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=75.53999999999999s)]
*  particularly questions to which I knew I could not get an honest answer such as, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=81.64s)]
*  was your nuclear program totally disabled by the bombing campaign by the US government a week and a half ago? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=86.28s)]
*  There's no chance he's gonna answer that question honestly. I didn't bother to ask it. The answer, in fact, from an American perspective, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  even from the CIA's perspective, is unknowable. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=97.0s)]
*  So we dispensed with those and I asked him very simple questions such as, what is your goal? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=100.38s)]
*  Do you seek war with the United States? Do you seek war with Israel? Etc, etc, etc. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=105.6s)]
*  Again, the purpose of this was not to get to the absolute truth. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=109.58s)]
*  That's impossible in an interview like this. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=112.46s)]
*  The purpose of the interview was to add to the corpus of knowledge from which Americans can derive their own opinion. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=114.58s)]
*  Learn everything you can and then you decide. That's the promise of America. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=121.3s)]
*  And we hope that this interview does a small part to making that promise real. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  This interview will be up as soon as we have done editing it, as noted, and that should be in a day or two. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=131.14s)]
*  Thank you for watching! [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTO1yJIOBgQ&t=139.5s)]
