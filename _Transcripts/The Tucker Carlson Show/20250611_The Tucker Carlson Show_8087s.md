# Jeffrey Sachs: Ukraine/Russia Dangerous New Escalation, & the Dark Forces Pushing for War With Iran
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs)
*  Donald Trump ran as a peace candidate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=0.0s)]
*  He was going to end the Biden administration's disastrous war in Ukraine and he was going [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  to bring peace to the Middle East. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7.36s)]
*  And for the past seven months, he's been trying to do just that. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=9.4s)]
*  We're getting a lot closer, but we're not quite there. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=12.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=16.2s)]
*  Well, says Professor Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia, who has been watching carefully and speaking [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=17.2s)]
*  to many people involved, because the intel agencies aren't on board at all. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=21.34s)]
*  So, almost three years ago, you got bounced off of Morning Joe after many years, basically [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=30.0s)]
*  entire world that you occupied and had occupied for decades, simply for saying, hey, maybe [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=55.24s)]
*  the war in Ukraine is not a good idea. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=61.68s)]
*  So it's been a number of years since that happened. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=64.12s)]
*  And I wonder if you have thought about or answered the question, why is the Ukraine [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=66.08s)]
*  war so central to the people in charge of our society? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=72.76s)]
*  What is it about that that creates this very intense attachment? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=78.2s)]
*  Exile you for disagreeing over it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=84.12s)]
*  Well, let me start with the basic point. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=86.08s)]
*  The war is not a good idea, and it could have ended three years ago. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=90.08s)]
*  This is yet another of the tragedies of the Ukraine war. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  On April 15th, 2022, there was a draft agreement between Ukraine and Russia to end the war. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=102.68s)]
*  The United States swooped in, told the Ukrainians, don't do it, keep fighting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=112.78s)]
*  And three years on, Ukraine has lost perhaps more than a million young people to death [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=119.26s)]
*  and serious injury. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=129.46s)]
*  It has lost territory. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=131.7s)]
*  It has had the country destroyed. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=133.38s)]
*  It has had its economy brought to ruins. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=135.5s)]
*  The whole situation of the last three years has been any help whatsoever to Ukraine. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=138.6s)]
*  So when I said three years ago, I also said it five years ago and before even Russia's [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=146.04s)]
*  invasion in February 2022 that there didn't have to be a war, that the war could easily [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=153.95999999999998s)]
*  be avoided when I said in March and April of 2022, you could stop right now and end [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=161.94s)]
*  the war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=170.66s)]
*  Not only was that right, it was, if I could put it this way, pro-Ukraine. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=173.06s)]
*  Of course, it was attacked at the time as being anti-Ukraine. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=179.02s)]
*  This is the craziest thing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=182.52s)]
*  The friends of Ukraine, so-called, are the ones that are completely destroying Ukraine. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=184.14s)]
*  The friends of Ukraine, so-called, are the ones that tell Ukraine to fight on, to fight [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=191.88s)]
*  on. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=198.12s)]
*  It's like being, I guess, the coach in a boxing match and your guy is being bloodied and being [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=199.12s)]
*  hit and being destroyed in the battle and you say, go, I'm on your side, go out there [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=207.9s)]
*  and hit him again until they get smashed one more time and they're brought to their side [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=214.26s)]
*  of the ring and again you tell them, go out and fight because I'm your buddy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=221.54s)]
*  This is the disaster that the so-called friends of Ukraine, whether it is all that we saw [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=226.66s)]
*  during the Biden administration or that we hear every day from Stammer, the Prime Minister [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=233.14s)]
*  of UK or Mertz, the new Chancellor of Germany or Macron from France and of course from Zelensky, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=241.34s)]
*  who is now running, I'm sorry to put it this way, but a little dictatorship because he [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=249.98s)]
*  runs by martial law, he doesn't run by public support, but they're all the ones telling [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=257.42s)]
*  their young people, go out to the front lines, go get killed and this has been going on for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=262.02s)]
*  years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=266.5s)]
*  So the question you ask is why? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=267.5s)]
*  This isn't for Ukraine, this is destroying Ukraine. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=270.52s)]
*  So what is it for? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=274.28s)]
*  I think it's quite obvious and it's been obvious for many years. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=276.82s)]
*  The American push to Ukraine to fight on, don't accept neutrality and so forth, this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=282.73999999999995s)]
*  has been a project of the American deep state of the military industrial complex dating [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=292.14s)]
*  back decades and the target has nothing to do with Ukraine at all, it's destroying Ukraine. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=302.5s)]
*  The target is to quote weaken Russia, this is the point. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=308.64s)]
*  But why would you want to? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=312.46s)]
*  To weaken Russia? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=314.76s)]
*  That's an even longer story. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=316.7s)]
*  I mean no one wants to weaken India. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=318.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very good point and someday when India succeeds we will want to weaken India. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=320.66s)]
*  So that's basically. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=328.54s)]
*  Probably sooner rather than later. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=329.54s)]
*  That's actually quite interesting. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=331.06s)]
*  Maybe you'll make me digress right at the start. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=333.56s)]
*  In the early years of this century, in 2000, 2001, 2002, the US relationship with China [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=337.48s)]
*  was just kind of normal, but even keel we had good business with China. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=347.3s)]
*  One of my dear friends with whom I somewhat disagree on some things and agree vociferously [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=355.26s)]
*  on other things, John Mearsheimer, the great political scientist, wrote a famous book called [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=362.62s)]
*  The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=370.9s)]
*  This is his magnum opus and in it he says at the beginning of the book, in around 2000, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=373.78s)]
*  He said the relations with China are quiet now, but when China gains power, we will go [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=380.06s)]
*  into conflict with China. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=386.26000000000005s)]
*  And so this is to answer your question. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=388.46000000000004s)]
*  Why would John Mearsheimer say that? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=391.18s)]
*  Not because of anything China would have done, but because a big power will generate a reaction [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=393.54s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=402.18s)]
*  This is his theory that we're on an almost inevitable collision course, the great powers. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=403.82s)]
*  I'm not so pessimistic, although I'd say Mearsheimer is empirically more right in a way. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=411.22s)]
*  So he somewhat accurately describes things, but he also labeled his book The Tragedy of [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=416.90000000000003s)]
*  Great Power Politics. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=424.98s)]
*  And I don't want tragedy all the time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=425.98s)]
*  I'd like a little comedy, actually a little normal relations. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=428.18s)]
*  So to answer your question, what do we have against Russia? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=432.9s)]
*  The fact of the matter is Russia is big. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=438.21999999999997s)]
*  Russia is powerful. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=442.98s)]
*  And for that reason and that reason alone or sufficiently, the US would oppose Russia, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=446.38s)]
*  just like the US opposes China. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=455.3s)]
*  Now of course, maybe people listening to this or say, that's crazy. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=458.06s)]
*  We oppose China because of all the terrible things they do, or we oppose Russia because [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  of all of the terrible things they do. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=465.42s)]
*  I would take a different view of this, which is we make up stories about why we oppose [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=468.06s)]
*  big powers. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=476.66s)]
*  But the basic reason we oppose big powers is that they are big. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=478.34000000000003s)]
*  They are an affront to our desire for what the political scientists in a fancy word call [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=482.26s)]
*  primacy, or call hegemony, or call full spectrum dominance. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=490.3s)]
*  In other words, Russia is an affront to our ability to dictate circumstances. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=496.22s)]
*  China certainly is an affront to the US ability to dictate circumstances in Asia. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=503.5s)]
*  For that reason alone, we, for me, it's fine. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=510.54s)]
*  I understand there are many powers in the world. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  That's how the world is. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=518.86s)]
*  But for the powers that be in Washington, that's completely antithetical to the American [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=520.0600000000001s)]
*  strategic purpose, which explicitly for many, many years has been full spectrum dominance [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=529.7s)]
*  or primacy. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=539.46s)]
*  In other words, our purpose stated by the establishment, by the military industrial [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=540.82s)]
*  complex is we must be the unrivaled number one. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=547.42s)]
*  So if you ask why do we hate Russia, because Russia stands in the way of us being the unrivaled [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=552.78s)]
*  number one. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=561.62s)]
*  Now you could say, well, it's because of all the terrible things that they do. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=563.62s)]
*  But it's a little more complicated than that. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=568.8199999999999s)]
*  During the Cold War from 1945 to 1991, we hated Russia because it was communist. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=571.22s)]
*  I happened to be quite deeply involved at the end of that period as an economic advisor [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=584.1s)]
*  when they were trying to get out of that horrible system. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=591.14s)]
*  I advised President Gorbachev in 1990-91 and I advised President Yeltsin in 1992-93. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=594.74s)]
*  Yeltsin said, we don't want any of this communism anymore. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=604.74s)]
*  We want to be a normal country. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=608.82s)]
*  So the United States came up with other reasons to hate Russia. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=610.82s)]
*  So I watched with my own eyes that the reason that had been given was not the real reason. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=614.9s)]
*  It was maybe the believed reason, but it was the narrative reason. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=622.02s)]
*  We hate Russia because it is a godless communist country. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=626.82s)]
*  Now it is a Russian orthodox non-communist country and we still hate Russia. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=631.86s)]
*  Same deal. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=638.7s)]
*  And by the way, what's absolutely fascinating is if you go back to a hundred eighty years [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=640.1s)]
*  ago, and I'm not kidding, to 1840, our precursor as world hegemon, that was the British Empire, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=649.14s)]
*  they hated Russia too. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=658.58s)]
*  And why? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=661.54s)]
*  For no reason. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=663.86s)]
*  It was a little bit before the Bolshevik Revolution, by the way. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=664.8199999999999s)]
*  It was before any ostensible reason, but the British elite hated Russia. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=667.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=676.9s)]
*  And it shows an interesting answer to your question. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=678.74s)]
*  A historian named Gleason in 1950 tried to answer the question, how did Britain come to hate Russia? [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=684.58s)]
*  Why is it that by 1840 the British hated the Russians so much that 13 years later, in 1853, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=695.46s)]
*  the British went to war against Russia, a war of choice in the Crimean War? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=705.06s)]
*  So this historian did an amazing job because it was before AI and being able to ask all these good [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=712.02s)]
*  questions. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=720.0999999999999s)]
*  He went through all the archives. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  He went through all the speeches by British leaders, all the speeches in the House of Commons, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=723.54s)]
*  all the articles written in the intellectual magazines from 1850 onward. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=730.5s)]
*  And he posed the question, he said, we were allies of Russia in 1815 in defeating Napoleon. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=737.62s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=744.26s)]
*  We were allies. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=744.9s)]
*  Then, just 25 years later, we're enemies. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=746.9s)]
*  What happened? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=753.06s)]
*  So he goes through all of the speeches, everything. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=754.42s)]
*  His conclusion in the end is remarkable. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=758.5s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=762.1s)]
*  There was no reason why Britain came to hate Russia, except Russia was big [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=763.62s)]
*  and therefore was an affront to the British Empire. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=771.94s)]
*  And of course, the British concocted an idea, which was a completely bizarre idea. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=775.94s)]
*  And that was that the Tsar was going to invade British India through the Khyber Pass. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=782.4200000000001s)]
*  This became known as the Great Game afterwards. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=789.46s)]
*  This was a crazy idea. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=794.6600000000001s)]
*  The thought never even crossed the minds of these Tsars. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=796.1s)]
*  To march across Afghanistan? [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=800.34s)]
*  To march across Afghanistan and into India, into the Indian subcontinent to fight the British [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=802.0200000000001s)]
*  empires and loony tunes. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=809.3s)]
*  But the British elite came to view Russia as the great threat to the British Empire, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=811.6999999999999s)]
*  the threat to India, the crown jewel of the empire. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=820.3399999999999s)]
*  So much so that by 1840, Britain was rabidly Russophobic. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=825.06s)]
*  And then by 1853, Lord Palmerston totally concocted a pretext to go to war with Russia, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=831.38s)]
*  the Crimean War. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=843.38s)]
*  Charge of the Light Brigade. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=844.5s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, Charge of the Light Brigade. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=845.94s)]
*  And the Crimean War was a concocted showdown between the British Empire and the Russian Empire. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=848.02s)]
*  Concocted because the Russians said, we don't want to fight you. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=857.06s)]
*  You know, they had challenged, the Russians had challenged the Ottoman Turks and put some [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=860.74s)]
*  troops in Wallachia at the mouth of the Danube. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=868.74s)]
*  And because the Ottomans had given some privileges to France that the Russians thought belonged to [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=873.78s)]
*  them. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=881.3s)]
*  And then the British and the French threatened the Russians and the Russians retreated. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=882.02s)]
*  This is the prelude to the Crimean War. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=886.74s)]
*  The Russians retreated. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=890.02s)]
*  And then when the Russians retreated, the British said, we now fight on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=891.86s)]
*  In other words, the pretext was gone, but they wanted that war. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=897.54s)]
*  Why did they want the war? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=902.1s)]
*  They wanted the war because the British idea was to banish Russia from the Black Sea region. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=903.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=911.86s)]
*  Remember, the Black Sea is Russia's warm water port till today, by the way. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=913.3s)]
*  It was created as a warm water port in 1783 by the Empress Catherine the Great. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=919.86s)]
*  And it has been Russia's warm water port since then. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=929.38s)]
*  Crimea. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=933.0600000000001s)]
*  Palmerston in Crimea. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=933.78s)]
*  In Sevastopol, precisely, which was besieged by the British and the French during the Crimean War. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=935.86s)]
*  The Russians eventually surrendered. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=943.78s)]
*  And in the Treaty of Paris in 1856, the Russians agreed to scrap their Black Sea fleet. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=949.38s)]
*  It remained scrapped for about 20 years, actually. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=957.2199999999999s)]
*  And then as history always shows, the French went running back to the Russians, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=961.3s)]
*  ally with us because the Germans are rising in power. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=969.54s)]
*  And so suddenly the enemy became the friend because you needed a new friend to fight the [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=972.9000000000001s)]
*  new enemy and so on. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=979.86s)]
*  It's kind of crazy European politics. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=981.1400000000001s)]
*  But the idea of Lord Palmerston was banish Russia from the Black Sea and you reduce Russia to a [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=984.0200000000001s)]
*  third-rate power. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=993.94s)]
*  Now, all of this is fascinating because, first of all, the Russophobia was a concocted hatred. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=996.02s)]
*  Second, the war between Britain and France on one side and Russia in 1853 was concocted. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1005.06s)]
*  But third, we're replaying that almost to the same script today and almost with exactly the same [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1013.62s)]
*  plot line, which is so weird but true. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1025.22s)]
*  And why I say that is the United States, quote, or the inside deep state, the CIA and its apparatus [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1029.22s)]
*  and the rest of the military industrial complexes hated the Soviet Union since 1945, even though [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1041.38s)]
*  they were our ally in defeating Hitler. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1049.62s)]
*  It turned to preparing for war against our ally within a few months of the end of World War II. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1052.9799999999998s)]
*  This is by itself a very important point. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1060.6599999999999s)]
*  And then from 1945 to 1991, we had the Cold War ostensibly against communism and against [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1064.1s)]
*  international communism. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1073.6999999999998s)]
*  Then in December 1991, the Soviet Union ended. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1075.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't know if I've mentioned it to you before, I was in the Kremlin that day, literally that hour [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1082.5800000000002s)]
*  sitting next in front of Boris Yeltsin or I was in front of him. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1089.5400000000002s)]
*  And he said to me and to my colleagues, gentlemen, I want to tell you the Soviet Union is over. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1094.8200000000002s)]
*  I heard it probably first in the world directly from President Yeltsin in December 1991. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1104.02s)]
*  So here's a company we're always excited to advertise because we actually use their products [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1113.22s)]
*  every day at Maryweather Farms. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1117.94s)]
*  Remember when everybody knew their neighborhood butcher, you look back and you feel like, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1119.22s)]
*  oh, there was something really important about that knowing the person who cut your meat. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1123.3s)]
*  And at some point your grandparents knew the people who raised their meat so they could trust [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1128.26s)]
*  what they ate. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1132.98s)]
*  But that time is long gone. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1134.5s)]
*  It's been replaced by an era of grocery store mystery meat boxed by distant beef corporations, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1135.6200000000001s)]
*  none of which raised a single cow. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1142.5s)]
*  Unlike your childhood, they don't know you. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1144.18s)]
*  They're not interested in you. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1147.06s)]
*  The whole thing is creepy. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1148.34s)]
*  The only thing that matters to them is money and God knows what you're eating. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1149.94s)]
*  Maryweather Farms is the answer to that. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1153.06s)]
*  They raise their cattle in the US, in Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado, and they prepare their [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1154.9s)]
*  meat themselves in their facilities in this country. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1159.86s)]

*  And Yeltsin said at the time, I want us to be a normal country. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1194.74s)]
*  We want a normal economy, Mr. Sachs. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1200.82s)]

*  And I, in my naivety, said to him, President Yeltsin, I can assure you, the American people [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1209.86s)]
*  will want to partner with Russia to have a future of peace and economic cooperation. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1219.46s)]
*  And I was completely convinced of it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1228.8999999999999s)]
*  I thought this is the most historic moment imaginable. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1231.3s)]
*  I was pinching myself, can you believe you're sitting in the Kremlin hearing [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1234.34s)]
*  from the president of Russia, the end of the Soviet Union. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1239.3s)]
*  And I had that blessing. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1242.98s)]
*  It was unbelievable. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1245.54s)]
*  I was wrong. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1248.26s)]
*  Because as soon as the Soviet Union ended, what did the deep state say? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1249.78s)]
*  Well, they said, this is great. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1257.3s)]
*  Now we need to dismember Russia too. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1259.86s)]
*  Just like the Soviet Union broke apart on its ethnic lines, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1263.1399999999999s)]
*  Russia is fragile. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1267.78s)]
*  Maybe, as Big Brzezinski opined, maybe it'll be three different parts. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1269.7s)]
*  Maybe there'll be a European part, a Siberian part, and a Far East part. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1276.1s)]
*  The arrogance, the hubris is unbelievable on the American side. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1281.3s)]
*  But the idea was, Cold War over? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1287.46s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1291.62s)]
*  Now we go on to surround Russia. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1292.8999999999999s)]
*  Now we go on to chip apart Russia. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1296.1799999999998s)]
*  One of the favorite phrases in Washington used to be to decolonize Russia. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1298.98s)]
*  It meant that we can break away different regions of Russia, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1306.74s)]
*  Chechnya, or this region, or that region. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1311.86s)]
*  Why? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1314.74s)]
*  It's a big power. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1315.2199999999998s)]
*  We're the only big power that should be on the planet. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1316.6599999999999s)]
*  And incidentally, in 1992, I can absolutely assure you, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1319.9399999999998s)]
*  no one had China on the radar screen in Washington at all. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1325.78s)]
*  China was rice-growing villages, maybe a counterpoint to help weaken Russia, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1330.8999999999999s)]
*  or as it was used in this triangulation to weaken the Soviet Union. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1339.22s)]
*  But it wasn't on anybody's radar screen as potentially a competitor or a threat or anything else. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1346.5s)]
*  So the focus was on Russia, and it remained on Russia. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1353.46s)]
*  And we know that the US deep state, and again, by that, I don't mean [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1356.9s)]
*  just a figment of our imagination or a metaphor. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1364.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean the CIA. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1367.7s)]
*  I mean the rest of the intelligence agencies. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1370.0200000000002s)]
*  I mean the Pentagon. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1373.94s)]
*  I mean the Armed Services Committees of the Congress. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1375.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean the military contractors. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1379.0600000000002s)]
*  They already, by 1992, had the idea of unchallenged primacy of the United States. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1381.54s)]
*  And this became called neoconservatism afterwards. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1392.02s)]
*  But it was early on. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1395.86s)]
*  And of course, Cheney was our defense secretary in 1992, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1397.46s)]
*  and Wolfowitz was his deputy. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1402.5s)]
*  And all of the familiar figures that we came to know in the Iraq War and afterwards [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1404.5s)]
*  were on the scene. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1412.66s)]
*  This was the end of Bush Senior. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1414.5s)]
*  And they already concocted the idea of US unipolarity or primacy or full spectrum dominance [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1416.98s)]
*  or hegemony, whatever term one wants to use. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1427.8600000000001s)]
*  Then comes Clinton into office. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1431.46s)]
*  And Clinton's a kind of inconsequential inexperience. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1435.06s)]
*  I think just not a serious person and didn't become one, unfortunately, during his presidency. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1446.74s)]
*  And the deep state explains to him, this is the way it is. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1455.3s)]
*  And he also hears from Central Europe countries that I was advising, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1460.0200000000002s)]
*  but not advising on this for sure, oh, we need NATO. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1466.66s)]
*  Why do you need NATO? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1472.66s)]
*  NATO was supposed to protect you against the Soviet Union. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1474.0200000000002s)]
*  The Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1478.1000000000001s)]
*  Russia is not threatening anybody. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1481.14s)]
*  It's barely surviving the financial crisis. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1483.6200000000001s)]
*  But it doesn't have its eyes on Prague or on Warsaw or on Budapest, nothing of the sort. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1487.46s)]
*  But the idea of unipolarity is, we need to put our bases on every part of the board. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1493.94s)]
*  This is the game of risk. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1502.82s)]
*  We need to put our pieces everywhere. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1504.3400000000001s)]
*  And so the idea of NATO enlargement is worked out in 1993. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1507.14s)]
*  And there's bureaucratic opposition inside by smart diplomats who say, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1512.9s)]
*  why are we doing this? [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1517.54s)]
*  The Cold War is over. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1518.42s)]
*  But to the deep state, the Cold War was not over. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1519.94s)]
*  It was just revving up because we got to get rid of Russia in its current form as well. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1523.78s)]
*  So by the beginning of 1994, President Clinton, already in a speech in January 1994, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1530.02s)]
*  endorses the eastward expansion of NATO. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1538.66s)]
*  And if I could just put a parenthesis around that, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1542.74s)]
*  the US had promised unequivocally to the Soviet Union in the context of German reunification [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1546.3400000000001s)]
*  as of February 2000, February, sorry, 1990. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1555.38s)]
*  1990, excuse me, yes. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1565.14s)]
*  That NATO would not move one inch eastward. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1568.66s)]
*  This remains, by the way, highly contested to this day. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1572.42s)]
*  But if anyone wants the information, you go on something called the National Security [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1576.8200000000002s)]
*  Archive of George Washington University. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1582.8200000000002s)]
*  And you can read the dozens and dozens of statements and all of the archival material, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1586.18s)]
*  making completely, absolutely, unequivocally clear that the United States and Germany [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1592.82s)]
*  promised that NATO would not move one inch eastward. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1601.3799999999999s)]
*  So the record is absolutely clear. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1606.02s)]
*  But Clinton, being Clinton in the way that he governed, was told by the deep state, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1608.74s)]
*  now we start moving eastward. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1614.42s)]
*  And Clinton thought that was good domestic politics also, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1617.06s)]
*  with the Polish-American vote, Czech-American vote, and so forth. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1620.8200000000002s)]
*  And he was also told by friends like Vaclav Havel in Czech Republic and so forth, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1625.22s)]
*  this is a good idea. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1632.26s)]
*  So he starts the NATO enlargement eastward. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1633.3000000000002s)]
*  And in 1997, Zbigniew Brzezinski explains basically the Lord Palmerston strategy. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1637.0600000000002s)]
*  We will surround Russia in the Black Sea region, and we will render Russia a third-rate power. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1648.1000000000001s)]
*  And why not? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1658.82s)]
*  It's so low cost. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1659.7s)]
*  We're so powerful. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1660.98s)]
*  What could stop us? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1662.3400000000001s)]
*  We're unchallenged anyway. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1663.46s)]
*  They're weak. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1664.98s)]
*  They depend on us. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1665.78s)]
*  So there was no... [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1667.54s)]
*  It wasn't even heatedly debated. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1669.54s)]
*  But Brzezinski's absolutely clear about this. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1672.5s)]
*  And like so many learned volumes, I must say, his book, The Grand Chessboard, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1677.1399999999999s)]
*  is very well written and fundamentally wrong. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1683.62s)]
*  And fundamentally wrong in that he has a whole essentially long chapter saying, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1687.78s)]
*  NATO will move eastward, Europe, meaning the European Union, will move eastward, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1696.34s)]
*  and what will Russia be able to do about it? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1702.26s)]
*  And he goes into a long analysis saying, could Russia turn to China? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1705.62s)]
*  No, never. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1711.06s)]
*  Could Russia turn to Iran? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1712.82s)]
*  No, never. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1715.06s)]
*  Russia's only vocation is the European vocation. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1716.82s)]
*  So Russia's going to have to swallow hard and accept this. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1721.6999999999998s)]
*  The point, Tucker, is what we're witnessing is not short-term decisions of presidents. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1726.58s)]
*  We're watching a long-term, consistent strategy, of course, built into the mindsets [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1737.3s)]
*  of senators and congressmen and more than the mindsets built into their campaign contributions as well. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1746.34s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1753.7s)]
*  So this is built into the Armed Services Committee. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1754.9s)]
*  This is built into the Intelligence Committee. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1758.34s)]
*  This is why Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal stand up every day [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1763.54s)]
*  saying we must fight the Russians and so on. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1768.58s)]
*  This is not short-term claims based on current politics. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1771.3s)]
*  This is a project that dates back more than 30 years. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1779.06s)]
*  It's a stupid project. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1784.98s)]
*  Well, the verdict is in, though. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1786.5s)]
*  So, I mean, ultimately, the project reaches its inevitable conclusion, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1788.34s)]
*  which is including Russia's largest and most important neighbor, Ukraine, in NATO. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1793.46s)]
*  They announced that in February at the Munich Security Conference of 2022, [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1799.3s)]
*  and then almost immediately after Russia rolls across into Ukraine, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1802.6599999999999s)]
*  and then the war commences and it's a disaster for everybody, especially the United States, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1807.06s)]
*  I would argue. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1811.3s)]
*  And it does what Brzezinski said it wouldn't do, which is drive Russia right into China [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1812.26s)]
*  into what's now a permanent alliance. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1815.54s)]
*  So it's a disaster. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1817.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1818.26s)]
*  So you get home from work on a Friday night, you're psyched because you've finished the entire week [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1819.1399999999999s)]
*  of work, it's time to reward yourself. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1822.98s)]
*  So you go to the snack cabinet and 10 minutes later, you've consumed an entire bag of chips, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1825.62s)]
*  your typical American chip brand, and you feel like garbage. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1832.34s)]
*  Of course you do. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1836.98s)]
*  You just stuffed hundreds of calories of chemically-laced, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1838.1799999999998s)]
*  seed-oil-infused crap into your mouth. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1841.3s)]
*  This is not a good way to start the weekend. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1844.02s)]
*  And who hasn't done it? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1846.4199999999998s)]
*  Cast the first stone. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1848.5s)]
*  But there is a better way. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1850.02s)]

*  Let me just say in terms of chronology, one more piece to add, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1914.42s)]
*  just to add to the historical note, the decision to invite Ukraine and even more crazy, by the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1918.58s)]
*  way, the country of Georgia, which is in the South Caucasus, people should take out a map [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1928.74s)]
*  and look at this region between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and ask themselves a question. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1934.4199999999998s)]
*  Is that the North Atlantic? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1940.34s)]
*  Because NATO is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1942.6599999999999s)]
*  Or is that the soft underbelly of Russia in the Caucasus mountains? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1947.14s)]
*  This is insane. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1953.7800000000002s)]
*  It's more Asian than European in some ways. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1955.3000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's literally Asia because the European demarcation is the crest line of the Grand Caucasus. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1958.5s)]
*  So we're inviting an Asian country, Georgia, into NATO. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1967.3000000000002s)]
*  Stalin's home nation. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1973.14s)]
*  And fascinating. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1975.38s)]
*  Why Georgia? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1977.38s)]
*  Because look at the map also. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1979.22s)]
*  Not only is it Asia, not only is it not the North Atlantic, but it completes the encirclement of [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1981.5400000000002s)]
*  Russia in the Black Sea. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1988.2600000000002s)]
*  So it's not a random choice. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1990.1000000000001s)]
*  It's Palmerston, 1853, brought to life by Brzezinski, 1997, and lived out by George Bush Jr. in 2008. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=1992.1000000000001s)]
*  They announced this. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2005.5400000000002s)]
*  Putin says, no, this is not going to be. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2007.5400000000002s)]
*  This is craziness. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2011.38s)]
*  In the meantime, also remember that in this incredible hubris of the United States, this mad arrogance, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2013.5400000000002s)]
*  in 2002, the US unilaterally walked out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2023.3000000000002s)]
*  So the US destabilized the nuclear arms control framework fundamentally in 2002. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2030.5s)]
*  This is not sufficiently appreciated because from Russia's point of view until today and literally [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2040.1s)]
*  on a strike on strategic bombers last week, Russia believes that the United States has killed [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2047.7s)]
*  the nuclear arms framework. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2055.54s)]
*  So we're talking about not vague national security concerns. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2057.54s)]
*  We're talking about fundamental national and world survival terms. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2062.02s)]
*  Because from Russia's point of view and understandably so, the United States doesn't want to play by any [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2068.42s)]
*  single rules whatsoever. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2075.06s)]
*  So I just want to say that this project Ukraine not only goes back to the 1990s, but the invitation [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2077.46s)]
*  was in 2008, the Russians said no. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2084.9s)]
*  So in 2010, a pro-neutral president, Viktor Yanukovych, is elected. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2088.42s)]
*  He comes to power on the basis of no NATO enlargement because he knows how dangerous that is for [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2094.82s)]
*  his country being between East and West. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2100.98s)]
*  He says, stay away to both sides and we will keep calm. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2103.7000000000003s)]
*  In February 2014, the United States conspires in a coup that overthrows Yanukovych. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2108.98s)]
*  And that was a coup in which the US was deeply engaged. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2118.2599999999998s)]
*  My colleague at Columbia University, my colleague now, Victoria Nuland, was the point person on [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2123.3s)]
*  the ground. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2128.98s)]
*  Jeffrey Piot, who was a senior official for Biden back in 2014. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2131.78s)]
*  He was ambassador, in fact, to Ukraine and then became a senior State Department official [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2137.54s)]
*  in the Biden administration afterwards. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2142.82s)]
*  Senators Lindsey Graham, he was out there. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2146.66s)]
*  John McCain. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2150.58s)]
*  This was a typical US regime change operation. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2152.02s)]
*  What do I mean by that? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2156.82s)]
*  It means Yanukovych is in the way of our plan. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2158.42s)]
*  We need to get him out of the way because we need to expand NATO. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2163.62s)]
*  And so Yanukovych is overthrown on February 22nd, 2014, violently within a nanosecond. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2169.8599999999997s)]
*  Rather than saying, hey, the president should come back, a violent group overtook the government [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2178.3399999999997s)]
*  buildings. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2183.94s)]
*  President Obama recognizes the new government within a nanosecond because this is a US game. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2186.34s)]
*  This is the whole point. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2195.2200000000003s)]
*  If you were a serious country that believed in democracy, President Obama would have said, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2197.1800000000003s)]
*  we don't accept mobs entering our buildings and overthrowing our government. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2203.5s)]
*  Yanukovych is the elected president and he is the one we recognize. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2212.26s)]
*  No, within a nanosecond, Obama recognized the new post-coup regime, the one that Zelensky [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2216.98s)]
*  leads today. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2224.94s)]
*  And amazingly, according to script, honest to God, one of the first things that this [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2227.1800000000003s)]
*  new regime, this regime brought to power by an American participation in a coup. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2235.26s)]
*  Not only Americans, there were Ukrainian right-wing forces also, but America played its active [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2243.7400000000002s)]
*  role. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2249.82s)]
*  What is one of the first things they say? [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2251.1000000000004s)]
*  They say, we think Russia should exit from Crimea. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2253.1800000000003s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2258.1400000000003s)]
*  We think the Russian military base needs to leave Crimea. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2259.5800000000004s)]
*  Now it's interesting, under Yanukovych's term, Yanukovych and Putin negotiated not a territorial [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2264.94s)]
*  annexation of Crimea, but rather a 25-year lease. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2273.66s)]
*  Thank you very much that Russia will keep its naval base in Crimean Sevastopol. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2278.86s)]
*  But immediately the post-coup regime reads the script and says, we don't think Russia [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2284.94s)]
*  should be in Crimea. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2290.54s)]
*  In other words, subscript, NATO is going to take over the military base in the Black [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2292.86s)]
*  Sea. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2299.82s)]
*  That's when Russia immediately organizes a referendum and Crimea is taken into Russian [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2300.82s)]
*  hands. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2308.6200000000003s)]
*  This wasn't an innocent event. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2309.6200000000003s)]
*  This was part of the playbook of the United States. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2312.1s)]
*  The war started in February 2014. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2315.92s)]
*  It didn't start with the invasion by Russia in February 2022. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2320.24s)]
*  That was a major escalation, but the war started in February 2014. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2325.3199999999997s)]
*  It escalated. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2331.5s)]
*  The U.S. built up the Ukrainian military to be the largest standing army of Europe, in [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2333.5s)]
*  fact, by 2021. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2340.24s)]
*  When Biden came into office, Putin tried one more time, would you commit or we call on [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2344.44s)]
*  you to commit to not enlarge NATO to Ukraine? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2353.4s)]
*  And we've talked about it. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2359.12s)]
*  I begged Jake Sullivan in a phone call in December 2021, Jake, take the agreement. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2361.3s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2369.58s)]
*  Avoid the war. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2370.58s)]
*  No, no. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2371.58s)]
*  We can't do that. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2373.36s)]
*  NATO opened door, so-called. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2375.1200000000003s)]
*  In other words, we're determined to move NATO into Ukraine. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2379.36s)]
*  And Jeff, don't worry, there won't be a war. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2384.04s)]
*  Another brilliant utterance of Professor Jake Sullivan. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2386.6200000000003s)]
*  You got everything wrong from beginning to end, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2391.1600000000003s)]
*  So then Russia invaded on February 24th, 2022. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2397.28s)]
*  And what was the point of that invasion? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2405.04s)]
*  In our hopeless mainstream media, which is again, New York Times, I'll use as a reference [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2410.02s)]
*  point phony from morning till night, it was to take over Ukraine. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2418.36s)]
*  No, it was not to take over Ukraine. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2422.76s)]
*  It was to push Ukraine to accept neutrality. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2425.12s)]
*  This was the point of the invasion. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2430.2999999999997s)]
*  And it was absolutely clear because within seven days, Zelensky said, OK, OK, OK, OK, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2433.14s)]
*  we can be neutral. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2440.0s)]
*  And within a couple of weeks, the Ukrainians had submitted a paper to the Russians to say, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2441.96s)]
*  why don't we just have neutrality? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2448.7599999999998s)]
*  And the Russians took that paper to President Putin. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2452.68s)]
*  And Putin said, OK, look, let's negotiate and we can find a resolution of this. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2456.68s)]
*  And that's when the so-called Istanbul process began. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2464.68s)]
*  The Turkish government said we will be a mediator. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2468.56s)]
*  I went and talked at length to the Turkish negotiators to understand all the details [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2473.06s)]
*  about this. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2478.3199999999997s)]
*  But the fact of the matter is in March 2022, as I was saying earlier, there were very [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2479.52s)]
*  rapid advances of a peace agreement. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2487.68s)]
*  By March 28, 2022, there was actually a joint communique between Russia and Ukraine saying [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2490.82s)]
*  we have reached a framework for peace. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2499.7599999999998s)]
*  This is forgotten completely today. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2503.44s)]
*  Then just two weeks later, specifically April 15, there was a draft agreement on the table. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2506.16s)]
*  Not everything was agreed. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2513.12s)]
*  There were some important points. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2514.2599999999998s)]
*  But basically, there was an agreement and serious negotiators would have completed the [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2516.3399999999997s)]
*  work. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2521.3599999999997s)]
*  That's when the United States told the Ukrainians, no, no, you fight on. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2522.3599999999997s)]
*  Now, this comes to your question. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2527.04s)]
*  Why did the US say that then? [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2529.92s)]
*  And why does the war continue now, even though clearly President Trump wants this war to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2532.8s)]
*  end? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2540.32s)]
*  Well, it continued then because it was undoubtedly the deep state idea. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2541.32s)]
*  And I spoke to US government officials. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2547.86s)]
*  A few of them still spoke to me at the time. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2550.88s)]
*  I knew senior officials. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2553.36s)]
*  They absolutely believed that the economic sanctions would bring Russia to its knees, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2555.84s)]
*  for example. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2562.92s)]
*  There was once upon a time that cutting Russia out from Swift was called the nuclear option. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2564.4s)]
*  Kind of a mind boggling ignorance and delusion that America runs everything. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2571.44s)]
*  So if we put sanctions on Russia, that will crush the Russian economy. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2577.52s)]
*  They didn't factor in the fact that Russia happens to sell commodities that are easily [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2586.28s)]
*  fungible and that are not so hard to direct to India, by the way, which then can resell [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2594.2200000000003s)]
*  to Europe. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2600.44s)]
*  So it's a little bit more costly. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2601.6400000000003s)]
*  It's stupid. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2603.84s)]
*  It's scratching your left ear with your right arm. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2605.2200000000003s)]
*  It's not the most direct way to do things. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2608.1200000000003s)]
*  We make everything more expensive, less efficient, but Europe still buys all this stuff. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2610.48s)]
*  The Indians are middlemen. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2617.04s)]
*  Of course, they buy a lot of oil for their own refining. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2620.56s)]
*  China buys gas and oil and so forth. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2624.08s)]
*  So Russia isn't brought to its knees, but they believed it then. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2626.2s)]
*  Okay, fast. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2629.04s)]
*  Well, not only is Russia not brought to its knees, would you rather have the Russian economy [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2630.04s)]
*  or the American economy right now? [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2633.72s)]
*  That's an interesting question. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2637.68s)]
*  Let me come to that in a moment because I want to address the question why this persists. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2639.96s)]
*  Okay? [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2648.08s)]
*  So they really believed that there would be victory in short order. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2649.08s)]
*  And if it wasn't the nuclear option, God, I hate the term because we're close to nuclear [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2655.88s)]
*  war, but if it weren't the nuclear option, so-called, of cutting Russia out of the swift [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2661.52s)]
*  banking system, it would be the Heimars. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2665.76s)]
*  It would be the Atacams. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2668.44s)]
*  Or it was the idea that Putin will never mobilize because that would be so unpopular, it would [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2670.32s)]
*  bring him down. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2677.0400000000004s)]
*  Or it was the idea that there would be an internal coup, pre-Goshen, or some other concocted [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2678.6800000000003s)]
*  event, and so on. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2684.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2687.76s)]
*  This was delusion morning till night, very typical of American foreign policy. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2688.76s)]
*  Then comes President Trump. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2695.6s)]
*  President Trump understands clearly this is really screwed up. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2699.24s)]
*  This is not helping Ukraine. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2705.44s)]
*  Ukraine cannot win on the battlefield. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2708.2s)]
*  More war means more deaths by the hundreds of thousands, more, not less, loss of territory. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2711.2999999999997s)]
*  And the whole idea, what are we fighting over? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2719.52s)]
*  This NATO enlargement, eh, I'm not interested. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2724.18s)]
*  This is President Trump's very accurate view of the situation. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2727.96s)]
*  And I think he gets it. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2732.78s)]
*  This is a stupid war. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2735.16s)]
*  This is an unnecessary war. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2736.52s)]
*  This is a costly war. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2738.38s)]
*  This diverts American attention. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2739.68s)]
*  This costs tens or hundreds of billions of dollars, depending on how long this goes on. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2741.8s)]
*  And so he says the war should end. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2749.36s)]
*  Completely right. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2752.08s)]
*  And he enunciates an absolutely basic point, clearly, which is NATO should not expand. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2753.94s)]
*  This is stupid. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2764.56s)]
*  This is the cause of this whole thing. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  That is the basis for ending this war. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2770.6600000000003s)]
*  We're not far from it. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2773.36s)]
*  Here's the sad fact. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2775.96s)]
*  Waging peace actually is as complicated as waging war. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2779.56s)]
*  And that is a paradox. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2785.36s)]
*  It seems not right. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2787.6200000000003s)]
*  Why doesn't peace just come when you say you don't want to fight? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2789.48s)]
*  And the reason is that the forces that want war are really powerful. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2793.54s)]
*  They don't just stop. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2801.32s)]
*  They don't stop because the president opines that the war should end. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2803.88s)]
*  The war has a lot of supporters. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2808.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2811.56s)]
*  Because from the American point of view, the project continues. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2812.82s)]
*  We can defeat Russia. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2817.48s)]
*  And why not have more war? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2819.36s)]
*  The war is good on many, many counts. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2820.96s)]
*  It weakens Russia. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2823.6800000000003s)]
*  We get to test our weapons systems. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2825.2400000000002s)]
*  As I can't even stand it, but as many of our senators from Blumenthal and Romney and [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2828.68s)]
*  others have vulgarly said, this is great. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2835.96s)]
*  No Americans are dying. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2839.64s)]
*  As if more than a million Ukrainian casualties means nothing. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2842.16s)]
*  And according to our politicians, to them, to American politicians, it means absolutely [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2847.8799999999997s)]
*  nothing. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2854.68s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2855.68s)]
*  You never hear them talk about their bravery. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2858.08s)]
*  You don't hear them talk about the kinds of emails that I receive, including one that [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2861.04s)]
*  I just received from somebody who said, Mr. Sacks, they're about to send me off to die. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2867.2799999999997s)]
*  Someone from Ukraine who just found my email publicly and he said, I'm 48 years old and [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2872.7599999999998s)]
*  they're sending me to the front lines. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2877.4s)]
*  So I'm sending a message that I know I'm about to die. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2879.96s)]
*  And it's true. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2885.48s)]
*  They send these middle-aged people, disabled people, kids grabbed off the streets, delivery [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2886.56s)]
*  boys off of bicycles, grabbed by these so-called recruiters who are thugs who pull them into [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2893.6s)]
*  vans and then they're sent off to the front lines and they're dying under the drones. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2901.2799999999997s)]
*  So for the American deep state, they don't care. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2907.84s)]
*  They don't count that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2913.1s)]
*  The war is okay. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2915.04s)]
*  Then in Europe, we've brought in a, the CIA has of course created a European wide security [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2918.04s)]
*  system largely out of view, but whatever the CIA does here, think of the MI6 in Britain [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2929.96s)]
*  operating in the same way. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2939.24s)]
*  And more disastrously think of BND in Germany, actually, which if you go back to 1945, not [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2942.32s)]
*  to go into too many details, has its Nazi roots. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2951.0800000000004s)]
*  But the CIA created it after 1945 with the former Nazi intelligence agents to fight against [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2954.1200000000003s)]
*  the Soviet Union, taking them straight out of Hitler's intelligence into US intelligence [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2962.98s)]
*  Back in 1945, so-called Galen operation. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2970.32s)]
*  Anyway, we have this whole network and this network is still going. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2973.92s)]
*  So the reason you have to wage peace is the president, he's just the president after all. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2979.96s)]
*  He faces throughout the US government, he faces the Lindsey Grahams and the Richard [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2989.36s)]
*  Blumenthal's, he faces the CIA operations. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=2996.52s)]
*  He faces these pathetic politicians. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3001.76s)]
*  They're pathetic because they don't represent their national interests at all. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3006.2400000000002s)]

*  Starmer, who seems to do nothing more than parrot MI6 lines. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3013.1200000000003s)]
*  Macron in France, Mertz in Germany. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3019.32s)]
*  They're all warmongers. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3024.52s)]
*  And Zelensky, who is Zelensky? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3026.36s)]
*  Zelensky was put in by, he's part of a regime put in by a coup. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3028.84s)]
*  He won an election, but an election in this post-coup regime. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3034.12s)]
*  He is way over his due date from his electoral mandate, as everybody knows. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3040.08s)]
*  He rules by martial law. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3047.0s)]
*  He's surrounded by complete hardliners. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3049.28s)]
*  And I've been told, I don't know if it's true or not, but senior people in Ukraine have [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3054.2000000000003s)]
*  said, well, he has no choice. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3061.5600000000004s)]
*  He'll get knocked off by his own side. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3063.0400000000004s)]
*  This could be completely true, but he's not representing the Ukrainian people who he's [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3066.2400000000002s)]
*  killing. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3070.48s)]
*  He's representing a clique that's in power right now. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3071.6000000000004s)]
*  So this is actually Trump's world. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3076.36s)]
*  To bring the war to a close requires a lot of coordinated activity. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3081.8s)]
*  It requires an absolutely unified team. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3090.6000000000004s)]
*  But remember, in Washington, everyone's partly bought out by someone else, by the military [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3097.2000000000003s)]
*  industrial complex. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3104.04s)]
*  And so you hear lots of cacophony. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3106.28s)]
*  You hear lots of confusion. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3108.8s)]
*  You hear lots of ultimatums given. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3112.0s)]
*  But President Trump's really trying to bring about peace. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3116.04s)]
*  Now what has happened is Trump has said, I want peace. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3121.1600000000003s)]
*  He's faced this mountain of deep state, or this chorus of deep state and European and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3132.04s)]
*  Zelensky opposition. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3140.96s)]
*  No, no, we want war. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3142.32s)]
*  We want war. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3144.4s)]
*  We don't want peace. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3145.4s)]
*  We'll never give in. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3146.4s)]
*  And he has, President Trump has usefully tried to maneuver both sides to the negotiating [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3148.2000000000003s)]
*  table. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3156.0s)]
*  And that we should give him all our support and all credit for doing that. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3157.96s)]
*  But this system is not tamped down in any way. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3164.8s)]
*  Because just before the recent round of this one hour, second meeting of the Russians and [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3170.0s)]
*  the Ukrainians, the Ukrainian SBU, the intelligence agency, launched two attacks deep inside Russia. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3181.9199999999996s)]
*  One a straightforward terrorist attack, blowing up a civilian railroad, killing a large number [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3194.0s)]
*  of children and people going off for holidays by blowing up a railroad and a railroad bridge [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3202.68s)]
*  inside Russia. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3211.72s)]
*  The second operation was profoundly more dangerous. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3213.3999999999996s)]
*  They have, Zelensky proudly gave it the name afterwards of Operation Spiderweb, which should [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3219.6s)]
*  tell you a lot. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3226.3599999999997s)]
*  And that was a drone attack on several military bases, hundreds or thousands of kilometers [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3227.92s)]
*  inside Russia's territory on Russia's strategic bomber fleet, meaning the Air Force that carries [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3239.0800000000004s)]
*  nuclear weapons. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3248.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3251.8s)]
*  This is no joke. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3252.8s)]
*  This is no small matter to attack. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3254.88s)]
*  Could the Ukrainians have done that without Western intelligence help? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3259.1200000000003s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3262.48s)]
*  So no matter how you feel about Donald Trump, it's hard to deny that his second term has [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3263.48s)]
*  been a whirlwind. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3266.6400000000003s)]
*  It's amazing how fast this administration is advancing its agenda, porting illegal aliens, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3269.2000000000003s)]
*  slashing government waste, an entirely new trade strategy. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3274.2400000000002s)]
*  No one has ever seen anything like it. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3278.08s)]
*  They are not messing around. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3279.56s)]
*  Now, many people are thrilled by this fast start, but it's going to take a lot more than [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3280.6400000000003s)]
*  this to achieve the ultimate goal. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3284.28s)]
*  And that's why our friends at the Heritage Foundation are mobilizing supporters, patriots [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3286.2000000000003s)]
*  across the country to support this administration and the broader conservative movement. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3289.76s)]
*  And they need your help to do that. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3294.2400000000002s)]

*  Heritage is fighting the problem. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3322.48s)]
*  I can say that. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3324.4s)]
*  Go to heritage.org slash survey to help them fill out the survey. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3325.4s)]
*  Heritage dot org slash survey. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3329.0s)]
*  This is a Western intelligence operation. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3331.6800000000003s)]
*  Well then, how? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3335.28s)]
*  Without question. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3336.28s)]
*  The White House wasn't, as far as I know, and I think this is right, the White House [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3337.32s)]
*  didn't know it was coming. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3340.96s)]
*  First of all, the CIA does not tell this White House a lot of things, no doubt. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3343.0s)]
*  Well, how can that be? [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3349.48s)]
*  Because partly it is- [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3351.7200000000003s)]
*  The CIA works for the president. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3352.7200000000003s)]
*  Partly it is a tradition of deniability. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3354.48s)]
*  So the CIA for decades and decades has done very, very dangerous things, not telling the [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3357.6000000000004s)]
*  president on the grounds that, well, better that the president doesn't quite know this [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3366.56s)]
*  because we need the president to be able to deny this. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3372.72s)]
*  Partly because it's not just that, but also because the CIA is a self-protecting, self-operating [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3378.4s)]
*  organization that has not had accountability for 50 years. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3390.96s)]
*  And so it is an out of control organization, in my opinion. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3396.32s)]
*  Well, how can you have a democracy if you've got a paramilitary intelligence gathering [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3400.2400000000002s)]
*  force that has no civilian control? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3404.56s)]
*  Our democracy is a democracy in form, but not in substance on many, many points. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3407.5800000000004s)]
*  Obviously, our foreign policy is not democratically determined. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3414.52s)]
*  Most of what the United States does is never explained or justified or voted by the American [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3419.72s)]
*  people. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3426.4399999999996s)]
*  So there's nothing democratic about American foreign policy, especially when we go to war. [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3427.4399999999996s)]
*  We go to war nonstop, either without saying anything to the American people or on the [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3431.7799999999997s)]
*  basis of outright lies. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3438.62s)]
*  And so there's nothing democratic about it at all. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3441.08s)]
*  Congress doesn't vote the wars. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3445.2s)]
*  We don't appropriate the funds. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3446.54s)]
*  It's done on contingency funding that is completely without public scrutiny, without public explanation. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3450.56s)]
*  Now on this particular event, of course, we've not heard anything except the White House [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3459.7599999999998s)]
*  declaring and saying to President Putin, we didn't know about it. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3468.56s)]
*  The fact of the matter is two alarming points. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3472.8399999999997s)]
*  One is whether or not the White House knew the operation itself is completely reckless [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3478.92s)]
*  and alarming because attacking part of the nuclear triad in this way is a step towards [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3488.28s)]
*  nuclear Armageddon. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3499.1600000000003s)]
*  Absolutely, provocatively, recklessly dangerous. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3501.0800000000004s)]
*  And for the White House to say we didn't know is horrifying. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3507.68s)]
*  Either they're lying or they're telling the truth. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3515.48s)]
*  If they're lying, that's one thing. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3518.8s)]
*  If they're telling the truth, it's also horrifying. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3520.76s)]
*  What the hell's going on? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3523.68s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3524.92s)]
*  So what's the thinking? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3525.92s)]
*  I mean, an act like that could trigger a nuclear exchange. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3526.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3530.96s)]
*  So why would you do it? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3531.96s)]
*  Because it's always been the case that desperate regimes like the Ukrainian regime will gamble [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3534.9599999999996s)]
*  the world for their own survival. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3547.72s)]
*  It's our job to understand that American foreign policy is not to support a reckless Ukrainian [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3551.12s)]
*  regime. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3559.2799999999997s)]
*  Given the number of leaders we've taken out, couped, assassinated, overthrown in [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3561.04s)]
*  color revolutions, whatever, same effect regime change, why not do that to Zelensky? [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3564.6s)]
*  What I believe we should do is very simple, and that is have a direct, clear, unambiguous [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3569.96s)]
*  negotiation with Russia over security issues. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3579.12s)]
*  And in the end, we can't control Ukraine, but they can't fight without the United States. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3583.7599999999998s)]
*  And because we have operated in this kind of ambiguous zone in the first months of the [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3592.56s)]
*  Trump administration, there is the ever-present effort of the deep state to turn the president. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3599.4s)]
*  And they know the president's turn. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3609.08s)]
*  They know they can do this if they're persistent enough. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3612.1600000000003s)]
*  They know they can keep up these operations. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3615.1600000000003s)]
*  They know, or they think they know, that eventually the combined voices of Lindsey Graham and [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3617.6400000000003s)]
*  other warmongers in Congress and the Europeans and Zelensky and pounding this, and the New [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3629.4s)]
*  York Times with its idiotic editorializing and all the rest will tell the president, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3638.28s)]
*  don't be an appeaser, don't give in, fight Russia. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3647.4s)]
*  You know how evil they are. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3651.1600000000003s)]
*  And so they believe that they'll ultimately win the fight. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3653.2000000000003s)]
*  President Trump has not put an end to that, I have to say. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3658.5600000000004s)]
*  So, well, I mean, obviously. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3664.52s)]
*  He can't put an end to people saying it, but he does have the constitutional authority [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3667.32s)]
*  to put an end to it from the point of view of the substance of U.S. foreign policy. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3674.32s)]
*  And that's the difference. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3680.5600000000004s)]
*  What he's wanted to do is to try to bring these groups along. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3682.7200000000003s)]
*  He's tried to say, yeah, we'll push the Russians. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3690.2400000000002s)]
*  He turns every couple of weeks against Putin in a post and so forth. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3696.68s)]
*  It's clear what he wants to do, which is to end the war, to extricate the United States [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3703.12s)]
*  from this. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3708.7599999999998s)]
*  But he's trying to have it both ways. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3709.7599999999998s)]
*  My own personal view is you can't. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3712.66s)]
*  President Trump has to understand, I'm sure he does, how deep the deep state is, how far [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3717.12s)]
*  down this goes, how this is not, by the way, only Biden's losing war. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3723.52s)]
*  It's also Obama's losing war. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3729.4s)]
*  It's also Bush Jr. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3731.6000000000004s)]
*  It goes back to Clinton. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3736.1200000000003s)]
*  This is a long story. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3738.1600000000003s)]
*  And Trump is trying to put an end to the story because it's a failure. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3740.56s)]
*  And he understands it's a complete failure. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3744.28s)]
*  And he's completely right when he says they don't have the, you know, we don't have the [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3746.2400000000002s)]
*  cards or Biden didn't have the cards. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3749.44s)]
*  He didn't know how to do this. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3752.0800000000004s)]
*  Completely correct. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3753.2s)]
*  But what he can't do is leave everything ambiguous because the way our system works is that the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3754.72s)]
*  war machine is revving all the time, all the time. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3762.12s)]
*  It's a big operation. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3767.68s)]
*  It's more than a trillion dollars a year war machine after all. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3769.12s)]
*  You know, if you count everything, probably one point five trillion dollars, and that's [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3772.8799999999997s)]
*  just the U.S. part of it. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3776.6s)]
*  Look at all the military contractors in Europe and all the rest that is faced. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3778.56s)]
*  So President Trump needs to close down that part by really ending the war. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3784.2400000000002s)]
*  And the way to end the war, sad to say, it's not by negotiations between Ukraine and Russia [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3794.92s)]
*  because we use these terms, Ukraine. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3801.76s)]
*  But what is Ukraine when it negotiates? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3805.4s)]
*  Zelensky and a small number of people in military rule. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3808.56s)]
*  OK, they have their own personal interests, maybe financial, maybe their heads, maybe [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3814.04s)]
*  they're not Ukraine. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3819.4s)]
*  So what can President Trump do? [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3822.16s)]
*  He can say clearly unambiguously a few points, sit down with President Putin, because these [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3825.2000000000003s)]
*  are the two superpowers involved in this war and say, we absolutely agree NATO will not [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3832.84s)]
*  enlarge because this is a U.S. military alliance. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3842.8s)]
*  And we, by treaty, agree that that will stop because that's part of our mutual security [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3847.1200000000003s)]
*  arrangement with you. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3852.6400000000003s)]
*  We recognize Crimea as Russian because we understand that this goes back to 1783. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3854.4s)]
*  It goes back to 1856. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3862.04s)]
*  It goes back to 1997. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3864.24s)]
*  It goes back to 2014. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3866.24s)]
*  We don't want to play that game anymore. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3868.16s)]
*  On this basis, Stammer and Macron and Mertz and Tusk and they can all jump up and down, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3872.12s)]
*  but they can't do anything anymore. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3881.32s)]
*  And Lindsey Graham can't do anything anymore on this. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3883.96s)]
*  The war will stop. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3887.52s)]
*  This is really we're close, by the way. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3889.2799999999997s)]
*  It's not far from that. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3891.92s)]
*  But the point is what Trump has been saying is, I want the Ukrainians to agree, but they [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3893.54s)]
*  have a different agenda. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3902.62s)]
*  And it's not the agenda for Ukraine. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3904.94s)]
*  President Trump is speaking more for the Ukrainian people than Zelensky is. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3908.84s)]
*  This is the point. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3913.14s)]
*  So I think the status quo, as I understand it as of right now, which is Monday, June [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3914.2s)]
*  9th, is that negotiation, you know, that it's hard to negotiate your way out. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3919.6s)]
*  And I don't think the president, you know, he didn't start this war. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3926.52s)]
*  He's frustrated. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3929.64s)]
*  He doesn't want to take credit for it. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3930.64s)]
*  He doesn't. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3931.64s)]
*  So the current view, and I think he said this in public, is, you know, I'm backing off. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3932.64s)]
*  You guys fight it out. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3938.16s)]
*  What are the risks in that? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3940.48s)]
*  I would go further, which is I would say the US and Russia have real security issues, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3942.52s)]
*  and they became even more dramatic after MI6, CIA, SBU attacked the Russian strategic triad. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3952.24s)]
*  The bomber fleet. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3966.7599999999998s)]
*  The bomber fleet. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3967.7599999999998s)]
*  So we need to sit down with the Russians, and it's just the two of us negotiating. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3969.1s)]
*  We don't have Stammer there. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3976.3199999999997s)]
*  We don't have Macron there. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3977.68s)]
*  We don't have Zelensky there. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3979.36s)]
*  This after all is between the two leading nuclear superpowers of the world that we not [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3981.22s)]
*  go any farther than that. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3988.02s)]
*  President Trump can say, I'm concerned about what our own intelligence agencies may have [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3990.92s)]
*  been doing. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3994.88s)]
*  How could it be that for 18 months this was being planned and they didn't know? [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=3995.96s)]
*  If that's the truth, that is a level of incompetence beyond imagining we have to clean up our shop. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4003.7400000000002s)]
*  Or if they did know and they didn't tell me, that is a level of recklessness that we have [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4010.48s)]
*  to clean up because it's completely unacceptable for the security of the American people. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4016.6s)]
*  And in the meantime, I and President Putin have some real discussions to do. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4022.26s)]
*  What they would come up with would be clear demarcations that would keep the two superpowers [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4029.5400000000004s)]
*  from each other's neck, like the Ukrainian attack, which is completely unacceptable, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4037.86s)]
*  endangers the entire world and is preventable by the president of the United States. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4045.42s)]
*  On that basis, then I would say after that, if Ukraine wants to continue to fight on without [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4052.04s)]
*  any of our support, any of our weapons, not buying weapons by the way, not anything, period, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4060.68s)]
*  okay, they can do so, but we're done being endangered by this recklessness. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4067.48s)]
*  I resent completely that Zelensky endangered my family last week. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4074.12s)]
*  I agree. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4080.16s)]
*  Completely. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4081.3999999999996s)]
*  But it's not, I mean, you're describing a scenario where this war is being run by three [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4082.3999999999996s)]
*  intelligence services in your description, CIA, MI6, and SBU, without democratic input, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4087.3199999999997s)]
*  without control by elected leaders, including the president of the United States, and without [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4094.3199999999997s)]
*  the interests of the nations at heart. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4099.36s)]
*  Can you just define sort of a little more precisely what's going on? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4103.7s)]
*  And let's start with MI6. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4106.96s)]
*  What is MI6 and what's their role? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4108.0s)]
*  Just to say, the war is being fought with the Ukrainian troops dying and with a flow [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4110.12s)]
*  of armaments that has been in the pipeline. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4118.68s)]
*  That pipeline can stop and then the war will stop. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4122.82s)]
*  So it's not, I don't want to imply that the CIA, MI6, BND, SBU can fight the war on their [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4127.66s)]
*  own. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4136.88s)]
*  They can't. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4137.88s)]
*  The pipeline exists because it still is the Biden pipeline. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4139.04s)]
*  It still is whatever Europe is managing. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4143.32s)]
*  But that pipeline of armaments and finance is basically coming to an end. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4147.56s)]
*  And Trump should end it definitively. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4154.96s)]
*  And then Ukrainians literally can't fight. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4159.24s)]
*  Of course, Europe would try little bits here and there. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4164.08s)]
*  And if they're stupider and more reckless than one can imagine, they may try more stunts [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4170.36s)]
*  like the ones that they did a couple of weeks ago, which endangered the whole world. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4179.24s)]
*  But they cannot fight a war afterwards. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4184.28s)]
*  At that point, what would happen? [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4188.04s)]
*  What would happen is either Russia indeed takes over essentially Ukraine in terms of [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4191.08s)]
*  military occupation or a peace is reached. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4198.92s)]
*  One of the two things happens. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4202.36s)]
*  But that's how to stop the war is to stop the pipeline of funding. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4205.04s)]
*  When I talk about the deep state role, they are the cheerleaders. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4210.5199999999995s)]
*  They are the managers. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4215.96s)]
*  They are the designers. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4217.16s)]
*  They are not at a stage where they appropriate their own funds. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4219.24s)]
*  So I don't want to be misunderstood in that way. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4222.24s)]
*  They cannot continue the war. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4225.04s)]
*  But they're very powerful in the US system. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4227.36s)]
*  And in the US system, this war has not been an unpopular war for the US. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4230.32s)]
*  It's been a deep state project for more than 30 years. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4238.72s)]
*  The idea was to shield the American people from it, mainly secret. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4243.5599999999995s)]
*  Once in a while, like we had the story about how the CIA was operating all over Ukraine [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4249.96s)]
*  that the New York Times ran one day. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4255.88s)]
*  You hear bits and pieces, but the idea is to shield the American people from these wars. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4258.32s)]
*  The main way we do it is that we don't have our boots on the ground. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4263.5599999999995s)]
*  Just lack of information. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4266.599999999999s)]
*  It's the Ukrainians dying. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4267.599999999999s)]
*  So there's no body bags coming home to us. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4269.5599999999995s)]
*  The body bags, if they go back at all, they go back to Ukraine. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4272.92s)]
*  So the idea is not that they are the ones that can make the war happen. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4277.28s)]
*  They are the main lobbyists for the war. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4287.68s)]
*  They are the main protagonists. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4289.76s)]
*  They are the deep strategists of what should be done. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4291.32s)]
*  Of course, there's a military component also, not only the intelligence system, but both [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4296.6s)]
*  are playing their role. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4301.84s)]
*  But the president can stop this. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4303.76s)]
*  All I'm saying is that it's a lot of political effort to stop it. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4306.84s)]
*  And he is facing a wall of this deep state opposition. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4311.12s)]
*  And the way out of that is actually not the tactic that he's been pursuing of getting [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4317.04s)]
*  the Ukrainians to agree. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4324.56s)]
*  From the Ukrainian option, the better thing is run around to the CIA, to MI6, to all the [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4327.400000000001s)]
*  other agencies, run around to the European leaders, run to everyone to try to turn Donald [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4335.4800000000005s)]
*  Trump. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4343.320000000001s)]
*  And I'm saying what President Trump has is two things. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4344.56s)]
*  One is he has constitutional authority. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4349.88s)]
*  And the second, he and he alone has the direct line to President Putin. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4352.4s)]
*  And the two superpowers are the protagonists in this fundamentally. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4358.36s)]
*  And they can end the war between the two of them, not to stop the Ukrainians from fighting, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4363.28s)]
*  but to stop Ukraine from having the means to fight. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4369.24s)]
*  The Ukrainians can't fight one day without US intelligence, by the way, not just the [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4373.28s)]
*  armaments, but without the intelligence. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4378.4s)]
*  But if President Trump gave that order, would it be affected? [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4381.12s)]
*  I mean, who's the last president to control the CIA, last US president who had actual [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4385.88s)]
*  control over CIA? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4390.48s)]
*  No one had actual control over the CIA. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4393.68s)]
*  Ever? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4396.72s)]
*  Ever. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4397.72s)]
*  Because most of the time, with one pertinent, horrible example, presidents have gone along [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4398.72s)]
*  with the CIA. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4407.36s)]
*  Of course, the one horrible, shocking, disgusting example is John F. Kennedy, who famously said [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4409.04s)]
*  that he would like to take the CIA and tear it into a thousand pieces. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4420.48s)]
*  And maybe those were his last words, in essence. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4425.5199999999995s)]
*  So if you look big picture at the United States, you don't have a real country as long as the [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4429.92s)]
*  CIA. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4434.68s)]
*  Everything since November of 63 has been post-coup. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4436.400000000001s)]
*  I believe that we have not brought this absolutely dangerous part of our government under any [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4440.12s)]
*  effective control for a half century. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4451.04s)]
*  The last time that there was any slight measure of control and accountability was 1975, 50 [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4454.8s)]
*  years ago, with the church committee, Frank Church from Idaho. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4464.92s)]
*  Uniquely in the whole history of the CIA since 1947, did a real investigation. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4470.56s)]
*  Of course, as soon as they looked under the covers, it was horrifying. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4478.56s)]
*  Horrifying what they found. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4485.76s)]
*  They found recklessness, assassinations, coups, regime change operations, MKUltra, the shocking [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4487.16s)]
*  CIA attempts to create assassins and Manchurian candidates, so-called, and experimentation [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4498.5199999999995s)]
*  hallucinogens for the sake of intelligence operations. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4516.28s)]
*  Really vulgar, disgusting, awful stuff. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4522.28s)]
*  That was 1975. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4526.6s)]
*  That's the last time there has been an actual accounting of what the CIA has done. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4529.32s)]
*  Let me give just the most pertinent example of what we're talking about. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4536.84s)]
*  What actually happened in the so-called Maidan, in the coup, in 2014? [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4541.240000000001s)]
*  Do we know every point? [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4548.200000000001s)]
*  I happen to know certain things just because I saw certain things with my own eyes. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4550.120000000001s)]
*  I was told certain things. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4554.200000000001s)]
*  But has anything been explained in a single day once? [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4556.200000000001s)]
*  Has the New York Times ever run an honest story? [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4561.0s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4565.96s)]
*  Has the government ever been called to account even once? [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4567.160000000001s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4572.76s)]
*  Has there been a public hearing in the Senate even once of an event that [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4573.88s)]
*  affects our security absolutely fundamentally? [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4580.92s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4585.160000000001s)]
*  And I could go on with 50 examples like this, where the deep state is unaccountable, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4587.4800000000005s)]
*  where there are no answers, where nothing is heard. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4595.4s)]
*  Yesterday we heard about Area 51. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4598.679999999999s)]
*  We heard about how the U.S. military concocted phony stories, which lived for decades, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4603.24s)]
*  in order to hide secret weapons development programs. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4613.5599999999995s)]
*  Our government lies every day, the security state. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4618.679999999999s)]
*  And the danger of that is that, don't call that national security. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4623.8s)]
*  This is national insecurity. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4631.5599999999995s)]
*  We have never been more endangered than we are today. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4634.36s)]
*  It's so weird. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4637.88s)]
*  We should be the safest country in the history of the world. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4639.5599999999995s)]
*  And we would be if it were not for the risk of nuclear war. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4644.36s)]
*  And yet we're closer to that than at any time because of the stupidity, I have to say, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4649.72s)]
*  of these deep state, unexamined, unaccountable strategies of going up against other major [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4656.84s)]
*  powers in the most reckless ways. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4664.68s)]
*  And I use the language because we're just a few days after an absolutely disgusting, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4667.32s)]
*  unacceptable intelligence agency operation attacking strategic bombers deep inside Russia. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4675.24s)]
*  Well, how long before there's like an attack that Russia can't ignore and that does lead? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4682.84s)]
*  I mean, it seems like all the incentives are in place for the Ukrainians working with MI6 [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4691.639999999999s)]
*  and CIA to push us into a global conflict with Russia. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4698.2s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4702.599999999999s)]
*  And if it's not Ukraine, it's Israel or someone else. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4703.32s)]
*  There's so many. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4708.04s)]
*  Our foreign policy is so suborned, so much not in America's interest, so much used by [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4709.4s)]
*  the military industrial state or particular lobbies in favor of particular places. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4719.96s)]
*  We could be yanked into war for absolutely no consequential reasons whatsoever when we should [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4726.68s)]
*  be enjoying the height of our national security. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4736.4400000000005s)]
*  And in 1991, I witnessed it with my own eyes. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4740.6s)]
*  We had everything we could have ever dreamt. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4744.200000000001s)]
*  Our erstwhile foe. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4748.360000000001s)]
*  And that's another long story why they were the foe. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4753.16s)]
*  But our erstwhile foe of the Cold War said, we don't want to be an enemy. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4755.88s)]
*  We want to be friends. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4761.400000000001s)]
*  We want to open up. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4763.400000000001s)]
*  We want to reform. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4764.6s)]
*  We want to be with you. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4766.04s)]
*  In fact, of course, famously, Putin said, we want to be part of NATO. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4767.64s)]
*  He did. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4773.88s)]
*  And it's no joke. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4774.52s)]
*  And when Putin came in, by the way, he was completely pro-American and pro-European. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4776.12s)]
*  I know. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4782.6s)]
*  Completely. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4783.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, he still is the most pro-Western leader that country will ever have again. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4784.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4788.28s)]
*  No, it's unbelievable. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4788.759999999999s)]
*  We can't accept peace for an answer. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4790.679999999999s)]
*  But that's why the president of the United States has to stop the war machine. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4793.4s)]
*  To the second conflict raging that, as you just said, has the potential to engulf the [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4799.32s)]
*  world, and then that's Iran, which is obviously connected to a bunch of other conflicts around [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4807.240000000001s)]
*  that region. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4815.08s)]
*  Where are we in averting a war with Iran right now? [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4816.360000000001s)]
*  Good news, of course, is that President Trump is negotiating. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4822.68s)]
*  He's resisting Netanyahu's constant call for the US to go to war with Iran. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4828.2s)]
*  And that call by Bibi for yet another war in the Middle East is yet another of these [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4838.12s)]
*  long-term deep state projects. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4845.72s)]
*  This is an Israeli project primarily, but the US has been a party to Netanyahu's wars [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4848.44s)]
*  going back essentially 30 years. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4855.56s)]
*  Netanyahu came to office as prime minister of Israel first in 1996. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4859.160000000001s)]
*  He did it with the backing of US political advisors, many of whom became senior US officials. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4866.360000000001s)]
*  And he did it on the basis of a strategy, a political strategy called Clean Break. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4875.400000000001s)]
*  Back in 1996, and what Clean Break meant was a clean break with the idea of the two-state solution. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4883.0s)]
*  So the two-state solution means that there should be a state of Israel and a state of Palestine [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4894.679999999999s)]
*  living side by side. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4901.16s)]
*  That goes back to the United Nations 1947 partition plan idea. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4902.5199999999995s)]
*  Netanyahu leads a political party, the Likud, and a political alliance, which holds that Israel [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4909.4800000000005s)]
*  should dominate all of the lands of that region, including Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4920.28s)]
*  but also into Lebanon and Syria and borders undefined, but a very expansive view of what [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4930.68s)]
*  Israel's rule should be. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4939.400000000001s)]
*  That's a quite outlandish and outrageous idea to most of the world, and I would say to most [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4942.92s)]
*  Americans who say, look, just make peace and get on with it. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4951.08s)]
*  And the Palestinians who are 8 million people should have their place. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4955.88s)]
*  And the Israelis who are 8 million people should have their place and get on with it. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4959.32s)]
*  But this idea of the Clean Break is, no, we don't want to get on with it. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4967.48s)]
*  We want to control everything. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4972.599999999999s)]
*  And Netanyahu's philosophy, or not philosophy, but his strategy, because it isn't just tactics, [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4974.92s)]
*  it's strategy. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4982.36s)]
*  The strategy is we know there'll be a lot of resistance. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4983.5599999999995s)]
*  Our domination over the Palestinian people, apartheid regime, ethnic cleansing, when we [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4988.12s)]
*  can get away with it, and so forth. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4993.72s)]
*  So we're going to face opposition. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4996.76s)]
*  We will face even militant opposition, Hamas or Hezbollah, and so forth. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=4999.08s)]
*  But Netanyahu pointed out something which is actually correct. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5006.04s)]
*  In the late 1990s and early 2000s, he says these militants basically don't operate on [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5010.68s)]
*  their own. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5018.76s)]
*  That's true in general of these groups that we fight. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5019.56s)]
*  They are state-backed. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5023.240000000001s)]
*  And it has been true that Hezbollah and Hamas, for example, were backed by Iran for most [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5025.4800000000005s)]
*  of this period. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5034.92s)]
*  And so the idea of Netanyahu is don't make peace. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5036.360000000001s)]
*  We want to win. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5041.08s)]
*  We want to get all the territory. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5042.12s)]
*  We don't accept two states. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5044.12s)]
*  We don't accept Palestinian rights and so forth. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5047.0s)]
*  We will win. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5050.92s)]
*  But we don't win by defeating militant groups. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5052.360000000001s)]
*  We win by destroying the governments that support those groups. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5056.360000000001s)]
*  And that means war. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5062.28s)]
*  And it really means endless wars. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5064.360000000001s)]
*  And the US became the complicit party to this because of the US deep state vision [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5067.88s)]
*  of that Israel is our battleship or aircraft carrier in the Middle East, that it is our [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5079.0s)]
*  strategic asset in the Middle East, and because of the Zionist lobby, which is itself a [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5086.52s)]
*  complicated political concoction in the United States. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5092.76s)]
*  But in any event, the US completely bought into the Netanyahu idea, which is war after [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5096.76s)]
*  war after war. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5106.76s)]
*  And it's not well understood, but it should be because we've been told pretty clearly [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5108.52s)]
*  by no less than General Wesley Clark, for example, who was the commander of NATO forces, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5116.2s)]
*  that the Pentagon has had a list of wars to prosecute that essentially is Netanyahu's [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5126.2s)]
*  list, actually, after 9-11 in particular, that went into overdrive. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5136.5199999999995s)]
*  The US, as Wesley Clark was told, and as he subsequently explained to us, and as others [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5143.88s)]
*  have also explained to us, an Air Force commander named Dennis Fritz, who wrote a very important [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5154.28s)]
*  book called Deadly Betrayal in 2024, telling the same story in essence. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5162.84s)]
*  The Pentagon had a list which the neoconservatives or the deep state of the US would carry out, [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5169.56s)]
*  which was we would take out the regimes in opposition to Israel. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5177.320000000001s)]
*  And those regimes included, it's a long list. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5184.68s)]
*  Of course, not only the Palestinians, that's the point, but also Syria. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5190.280000000001s)]
*  That was the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which was viewed by Netanyahu and by the US deep [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5196.28s)]
*  state as an Iranian client. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5205.32s)]
*  So Syria would be one, Lebanon would be another, Iraq under Saddam Hussein would be another, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5208.599999999999s)]
*  the Iranian regime would be a fourth. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5218.599999999999s)]
*  And then, believe it or not, three countries in Africa, which are Islamic countries that [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5222.6s)]
*  supported the Palestinian cause. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5231.160000000001s)]
*  And that was more of our Qadhafi's Libya, that was Somalia on the Horn of Africa, [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5233.64s)]
*  and that was Sudan, which was a Sharia state in the 1990s. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5241.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, goddamn, we've been to war with all of them except Iran, and not by accident. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5249.08s)]
*  The list is literally the guide in this case. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5257.24s)]
*  And again, it's not simple for Americans to connect the dots, because these stories are not [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5263.639999999999s)]
*  told, they're not explained, they're not debated, they're not voted. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5272.28s)]
*  These are presidential actions, by and large, one after another. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5278.679999999999s)]
*  So let's go through them step by step. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5284.28s)]
*  One is the Iraq War 2003. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5287.719999999999s)]
*  We now know not only was it under wrong pretenses, weapons of mass destruction that didn't exist, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5291.08s)]
*  it was under completely phony, concocted, false pretenses. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5299.799999999999s)]
*  And in 2002, the Pentagon actually did a PR analysis of how to sell the war to the American [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5306.04s)]
*  people, a unit by a guy named Abe Shulsky. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5316.04s)]
*  And he came up with a PR strategy, literally public relations, that the right narrative [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5320.36s)]
*  was weapons of mass destruction. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5326.679999999999s)]
*  So this is not as it was subsequently told to us, oh, we made a mistake. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5328.839999999999s)]
*  We didn't know that Saddam didn't have them. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5333.96s)]
*  This was a concocted narrative in 2002 to justify a war in 2003 to take away a regime [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5337.719999999999s)]
*  that Netanyahu deemed to be hostile to Israel. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5347.799999999999s)]
*  Then in 2011, again, something very basic, but not understood by the American people, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5352.599999999999s)]
*  because again, the government lies and cheats and doesn't explain, the US went to war in Syria. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5362.28s)]
*  Now, this was not a declared war. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5373.16s)]
*  There was never a presidential speech. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5375.5599999999995s)]
*  But the president said, President Obama said, Assad must go. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5378.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, every time you hear an American president say some other leader must go, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5386.2s)]
*  say, oh my gosh, here we go again. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5392.28s)]
*  And the president signed a presidential finding called Operation Timber Sycamore, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5395.719999999999s)]
*  assigning the CIA with the task of organizing, training, financing and arming an insurgency to [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5403.639999999999s)]
*  overthrow Assad. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5411.48s)]
*  That came to fruition just in recent months. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5413.8s)]
*  That's how the new government came in. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5418.599999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, very much unfortunately, it was after 13 years of war that killed hundreds of [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5420.919999999999s)]
*  thousands of people and destroyed sites in Syria that date back thousands of years. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5431.48s)]
*  In other words, it was a destruction of one of the heritage sites of humanity because [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5439.16s)]
*  Netanyahu said that guy's too close to Iran. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5446.6s)]
*  We need to take him out. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5450.360000000001s)]
*  Then we can ask you a question. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5452.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5454.200000000001s)]
*  So and by the way, in flooded Europe with migrants to that's another completely destabilized Europe [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5454.360000000001s)]
*  forever. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5461.0s)]
*  Another fascinating story is all these migrants came in and wrecked European politics. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5461.56s)]
*  Not one politician in Europe said, oh, the United States shouldn't have shouldn't be [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5467.4800000000005s)]
*  engaged in an overthrow of Syria. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5473.56s)]
*  They can't connect the dots because everything's a lie. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5475.72s)]
*  All the narratives are narratives. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5480.200000000001s)]
*  So when Obama comes out and says Assad must go, which I think in retrospect was a pivot point [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5482.76s)]
*  in modern history like that because Syria is not Yemen. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5487.88s)]
*  It's on the Mediterranean. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5491.64s)]
*  By the way, Syria was viewed up until then. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5493.88s)]
*  There's an IMF report, which I like to cite of 2009 praising the authorities on their [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5497.400000000001s)]
*  growth strategy and reform. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5503.4s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5505.16s)]
*  This is deciding to overthrow a country and without an iota of public discussion. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5506.44s)]
*  This is Hillary. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5515.24s)]
*  But a nice country, a civilized country with lots of doctors and accountants and scientists [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5515.88s)]
*  and like it's a real place. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5521.88s)]
*  And of course you paint the dictator to be the worst evil ever and so forth. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5523.0s)]
*  His wife had just appeared on the cover of Vogue when. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5528.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5531.0s)]
*  But whatever one says about Assad and so forth, the United States should not be overthrowing [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5531.32s)]
*  the government through a CIA operation. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5537.719999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5540.04s)]
*  And hundreds of thousands dead. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5540.679999999999s)]
*  And it was a domino that led to greater human suffering and the destabilizing of Europe itself. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5543.32s)]
*  So it was a really, really big deal. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5549.799999999999s)]
*  I just want to go back and linger for a second on why. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5551.96s)]
*  Why? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5556.2s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5556.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was sort of a non sequitur. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5557.639999999999s)]
*  Obama stands up and was like, Assad must go. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5559.719999999999s)]
*  Assad who? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5561.32s)]
*  Why do we care about Assad? [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5561.96s)]
*  Syria's on the list. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5563.16s)]
*  It's Iranian influence. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5564.36s)]
*  We got to take out Assad. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5566.44s)]
*  So it was purely for Israel, you're saying. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5567.799999999999s)]
*  I think very substantially. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5569.719999999999s)]
*  I'll tell you again, Dennis Fritz, very interesting. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5571.799999999999s)]
*  He's a very smart former Air Force commander who strangely enough resigned from the Air Force in 2003 [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5575.4s)]
*  because he couldn't get a clear explanation of why we were fighting Iraq. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5589.32s)]
*  And he's a very nice man. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5595.8s)]
*  And he said, I can't lead my troops if I can't explain. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5597.24s)]
*  And he was told from above, well, because we have the orders to. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5600.76s)]
*  This order came from the White House. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5604.5199999999995s)]
*  And so he said, I can't lead the troops under these circumstances. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5606.5199999999995s)]
*  So he resigned. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5610.76s)]
*  Then he was called back in 2005 to the Pentagon for a remarkable reason. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5612.44s)]
*  And that was the Douglas Fythe, who was a senior Pentagon official, a neocon close to Netanyahu. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5621.24s)]
*  The whole shebang said, we want to declassify papers around the Iraq War. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5628.36s)]
*  And OK, so Fythe came back because he was an expert on classification. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5637.16s)]
*  And security issues and so forth. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5642.92s)]
*  Why did Fythe want to do that? [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5645.48s)]
*  Because he was writing his memoirs. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5647.48s)]
*  And so he wanted to include documents in his book. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5649.56s)]
*  So he hired Fythe and he Fythe hired Dennis Fritz. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5652.92s)]
*  And Fritz got to read everything. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5658.44s)]
*  Where did this war come from? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5662.2s)]
*  What are all the communications? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5663.64s)]
*  So he's a little bit like Daniel Ellsberg in the Pentagon papers. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5665.56s)]
*  Suddenly, he's sitting there in 2005 reading all the files. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5669.48s)]
*  And he only wrote about this 20 years later in this book, Deadly Betrayal. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5674.36s)]
*  And I got to speak with him at length and interviewed him. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5679.879999999999s)]
*  He's a wonderful, gentle soul. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5683.32s)]
*  And he said he was shocked by what he read because he's reading it. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5686.2s)]
*  And he realizes this is Bebe's war. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5690.28s)]
*  We're going to war because Israel said so. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5693.32s)]
*  And Fythe was Bebe's man. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5696.36s)]
*  But how could Douglas Fythe, who's an American citizen and an American official [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5700.28s)]
*  at the American Pentagon, do the bidding of a foreign government like that? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5706.36s)]
*  Because America has been doing Israel's bidding for 30 years. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5711.48s)]
*  Because of the Israel lobby, because of the concocted idea that this is US security. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5715.96s)]
*  But sending young people to die? [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5721.16s)]
*  That's a pretty heavy thing to do. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5723.4s)]
*  As long as it's not American people to die. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5725.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, in that case, it was. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5727.5599999999995s)]
*  In that case, it was more heavy. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5729.24s)]
*  But actually, I apologize for that statement. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5730.76s)]
*  Because most of the wars, we don't send our own Americans. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5734.04s)]
*  We send their young people to die. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5736.76s)]
*  But in the Iraq War, if you ask how we could do it, OK, it's a good question. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5738.84s)]
*  That war, I can't use the proper word that I would like to use because it's absolutely obscene. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5745.8s)]
*  But that war was so phony, so completely unjustified, so reckless. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5754.12s)]
*  That was a real turning point because it was so brazenly wrongheaded. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5762.12s)]
*  And who was the great cheerleader of that war in the fall of 2002? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5768.2s)]
*  And I encourage people go online and watch it on tape. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5773.16s)]
*  Watch Bebe Netanyahu say how wonderful this war will be. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5776.5199999999995s)]
*  Because Saddam will fall and that will lead to a chain reaction across the Middle East [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5781.8s)]
*  of bringing down the tyrants. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5788.36s)]
*  Bebe Netanyahu is full of, and I also won't say it, but this is how he's been for 30 years. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5791.16s)]
*  And the US has done his bidding. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5799.0s)]
*  And in that case, and again, I apologize for my slip. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5801.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes, we sent our own to die. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5805.96s)]
*  Out of complete phony, phony pretenses, not wrong, not mistaken, not an illusion, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5808.68s)]
*  not a, but because of a PR exercise to fight a war, because we must understand that behind [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5817.8s)]
*  everything we're talking about, whether it's expanding NATO, whether it's bringing down [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5826.68s)]
*  Russia, whether it is fighting and bringing down Saddam or Assad or Gaddafi, the arrogance [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5833.48s)]
*  in Washington is the first point of reference. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5843.32s)]
*  They don't believe this is hard. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5847.88s)]
*  They don't believe it's costly. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5851.639999999999s)]
*  They don't believe it will go wrong. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5854.28s)]
*  They screw up every time. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5857.639999999999s)]
*  They fail every time and they get promoted every time. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5860.68s)]
*  They don't go away when they lose. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5864.92s)]
*  Look at Lindsey Graham. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5867.56s)]
*  He's been wrong on every single war on every single piece of American foreign policy. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5868.76s)]
*  And he's still standing up there telling us what to do because there's no accountability. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5875.64s)]
*  But also no shame or inter compass. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5881.96s)]
*  I mean, you would think. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5883.88s)]
*  Of course, no shame. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5884.92s)]
*  But don't you feel shame when you're wrong? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5886.68s)]
*  Especially when you try to be right. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5889.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5891.08s)]
*  Your bad decisions hurt people. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5891.64s)]
*  I mean, gosh. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5893.16s)]
*  Well, we don't have that. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5893.96s)]
*  We don't have any reflection or accountability. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5895.32s)]
*  And that is literally the case on all of this. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5898.92s)]
*  When you go back to bringing down Assad in Operation Timber Sycamore, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5902.2s)]
*  I think I've checked a couple of times. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5907.4s)]
*  I think the New York Times, again, I refer to that because it used to be the paper I read. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5909.24s)]
*  I think they mentioned it three times from 2012 onward. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5913.96s)]
*  That's all. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5921.56s)]
*  So how can the American people understand any of it? [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5922.44s)]
*  And interestingly, amazingly, Russia came into the Syrian conflict in 2015. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5926.36s)]
*  And what was our reaction? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5934.2s)]
*  How dare Russia interfere? [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5935.4800000000005s)]
*  In other words, the phoniest narrative that there goes Putin again [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5938.04s)]
*  when we have been inside for four years, [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5942.92s)]
*  militarily trying to overthrow the other government. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5947.56s)]
*  Then came just after that, by the way, after Assad must go, [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5951.08s)]
*  then they took out Gaddafi. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5956.68s)]
*  That was a NATO operation in which the US, France, and the United States. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5958.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jeff, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5964.36s)]
*  It was a NATO oper- I know that NATO is a defensive alliance. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5966.04s)]
*  That's, yes. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5969.4800000000005s)]
*  So why would, right, defending the North Atlantic, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5970.6s)]
*  why would NATO be killing leaders in Africa? [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5973.72s)]
*  Because we needed to have the French, the British, and the Americans together [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5978.6s)]
*  to murder the leader of Libya and overthrow the government. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5984.280000000001s)]
*  That's why. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5989.320000000001s)]
*  And so- [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5990.52s)]
*  Did Libya get a lot better? [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5991.0s)]
*  Libya has been in nonstop war since then. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5993.400000000001s)]
*  Again, profound destruction, massive loss of life, and ongoing civil war. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=5997.96s)]
*  And if, since I know many, many leaders around the world, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6005.0s)]
*  I've asked them repeatedly why Gaddafi in 2011. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6012.36s)]
*  And you know what they tell me? [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6022.2s)]
*  The leaders who are as close as can be to this, we don't know. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6023.879999999999s)]
*  We, maybe Sarkozy hated him. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6028.92s)]
*  Maybe Gaddafi funded Sarkozy's campaign. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6032.36s)]
*  We don't know what this was really about. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6035.719999999999s)]
*  I've talked to recently an African president very close to the scene, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6038.679999999999s)]
*  a very senior former African president who said to me, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6043.24s)]
*  Jeff, I can't give you the answer to that question. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6047.639999999999s)]
*  I've asked, he's been involved. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6051.0s)]
*  I'll tell you another thing, quite interesting, by the way, about these wars. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6053.56s)]
*  In 2012, after the Syrian war broke out because of the United States, [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6058.76s)]
*  by the way, they say, no, it was the Syrian people, the Free Syrian Army, and so forth. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6070.76s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, tell me about it. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6076.68s)]
*  Who armed them? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6079.16s)]
*  Who paid for them? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6080.04s)]
*  Who trained them? [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6080.92s)]
*  Who gave them military bases? [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6081.72s)]
*  Of course, this is a CIA operation. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6083.72s)]
*  Stop talking romantically about this domestic insurrection. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6086.12s)]
*  This was a government operation. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6091.72s)]
*  Okay, after it started, the UN tried to stop the war because failing to stop it, [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6094.04s)]
*  there would be massive death and destruction. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6101.88s)]
*  And in fact, there have been hundreds of thousands of deaths after the fact. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6104.2s)]
*  So a person I absolutely loved, Kofi Annan, the former secretary general of the UN, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6108.68s)]
*  went as the special envoy of the secretary general to Syria. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6117.24s)]
*  And he met all the parties. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6122.76s)]
*  And Kofi Annan was a brilliant personality and a brilliant statesman. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6124.6s)]
*  And he told me just before resigning in the spring of 2012, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6131.08s)]
*  Jeff, there was a negotiated agreement. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6137.96s)]
*  Peace could have come. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6142.68s)]
*  But there was one party that said no. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6144.2s)]
*  And that was the United States. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6148.28s)]
*  And I asked, why did the United States block the peace agreement? [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6150.92s)]
*  He said, because the United States insisted that the only agreement it would sign would be one [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6157.320000000001s)]
*  in which Assad would leave the first day. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6164.68s)]
*  And Kofi Annan said to me, when I tried to say to the Americans that, well, there will be a process [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6169.72s)]
*  and under the agreement, there will be elections and so forth, so there'll be a process. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6175.72s)]
*  Said, no, no, we will only agree if it's the first day. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6180.36s)]
*  So this is how American arrogance works. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6186.04s)]
*  How you end up with 500,000 dead. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6190.04s)]
*  How you end up with whatever this regime is in Syria right now. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6193.08s)]
*  It took 14 years. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6200.36s)]
*  It didn't come out of the blue. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6202.28s)]
*  It was an American operation from the start. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6204.6s)]
*  It then morphed in several ways. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6207.48s)]
*  But this is a long-term story. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6210.92s)]
*  And all of this is to say, and I mentioned not just Libya, but also Somalia, also Sudan, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6213.32s)]
*  where the United States, it did an absolutely amazing thing. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6222.04s)]
*  It supported an insurgency in what was then southern Sudan to break apart Sudan, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6227.72s)]
*  because Sudan was an Islamist state supporting Palestine, blah, blah, blah. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6235.8s)]
*  So we had to destroy Sudan. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6241.08s)]
*  And they funded an insurgency for a long time. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6243.64s)]
*  And then the United States, quote, brokered a peace to give independence to South Sudan. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6247.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6253.96s)]
*  The American geniuses have created an instability so great that we not only have two Sudans, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6256.2s)]
*  Sudan and South Sudan, we have civil wars in both Sudans. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6264.36s)]
*  So this is ongoing, nonstop, massive deaths through another concoction. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6268.76s)]
*  Of clean break, BB, the deep state. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6277.719999999999s)]
*  This is a disaster. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6281.88s)]
*  But it all goes back to the same route. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6283.639999999999s)]
*  And the last country on that list, as you said at the outset, is Iran. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6285.4s)]
*  We were hearing this week that Iran is just weeks away from building a nuclear weapon. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6289.96s)]
*  And so we need to take out the nuclear sites. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6296.04s)]
*  We need to effect regime change in Iran. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6298.36s)]
*  I feel like I've been hearing that Iran is weeks away from nuclear weapon for at least 25 years. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6302.2s)]
*  Yes. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6307.639999999999s)]
*  Verbatim, at least a decade and for longer in substance, yes. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6308.84s)]
*  Is Iran weeks away from building a nuclear weapon? [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6313.24s)]
*  Does Iran want a nuclear weapon? [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6315.4s)]
*  Will Iran get a nuclear weapon? [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6317.5599999999995s)]
*  What is the truth about Iran? [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6319.4s)]
*  Iran does not want a nuclear weapon. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6322.12s)]
*  Iran's neighbors, like the Saudis and others in the Gulf, do not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6325.08s)]
*  Iran's major ally, Russia, does not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6331.08s)]
*  Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6336.92s)]
*  But Iran does not want to be defeated militarily by Israel, does not want to be bombed to hell [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6339.24s)]
*  by Israel, and does not want to be sanctioned to death economically by the United States, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6352.92s)]
*  which the US has been doing now for endless years. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6359.08s)]
*  So Iran has said for 10 years, 11 years, 12 years, unequivocally, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6364.68s)]
*  we don't want a nuclear weapon. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6372.76s)]
*  We want an agreement with you. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6375.96s)]
*  We want you to lift sanctions and we want a no nuclear system and with all [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6377.96s)]
*  verifications and monitoring and safety as well. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6386.76s)]
*  We want to have our nuclear power plants. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6392.44s)]
*  We want our own military. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6396.679999999999s)]
*  We're not going to disarm in a region where Israel attacks every country in the region. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6398.28s)]
*  And by the way, where we have other enemies as well. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6404.2s)]
*  So we are not going to unilaterally disarm in our region. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6407.0s)]
*  But we do not want a nuclear weapon. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6412.679999999999s)]
*  The truth is that has been known for a dozen years in detail at the highest levels. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6415.72s)]
*  So what's the problem? [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6426.28s)]
*  That seems like a pretty good basis for an agreement. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6427.400000000001s)]
*  There is no problem in reaching a sound agreement. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6432.84s)]
*  And by the way, with the nuclear power plants, which are in dozens of countries, [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6436.68s)]
*  the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency has successfully monitored and set up absolutely [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6444.04s)]
*  rigorous monitoring. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6457.32s)]
*  And Iran is open to that and has said so repeatedly and has said it would work with the neighbors [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6459.16s)]
*  on the fuel supply chains and all the rest. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6465.719999999999s)]
*  There is no obstacle to this. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6469.0s)]
*  And I think we're close to an agreement with Iran, in fact, thanks to President Trump, [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6472.44s)]
*  because Netanyahu says, no, we need to bomb the hell out of them. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6479.88s)]
*  We need to defeat them like we defeated Saddam and Assad and Gaddafi. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6487.24s)]
*  We need to take out this evil regime. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6492.28s)]
*  That's his line. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6495.4s)]
*  So it's not about nukes what you're saying. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6496.36s)]
*  You're saying it's not about nukes, it's about regime change. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6499.0s)]
*  I think for sure. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6501.0s)]
*  And that's been true all along. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6502.6s)]
*  So why not just say that? [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6505.16s)]
*  Why does Fox News tell me every single day? [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6506.36s)]
*  Not that I have a TV, but I hear. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6509.72s)]
*  Fox News is telling everyone every day, they're moments away from nuclear. [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6512.2s)]
*  We cannot allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6515.4s)]
*  Day after day after day. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6518.44s)]
*  Why not just say no? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6519.48s)]
*  By the way, that's true. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6520.44s)]
*  And Iran would agree with that. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6521.56s)]
*  Yes, that's what we're saying. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6524.36s)]
*  So if you went on television right now, if you were back on your old perch on Morning Joe, [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6525.8s)]
*  and you said, actually, Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon, [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6530.44s)]
*  they would accuse you immediately of being an agent of Iran. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6533.639999999999s)]
*  They might. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6537.879999999999s)]
*  Because maybe someone would tell them in their little earpiece to say that, [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6539.5599999999995s)]
*  because that's how it works. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6543.48s)]
*  But you're saying that's true. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6546.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you're acting like that's like a non-controversial statement. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6548.12s)]
*  No, Iran doesn't want a bomb. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6550.28s)]
*  They've said they don't. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6551.08s)]
*  They just don't want to get attacked. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6551.719999999999s)]
*  They have said for years, remove our sanctions, normalize relations, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6553.16s)]
*  stop trying to overthrow us, tell your bulldog Israel to stop threatening us with war, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6557.8s)]
*  and we can have perfectly normal relations, and we don't want a nuclear weapon. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6566.92s)]
*  It's a much bigger headache than we want. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6572.52s)]
*  We don't want it. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6575.4800000000005s)]
*  But that is not the story that any American news channel tells ever. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6576.360000000001s)]
*  I'm shocked. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6580.28s)]
*  We live in the world of narratives. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6583.320000000001s)]
*  You know, for many years, the Iranians were asking, [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6585.8s)]
*  how do we reach the Biden White House? [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6593.56s)]
*  How do we want to open up channels? [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6595.4800000000005s)]
*  We want to negotiate. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6597.88s)]
*  Of course, they wouldn't talk to them. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6599.0s)]
*  If it was, we know the president now, I mean, we knew then, but now it's confirmed. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6600.6s)]
*  President wasn't in any shape to talk to anybody. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6605.56s)]
*  And the administration was the biggest foreign policy failure of one can imagine. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6608.6s)]
*  But the Iranians have been saying all along, we want to negotiate. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6613.96s)]
*  And as soon as President Trump was elected, at least I got inquiries. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6620.44s)]
*  Do you know anyone in the White House? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6625.8s)]
*  Do you know anyone in the president's team? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6627.16s)]
*  How can we make contact? [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6628.68s)]
*  That's not the behavior you make if you're relentlessly trying to go to a nuclear bomb. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6630.76s)]
*  So what about the story that you hear endlessly that Iran is planning to [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6636.28s)]
*  nuke the United States if that's on their agenda? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6640.92s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6645.32s)]
*  So do you consider that like insane? [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6646.36s)]
*  I consider that so bewildering if a grownup says that we need to have a long, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6650.36s)]
*  hard talk about a lot of facts. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6659.16s)]
*  But that is simply the most absurd, imaginable idea. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6661.96s)]
*  Iran, by the way, is a civilization of, by usual count, 5200 years. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6669.320000000001s)]
*  Persia is the usual name given for Iran. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6678.360000000001s)]
*  Oldest continuous in the world. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6681.320000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's arguably the longest continuous civilization, though many jump up and say, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6683.080000000001s)]
*  no, we are maybe the Georgians say it or the Egyptians say it. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6689.320000000001s)]
*  So I won't get into arguments among my friends. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6692.280000000001s)]
*  Except this is actually a great civilization that has lasted for 5000 years. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6695.32s)]
*  They're not going to bring it to an end by bombing the United States and having [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6704.5199999999995s)]
*  Persia or Iran disappear from the world map, literally, physically, by atom by atom, [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6710.28s)]
*  by such an attack. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6717.96s)]
*  So why are we going through all this? [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6720.759999999999s)]
*  The full attention of huge parts of the US government, billions and billions and billions [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6723.0s)]
*  and trillions over the years of American tax dollars have gone to responding to this threat. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6728.2s)]
*  We have bases all around the region, all focused on Iran, which we maintain, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6733.24s)]
*  including a huge one in Qatar, etc. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6737.72s)]
*  All of this effort by the United States focused on this Iranian threat that you claim doesn't exist. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6740.76s)]
*  Remember that Iran was a first of all, Iran was a democratic country in 1953. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6746.2s)]
*  They the prime minister at the time named Mosaddegh had this absolutely outlandish idea, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6756.92s)]
*  which was that the oil under their ground belonged to Iranians. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6764.76s)]
*  This was a very weird idea because the British knew it belonged to the British. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6771.08s)]
*  The Americans expected that it belonged to the Americans in the new age. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6776.36s)]
*  And so CIA and MI6 overthrew the Iranian democracy. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6782.84s)]
*  Then we installed a police state known as the Shah of Iran and SAVAK, it's supposed intelligence [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6789.0s)]
*  and enforcement authority from 1953 to 1978 when the Shah was dying of cancer and he was a hated [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6800.68s)]
*  figure in Iran. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6819.4800000000005s)]
*  Jimmy Carter was talked into taking him into the United States and that provoked [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6821.56s)]
*  the reaction and the taking of hostages by American hostages in Iran. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6830.76s)]
*  The Iranian revolution was taken badly by the United States, but Iran had been our fortress. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6838.200000000001s)]
*  Why Iran? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6846.76s)]
*  Because this was part of our anti-Soviet effort, this was part of our Cold War effort. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6847.72s)]
*  Iran turned from a police state ally to America's foe and Israel's foe. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6854.360000000001s)]
*  By the way, in 1980, the United States and 1981 in particular, the United States armed Saddam [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6863.4800000000005s)]
*  Hussein massively to go kill Iranians. [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6873.56s)]
*  So we told Iraq, go invade Iran and we supported an absolutely bloody, [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6877.64s)]
*  disastrous war between Iraq and Iran. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6886.76s)]
*  We loved it. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6890.360000000001s)]
*  It was the two scorpions fighting in the bottle, killing each other. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6891.08s)]
*  Fought in part by children. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6894.200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, on the American dime. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6895.72s)]
*  So our position towards Iran has been an aggression since 1953, actually. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6900.52s)]
*  Remember, the American deep state doesn't care about any other people at all, whatever [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6910.68s)]
*  happens to them. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6917.88s)]
*  It doesn't care about the Ukrainian people. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6918.6s)]
*  It doesn't care about the people we're quote saving. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6921.56s)]
*  It cares about whatever fight it's in. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6924.76s)]
*  The fight might be against Russia, in which case the Ukrainians are used. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6927.56s)]
*  The fight might be for Israel, in which case some other jihadists are used, whatever. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6932.84s)]
*  The Kurds or whoever is convenient at the time. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6941.4800000000005s)]
*  So Iran is kind of amazingly incurring this for 75 years and for the last dozen years [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6945.8s)]
*  saying, peace, come on, make peace. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6961.88s)]
*  President Trump is close to it right now. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6965.240000000001s)]
*  Again, as in all the other cases we have been discussing, the deep state narrative is deep. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6968.6s)]
*  It's long standing. [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6978.12s)]
*  It's not shallow. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6979.8s)]
*  It's pretty much empty. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6981.72s)]
*  It's pretty much concocted, but it's deep. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6983.64s)]
*  And so in order to overcome the deep state, in this case, it's the Israel or Zionist lobby [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6987.0s)]
*  because it's got a pretty complicated domestic heritage and base. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=6994.2s)]
*  In order to overcome what has been 20 years of wars of choice in the Middle East and to stop them, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7000.599999999999s)]
*  it requires a lot of political capital and attention by President Trump. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7007.4s)]
*  Just like in Ukraine, he's absolutely on the right track. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7014.679999999999s)]
*  But he's getting attacked by everybody for being on the right track. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7019.4s)]
*  And he's trying to express America's real interest. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7024.599999999999s)]
*  America cannot have a war with Iran, by the way. [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7028.92s)]
*  It would lead to a regional war. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7034.599999999999s)]
*  It would be costly, bloody, threatening. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7038.12s)]
*  And on January 17th of this year, Iran signed a security agreement with Russia. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7042.36s)]
*  So it would just open up another front of potential nuclear war. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7050.12s)]
*  President Trump's smart. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7055.4s)]
*  He's trying to avoid this. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7057.0s)]
*  Everyone's shouting at him, don't avoid it, go to war. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7059.16s)]
*  And for the president to prevail, he has all the authority he needs. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7063.72s)]
*  But this noise is incessant. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7069.4s)]
*  And the arrogance of Lindsey Graham or the American Congress that thinks we can do whatever we want, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7073.72s)]
*  wherever we want and win whenever we want, when everything has been trillions of dollars of cost [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7082.84s)]
*  in one disaster after another, that arrogance actually continues until today. [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7088.68s)]
*  It's not fear, it's arrogance that's the fundamental driver. [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7093.96s)]
*  In the face of, I mean, they haven't won a war in 80 years. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7097.56s)]
*  So the US military is not going to war in 80 years. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7100.44s)]
*  So I'm not attacking anyone. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7103.16s)]
*  I say that with sadness, but I don't understand on what basis this optimism arises. [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7104.5199999999995s)]
*  The optimism is misplaced, let us say, because these people have gotten us into one debacle [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7110.04s)]
*  after another. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7117.879999999999s)]
*  And if, you know, when Lindsey, I'm going to pick on Lindsey Graham again, because he's been the [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7119.0s)]
*  biggest warmonger in the Senate, if when he speaks, if there were little logos on the screen, [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7123.96s)]
*  Iraq war supporter, this war, if people understood, okay, this guy's told you the wrong thing, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7132.12s)]
*  five wars in a row, then okay, then we let him speak and let everyone understand, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7138.84s)]
*  this guy gets it wrong every single time. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7146.04s)]
*  And that's true of most of these warmongers. [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7149.4s)]
*  But I think, you know, just to say, this will continue, unfortunately, as long as we don't [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7152.52s)]
*  have peace a little bit further to the west of Iran, and that is we need Israel and Palestine, [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7162.360000000001s)]
*  two states living in peace, and not this plan that is the clean break that is breaking us, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7172.200000000001s)]
*  that goes back 30 years. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7180.84s)]
*  In other words, the harder work even than avoiding the war with Iran is the United States [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7182.68s)]
*  finally telling Israel, come on, there's a limit, you reached it, you exceeded it. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7190.599999999999s)]
*  Those words need to be uttered. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7197.5599999999995s)]
*  And they haven't been uttered to this day, 53 million deaths of women and children and [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7199.5599999999995s)]
*  everyone else, the United States needs to say, you crossed the line. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7205.4s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Say that to the Prime Minister of Israel. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7210.2s)]
*  John Ligato Says that to the Israeli people [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7213.96s)]
*  and to the Prime Minister, we no longer support this. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7216.839999999999s)]
*  And that's hard in American politics. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7221.24s)]
*  Steve McLaughlin Why? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7223.879999999999s)]
*  John Ligato It's hard again, because the narrative for [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7224.2s)]
*  decades has been the opposite, because Americans don't understand how much we have paid for these [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7229.88s)]
*  terrible, absurd, deadly Israeli led or provoked or desired wars. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7240.6s)]
*  And because there are deep beliefs and misunderstandings about the region that [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7250.04s)]
*  are just reproduced and replicated over time. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7257.96s)]
*  Again, just like Iran, I deal every day with diplomats from around the world. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7263.16s)]
*  It's my privilege and good luck that I speak with leaders all over the Middle East, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7274.2s)]
*  for example, in Egypt, in Saudi, in Jordan, in Turkey, in Iran, [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7282.52s)]
*  all over the Middle East. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7295.320000000001s)]
*  They have said to me for years and years and years, [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7297.56s)]
*  if there is a state of Palestine alongside the state of Israel, we normalize relations with Israel, [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7302.76s)]
*  we, of course, support the mutual security of the two states, we do business, we do everything. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7311.88s)]
*  And they have said that not only privately to me at length explaining the situation, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7321.160000000001s)]
*  but publicly in what's called the Arab Peace Initiative, which goes back to 2002. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7325.96s)]
*  So it's been 23 years where the Arab states have been saying clearly, [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7331.72s)]
*  when Israel says there's no one to talk to, there's everyone to talk to. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7337.879999999999s)]
*  Everyone wants peace, quiet and economic development. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7342.599999999999s)]
*  Believe it or not, they want to live their lives. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7348.04s)]
*  They want their children to grow up. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7351.32s)]
*  They actually want to have building, construction. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7353.719999999999s)]
*  They're worried about their physical lives, their jobs, everything. [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7357.799999999999s)]
*  And they want peace. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7363.799999999999s)]
*  And they want peace. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7365.4s)]
*  And they know that there can't be economic development unless there's peace. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7366.679999999999s)]
*  So if you ask why is it, there is no deep reason why there isn't two states living peacefully [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7371.639999999999s)]
*  side by side. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7380.44s)]
*  The idea that Hamas, Hamas, this is a narrative, this is a gimmick, this is a lie. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7381.96s)]
*  Hamas would go the first day if the United States said, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7388.68s)]
*  yes, we support a Palestinian state, but it's got to be peaceful. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7395.32s)]
*  It's got to be disarmed. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7399.08s)]
*  That's fine. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7400.44s)]
*  Everyone agrees with this. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7401.4800000000005s)]
*  No one disagrees with this. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7403.0s)]
*  But what we don't hear and get an explanation of, and this is what people need to understand, [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7404.84s)]
*  Netanyahu is completely uninterested in that. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7412.36s)]
*  Totally, totally uninterested in that. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7415.24s)]
*  He doesn't say, oh, we need to defeat Hamas. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7418.76s)]
*  Then there can be a Palestinian state. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7422.36s)]
*  No, of course not, because that's fundamentally not the idea. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7424.76s)]
*  Fundamentally, the idea is we defeat Hamas. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7429.24s)]
*  We rule. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7433.24s)]
*  Of course we rule. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7434.599999999999s)]
*  This is ours. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7435.88s)]
*  But the problem is, leaving aside who's right, who's wrong, philosophical and moral [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7436.92s)]
*  justifications for this or that policy, you have millions of people living there. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7441.96s)]
*  That's the point, exactly. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7446.68s)]
*  As a practical matter, what do you do with them? [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7448.68s)]
*  People get caught up in 1947 and settlers from Eastern Europe that are mad about this. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7452.84s)]
*  You could ignore all history and just pretend the world started January 1st, 2025, and you've got [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7459.4s)]
*  millions of people living there. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7466.52s)]
*  What are you going to do with them? [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7468.04s)]
*  I don't understand. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7469.16s)]
*  You are so correct. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7470.04s)]
*  There are 8 million Jews. [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7472.36s)]
*  There are 8 million Palestinian Arabs. [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7474.68s)]
*  What's the plan? [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7476.68s)]
*  I just wonder what the plan is. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7477.48s)]
*  The plan. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7479.48s)]
*  You can't get to the plan. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7480.5199999999995s)]
*  The second you ask, it's like, oh, you're working for Qatar. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7481.32s)]
*  The answer is simple. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7483.32s)]
*  The plan is something else. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7485.0s)]
*  The answer is simple. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7486.68s)]
*  Two places, one for the Palestinians, one for the Israelis. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7488.92s)]
*  That's simple. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7492.92s)]
*  And it's not even hard. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7493.96s)]
*  I've had generals from Israel recently telling me, [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7496.12s)]
*  no, it's not even a security issue. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7499.16s)]
*  And here's how the borders go and all the rest. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7501.08s)]
*  The plan is how do you overcome the remaining US complete intransigence on this? [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7504.68s)]
*  That's the issue. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7515.8s)]
*  But why do we care? [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7517.16s)]
*  It's in our interest. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7518.28s)]
*  That's what's confusing. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7519.4s)]
*  We don't have an inherent national interest there. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7520.599999999999s)]
*  There's no oil there, for example. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7522.84s)]
*  It's not like it's an energy concern for us. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7524.44s)]
*  So why do we care? [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7527.8s)]
*  And what are the options? [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7529.32s)]
*  What do you do with 8 million people? [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7530.76s)]
*  You can't send them somewhere? [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7532.36s)]
*  Like, I don't like what do they think? [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7534.5199999999995s)]
*  You said the magic word, and I hope that President Trump gets this because it's his core philosophy. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7536.36s)]
*  Peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians is America's interest. [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7546.36s)]
*  Again, not even on moral grounds, just the most practical ground. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7552.84s)]
*  Keep us out of nuclear war. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7557.32s)]
*  Keep us out of regional war. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7559.08s)]
*  Have economic development. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7562.2s)]
*  Build. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7564.2s)]
*  Have business. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7564.679999999999s)]
*  Everything. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7565.719999999999s)]
*  No more 9-11s. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7566.36s)]
*  Have normalizations. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7567.4s)]
*  Osama bin Laden said that he planned 9-11 in part because of what was happening [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7568.679999999999s)]
*  between Israel and the Palestinians and America's support for Israel. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7574.599999999999s)]
*  Now, no one wanted to hear that. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7578.12s)]
*  That's called you names if you said it. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7579.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not on Osama bin Laden's side, obviously. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7581.5599999999995s)]
*  I totally disagree with Osama bin Laden, but that's a fact. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7584.44s)]
*  So why would we want to expose ourselves to more of that? [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7588.599999999999s)]
*  Why don't we try and get this fixed? [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7591.88s)]
*  This is the key to every issue we're talking about. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7593.24s)]
*  What is America's national interest in the context of Ukraine and Russia? [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7597.24s)]
*  Is it for Ukraine to be blowing up Russian strategic bombers, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7604.599999999999s)]
*  or is it for Ukraine to be a neutral country without NATO? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7610.92s)]
*  It's the second. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7615.0s)]
*  What is America's national interest vis-a-vis Iran? [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7616.68s)]
*  It is no nuclear weapons in Iran and peace, no war. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7621.64s)]
*  What is America's interest in Israel and Palestine? [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7627.16s)]
*  It is 8 million Palestinians for Palestine and 8 million Israelis living in Israel in peace. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7631.96s)]
*  And please, if I could say it this way, shut up a little bit. [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7639.64s)]
*  No more wars that we're dragged into. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7643.8s)]
*  You guys just live. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7646.6s)]
*  That's America's real interest. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7648.12s)]
*  So if the president follows through on America's national interest, [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7651.0s)]
*  not on the grandiosity that we can do anything we want anywhere we want, [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7656.68s)]
*  because we are the United States of America and our mission is to defeat Russia, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7662.76s)]
*  or our mission is to defeat Iran, or our mission is greater Israel, [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7668.44s)]
*  if we follow the American national interest, it's absolutely straightforward what to do. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7673.16s)]
*  It is no war with Iran and negotiated treaty. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7681.08s)]
*  It is two states, Israel and Palestine. [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7684.12s)]
*  It is a neutral Ukraine. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7687.16s)]
*  President Trump has all of that close, close at hand. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7689.639999999999s)]
*  But everyone requires his attention. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7694.92s)]
*  This is hard because every one of them confronts a narrative that's 30 years old or 50 years old, [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7699.400000000001s)]
*  that is deeply entrenched, that is fundamentally based on the premise [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7710.84s)]
*  that America can do what it wants anywhere in the world because it's all power. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7718.2s)]
*  Because it's all powerful. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7723.64s)]
*  At the core of everything, Tucker, is a kind of arrogance of power that has been proved to be wrong [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7725.88s)]
*  from Vietnam, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Iraq. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7734.6s)]
*  It's not that we're hopeless and helpless and I'm not defeatist in that way. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7746.52s)]
*  I'm saying that if you choose the wrong battles, you can't win those battles. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7753.4800000000005s)]
*  Right, that's exactly right. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7760.84s)]
*  If you choose battles that are not in America's interest, you'll go away because they're not. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7761.24s)]
*  Afghanistan wasn't fundamentally in America's interest, [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7767.08s)]
*  or Iraq wasn't fundamentally in America's interest, [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7770.360000000001s)]
*  or Ukraine wasn't fundamentally in America's interest. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7773.0s)]
*  And by the way, that's also not isolationism. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7776.4400000000005s)]
*  That's just being smart, prudent, normal, and also recognizing, don't be so afraid. [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7779.4s)]
*  Our only risk in the United States, honestly, now we know it's not the UFOs, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7787.719999999999s)]
*  that was a concocted thing of the Air Force, our only risk is a nuclear war. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7793.96s)]
*  Stay clear of a nuclear war. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7801.5599999999995s)]
*  Please stay clear of these ultimate confrontations. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7803.5599999999995s)]
*  Don't fight Russia to the end. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7807.8s)]
*  It's a great power. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7810.84s)]
*  You can live side by side with it. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7811.96s)]
*  Same with China. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7814.12s)]
*  Come on, just be normal and we can have secure, prosperous lives for all of us. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7815.4800000000005s)]
*  When you overstate your power, your power evaporates. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7821.400000000001s)]
*  The US is so much less powerful than it was before the invasion of Afghanistan. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7824.84s)]
*  We are at so much more risk objectively than we were before. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7828.68s)]
*  Anyone that measures risk, I often refer to this doomsday clock of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7833.64s)]
*  which says we're closer to nuclear armageddon than ever before in human history. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7839.96s)]
*  This is crazy. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7844.12s)]
*  We should be as far away. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7845.24s)]
*  I was there, as I said, in the Kremlin in December 1991. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7847.5599999999995s)]
*  The doomsday clock was 17 minutes away from midnight because we have peace. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7852.76s)]
*  Now we're 89 seconds to midnight. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7859.4s)]
*  Are you kidding? [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7861.88s)]
*  How did we squander this? [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7862.68s)]
*  Because we did so many Israeli-provoked wars because we had to expand NATO to Russia's border, [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7864.68s)]
*  blah, blah, blah. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7873.0s)]
*  None of this is for America's interest. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7874.280000000001s)]
*  And it's objectively the case. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7876.6s)]
*  Let me ask you one last question. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7878.68s)]
*  You said that most of the storylines, the narratives, are 30 years old. [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7880.200000000001s)]
*  And I think that's exactly right. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7884.200000000001s)]
*  It does feel like it could be 1995 again. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7885.400000000001s)]
*  But there is one new one, and that is that Qatar, Qatar, Q-A-T-A-R, very small Gulf state, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7889.96s)]
*  wholly within Saudi, I think the largest natural gas field in the world, biggest American air base [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7897.96s)]
*  in the region, that that country is like a powerful enemy of the United States and is [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7903.72s)]
*  controlling America's media, controlling America's higher education system, and that most bad things [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7910.52s)]
*  most bad things and all bad opinions come from Qatar and Qatari propaganda. [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7917.0s)]
*  Are you familiar with this argument? [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7923.32s)]
*  Not quite, but I am familiar with Qatar. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7926.84s)]
*  Yeah. So what do you assess Qatar's role in the United States? [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7929.4800000000005s)]
*  Are they controlling our media, do you think? [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7935.64s)]
*  I don't lose sleep over it. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7937.88s)]
*  To tell you the truth, I haven't heard it put exactly that way. [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7941.08s)]
*  You've got to get on the internet more. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7946.04s)]
*  I know. I've been going to Qatar for a while. [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7947.4800000000005s)]
*  They gave the president a nice plane, and it's not a danger to the American people. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7951.4800000000005s)]
*  If we were to calm down a little bit, we actually could have all the safety in the world we want. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7959.72s)]
*  This is actually the truth. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7967.08s)]
*  If we drop our angst on big bad Russia, actually we didn't have a chance to talk about it this time, [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7972.120000000001s)]
*  maybe another time, big bad China, which is also not going to invade the United States, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7980.92s)]
*  not going to threaten us, not going to go to war with us. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7986.84s)]
*  They got their trying to deal with aging and they've got their declining population and many [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7990.04s)]
*  other things, not that they're falling apart. It's a very impressive civilization, but [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=7995.56s)]
*  they're not a threat to the United States, honestly, and Iran is not a threat. [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8001.4800000000005s)]
*  Now I'll add another country that's not a threat, Qatar. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8005.64s)]
*  By the way, there are 193 UN member states, and I would say 192 of them are not threats [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8010.120000000001s)]
*  to the United States if we just behave with some prudence and don't get ourselves [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8017.88s)]
*  edging towards the nuclear war. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8025.24s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs, thank you very much. [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8027.96s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8030.36s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising, [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8036.679999999999s)]
*  that's what they do, but on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8041.5599999999995s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8045.32s)]
*  on the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8050.44s)]
*  rather than more. That is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8055.639999999999s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8061.96s)]
*  or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8065.48s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8070.12s)]
*  it's to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8073.879999999999s)]
*  and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8079.48s)]
*  actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=677g2SsetMs&t=8083.959999999999s)]
