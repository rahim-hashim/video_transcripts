# Chamath Palihapitiya: Zuckerberg, Rogan, Musk, and the Incoming “Golden Age” Under Trump
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE)
*  2020 was like an incredibly prolific period for me. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, I'd wake up out of bed and I was doing deals and it was like the... [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4.0s)]
*  I had the world in my... in the palm of my hand, it felt like. I was, you know, moving markets [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=11.84s)]
*  every time I communicated publicly. That was incredibly dizzying and it had the exact opposite [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  effect on me that it should have. What it should have done, I should have taken a step back and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=24.48s)]
*  say, hold on, this has nothing to do with me. What is this moment? And the moment would have been [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=29.68s)]
*  we're at the tail end of zero rates. We had trillions of dollars that the government had [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=35.12s)]
*  basically given to individuals. We had an enormous M2 money supply and instead I thought it was me. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=39.36s)]
*  And then in, you know, 2022 when the war in Ukraine started, the bottom fell out in financially in [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=47.68s)]
*  Silicon Valley and frankly a lot of things that I was working on. It was such a wake-up call and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=56.16s)]
*  it was the biggest blessing of my life. You know, I never thought I would be in a position to have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=61.28s)]
*  made that much money. In hindsight, I've never been more blessed than to torch, you know, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=66.0s)]
*  three or four billion dollars. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=70.96s)]
*  Do you think, I mean, there's, you know, we're still, it's still ongoing, the war in Ukraine, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=86.08s)]
*  but it had, you said, an immediate effect on markets. It was, it was like a pivot point. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=98.56s)]
*  You could point, you could put it on a map, March of 2022, I'll never forget it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=104.16s)]
*  So that war, my opinion, was, you know, welcomed by many in the West. And I wonder if, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=108.8s)]
*  whatever they said, it was clear they were for it. Do you think that those two things are connected? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=119.36s)]
*  It's not clear to me how connected they are, but the first part of what you said I do agree with, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=127.12s)]
*  which is that we have silently allowed this insidious war machine to take over [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=130.96s)]
*  large parts of the government. And what's so interesting about this is that it actually, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=137.04s)]
*  I would have said, was more riddled inside the Republican Party. But it turns out over these [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=143.12s)]
*  last few years, especially since this MAGA takeover, this hostile takeover that Donald Trump [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  affected, which I think is enormously important in historical context, but it's more within the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Party now. There are these neocon warmongers that want to connect the dots between [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=161.76s)]
*  people suffering and their own economic opportunity. And I think that that's very [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=168.88s)]
*  scary. And I think that whenever you see that, you have to push against that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=174.16s)]
*  Humans should not be at war. We should not be fighting and killing each other. It's just a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=178.56s)]
*  simple foundational moral principle that I think we all have to live by. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=186.39999999999998s)]
*  You just cannot go there. And you have to push back on every avenue of people that try to take [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=190.24s)]
*  you there. I couldn't agree more. Sorry to derail what you were saying. It was very interesting. So [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=196.96s)]
*  2020, everything you touch seems to turn a profit. Two years later, everything changes. Why is that [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=203.68s)]
*  good for you, losing all the money or all that money? Because I had to take a step back and [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=211.76s)]
*  actually figure out how much of this was actually me and my preparation and my process or [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=217.6s)]
*  my dark passenger. And here's what I mean by this, because I thought about this a lot. I think we all [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=227.2s)]
*  have a dark passenger. So when you are born, you're kind of like this body that has the capability to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  do anything. I mean, we talk about this, but we don't say it enough, but the genetic diversity [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=241.2s)]
*  of all humanity is minuscule. So I think I interpret that as the capability of all humanity [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=246.72s)]
*  is pretty incredible, but you have this huge distribution of outcomes. And part of that are [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=254.08s)]
*  the things that happen to you as you're growing up, right? Your lived experience, right? It's the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=260.24s)]
*  nature part, not the nurture necessarily. And nature gives some people a very dark passenger, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=265.28s)]
*  right? Some of them will then commit crimes. Some of them will become murderers. Some of them will [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=273.44s)]
*  become drug addicts. Some of them will have this litany of things happen to them. In my case, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=277.12s)]
*  my lived experience gave me this thing where I have always battled this insecurity that I've [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=283.2s)]
*  just felt I'm basically worthless. You're a kid, you come here, you don't really fit in. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=288.48s)]
*  You try to kind of make a social life out of everything else that you're supposed to do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  Doesn't really work, right? And so that creates a chip on my shoulder. And it was this sort of [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=303.76s)]
*  thing where I always felt that was on the outside looking in. And then when I worked at Facebook [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=308.47999999999996s)]
*  and then left, and all of a sudden in my early thirties, I had more success and more money, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=315.52s)]
*  to be honest, than I ever thought I would have. I spent a lot of time, a decade basically, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=322.16s)]
*  feeding that insecurity, buying things, accumulating things. And to be honest with [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=327.68s)]
*  you, if I'm being really honest with myself, look, I built a really successful investment [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=333.36s)]
*  business by all numerical accounts, but I would say for me, it was a lost decade. I didn't do [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  anything. And I got to a point in 2022 where all of that stuff, so much of it had to be stripped [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=342.32s)]
*  away and I had to look at what was left and rebuild from fundamentals. I had an incredible wife. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=348.08s)]
*  What a blessing. That's for sure. I had incredible kids. What a blessing. Five. Five incredible kids. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=351.68s)]
*  That's amazing. It's incredible. It's incredible. I mean, I think I'm a little bit [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=357.12s)]
*  you. It's amazing. Having kids is amazing. I had incredible friends. I have a Thursday night poker [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=360.8s)]
*  game that I will frankly, no matter where I am in the world, I will go out of my way, planes, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=379.92s)]
*  trains and automobiles to fly back for, because of what that game gives me with my friends. So [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=385.68s)]
*  So I have these little things. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=390.32s)]
*  Where's the game? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=391.71999999999997s)]
*  In my house. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=392.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=393.88s)]
*  Yeah, and it's great too, because by the way, like, you know, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=394.4s)]
*  How many players? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=396.32s)]
*  Well, so poker, so in Silicon Valley, there's like a group of us, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=397.2s)]
*  like some well-known folks that we all get together. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=400.24s)]
*  And my wife was the one that did this. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=403.71999999999997s)]
*  She when she first looked at the game, you'd see all these people [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=405.76s)]
*  and it was really interesting. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=409.44s)]
*  But, you know, a lot of my friends have a touch of the tism. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=411.32s)]
*  And so what happens is, you know, you just end up like looking down [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=413.8s)]
*  at your cards for eight hours straight. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=416.71999999999997s)]
*  Nothing was happening. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=418.52s)]
*  And she said, guys, this is ridiculous. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=419.28s)]
*  You can play for a few hours, but at 7 p.m., we're going to break for dinner. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=421.4s)]
*  We're going to sit around a table and we're all going to talk. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=425.88s)]
*  And you must look at each other in the eyes. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=427.91999999999996s)]
*  And it was so funny. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=429.84s)]
*  But it's become a ritual. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=431.88s)]
*  And for all of us, we all feel seen. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=434.08s)]
*  And then slowly what happens is people start to talk about things [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=436.11999999999995s)]
*  that they would have never talked about. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=438.76s)]
*  And what you see is this repetitive pattern. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=440.2s)]
*  People with this dark passenger, lots of insecurity. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=443.52s)]
*  They achieve a lot. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=447.8s)]
*  But all of that a lot is externally validated, but not internally felt. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  And so there's just this sense that there's an emptiness. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=457.0s)]
*  And people start to panic. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  I thought that XYZ would solve the problem. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=462.32s)]
*  I thought the watches would solve the problem. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=464.68s)]
*  The boat, the plane, the clothes, the chains. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=466.76s)]
*  None of it solves it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=470.44s)]
*  And everybody, like clockwork, all of my friends go through it. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=472.44s)]
*  And so it's funny, I'm sort of at the tail end of this. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=476.88s)]
*  But that poker game has been almost like this therapy session [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=479.76s)]
*  where we all get to talk. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=482.4s)]
*  And then as a result, people feel calmer. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=484.08s)]
*  They feel a little bit more seen about what's going on. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=486.68s)]
*  My point in telling you this is not sympathy. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=489.04s)]
*  It's just a state that everybody is going through this struggle. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=491.44s)]
*  So back to me, I was able to sort of put a finger on what my thing is. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=495.32s)]
*  What is that big sack that I've been trying to carry up a hill [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=499.96s)]
*  that is totally worthless and not worth my time? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=505.28000000000003s)]
*  It's this idea that I am worthless and I'm not worth anybody's time. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=508.24s)]
*  And that just comes from the way that I was raised [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=512.28s)]
*  and the things that happened to me. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't want any sympathy for that except to say that's my thing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=517.16s)]
*  But now that I know it, I can try to do things that are more productive [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=520.04s)]
*  in ways where I feel real value. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  And I think that's a very useful process because it reintroduces... [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=527.16s)]
*  I think it can fix for so many people [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=531.84s)]
*  the thing that is so broken right now. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=534.6s)]
*  You know, we are completely de-spiritualized. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  Nobody believes in a higher order, faith, God. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=540.44s)]
*  And so I think what happens is everybody has this Carl Jung moment. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=545.52s)]
*  All of this difficulty sits on top of them. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=551.08s)]
*  And at some point, they may never say it out loud. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=554.12s)]
*  They think, I am living in a tale told by an idiot. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=555.88s)]
*  Right? That's that famous quote about why spirituality is important. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=559.36s)]
*  And when you feel that way and you don't have an answer, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=563.44s)]
*  you start to feel angry and you start to push back [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=567.08s)]
*  and you start to think, tear it all down. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=570.24s)]
*  None of this is working. It's all BS. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=571.84s)]
*  So I want to try to solve it for myself. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=575.6s)]
*  And then as I live and as I just kind of do the things that I'm doing, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  start new businesses, make new investments, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=581.36s)]
*  I want to try to point this out because I think by pointing it out, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=584.5600000000001s)]
*  you have a chance for other people to start questioning things. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  Do I have a dark passenger? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=592.32s)]
*  How did you get so self-aware about all of this? [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=593.6s)]
*  Most people, when they feel sad to sort of bumble forward [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=596.6s)]
*  and keep doing what they have always been doing to no effect, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=599.6s)]
*  what stopped you and made you think about what was happening? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=603.7600000000001s)]
*  You know, I am... [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=606.84s)]
*  It's still very much a source of anger for me. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=611.36s)]
*  Like, this idea that I'm basically worthless makes me mad. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=613.2800000000001s)]
*  And I projected it for many years sort of on the people that I, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=620.48s)]
*  you know, my parents for the most part, and all that dysfunction. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=625.5600000000001s)]
*  Because I think about it a lot. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  And then when I make mistakes, so in that 2022 period, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=633.0s)]
*  when I started to really write down, here are all the mistakes I made, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=636.0s)]
*  one or two layers... [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=640.04s)]
*  You actually wrote them down. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=641.04s)]
*  Wrote them down. It's like, OK, I invested a couple hundred million dollars [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  in this thing. It went to zero. What was I thinking? [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=645.12s)]
*  And I would first... In your mind is very clever. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=650.32s)]
*  At first, you lie to yourself and you lie to yourself incredibly well. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=653.6800000000001s)]
*  Well, I underwrote it this way. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=657.88s)]
*  I thought the discounted cash flows were... It's all BS. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=659.6800000000001s)]
*  One layer after that was, and then I communicated my thinking [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=664.6400000000001s)]
*  to hold myself accountable. Also BS. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=667.96s)]
*  That communication got me attention and I liked the way it made me feel. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=671.96s)]
*  And then I said, hold on a second. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=677.8s)]
*  That feels true. I hate that I can even say it, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=680.96s)]
*  that it may be true, but that feels true. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  And so then I go back and I start to think, like, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=688.64s)]
*  how many other decisions that I made, that I made in that period, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=690.56s)]
*  were rooted in that? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=693.6s)]
*  And when I saw four or five of them, I said, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=695.4s)]
*  this is not what I'm supposed to be doing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=699.08s)]
*  And then I went back and I said, how many other decisions in my life [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=702.28s)]
*  have I been making that were rooted in the idea of look at me? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=704.72s)]
*  And it turned out that there were a lot. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=710.6s)]
*  The things I bought, the clothes I wore, the things I said, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=712.24s)]
*  the way that I tried to live a life. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=716.0s)]
*  And I felt that that was not me. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=718.84s)]
*  I was ashamed of it. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=720.88s)]
*  Then I was angry about it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=723.4s)]
*  And then I asked my wife, I need you to help me fix it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  And this is what I mean by like, you have to have a partner, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=728.12s)]
*  I think, in crime that can really go through the ups and downs with you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=730.5999999999999s)]
*  Damn, what did your wife say when you told her this? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=735.0s)]
*  She's like, I've been telling you this for a year. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  What every wife says. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=739.9599999999999s)]
*  But, you know, I was like, finally, I listened. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=740.92s)]
*  And, you know, she always makes this joke. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=743.5999999999999s)]
*  She's like, I could tell you the smartest thing in the world. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  And she's like, you think you need a man to tell you. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=747.0s)]
*  And I said, well, this time, this man was me. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=748.64s)]
*  And it's a joke that we know it's true, though. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=750.64s)]
*  And so and my father-in-law and my father-in-law, when I finally, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=753.16s)]
*  like, kind of got rid of all the anger that I had, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=757.6s)]
*  my father-in-law was a father that I wish I had had. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=762.4s)]
*  And what I mean by this is like, some people may not understand this, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=767.16s)]
*  Tucker, you may not, you may or may not. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=771.2s)]
*  It is extremely discomforting to feel [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=774.12s)]
*  unconditional love from the people around you if you have not felt it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=779.84s)]
*  If you have always felt it, you don't know what it means [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=785.0s)]
*  when somebody says it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=787.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=788.84s)]
*  You're like, what does that mean? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=789.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=790.6800000000001s)]
*  I knew what it did not what what I thought love looked like. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=792.28s)]
*  And then when you have people that love you in this way, it's tilting. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  And it made me angry. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=803.2s)]
*  Because I would go back to this, I would push back on this, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=806.12s)]
*  and I would go back to that and say, why didn't that look like this? [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=809.44s)]
*  And I was just I was in an endless loop of just being there. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=812.96s)]
*  So when you experienced the way your wife's family loved each other, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=816.0s)]
*  it made you mad about your childhood? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=819.68s)]
*  Yeah. And at first, I was mad at her, meaning subconsciously. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=821.32s)]
*  Because she's giving me something that I don't understand. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=826.8s)]
*  And I thought, there's got to be a catch. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=829.96s)]
*  Where's the asterisks? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=832.12s)]
*  There's always a catch. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=833.96s)]
*  And for years, she's like, there's no catch. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=835.92s)]
*  And then she says to me, this is the best thing that's ever happened to us. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=840.48s)]
*  She's like, now, this next phase of totally building will be that you and I do it together. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=844.16s)]
*  And again, I freaked out. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=850.04s)]
*  And I thought, what do you mean? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=851.92s)]
*  Where do you find this woman? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=853.12s)]
*  Oh, my God. She's I mean, she's from the heavens. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=854.24s)]
*  She turns out she's from Milan, but she's from the heavens. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=857.88s)]
*  And and she's like, but we'll do it together. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=861.7199999999999s)]
*  And it's going to be incredible, whatever it is, because we're going to look back. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=864.64s)]
*  And the process will have been the thing. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=867.36s)]
*  So I just I needed a guide and I needed to be open to listening. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=871.24s)]
*  And so I needed that event. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=877.32s)]
*  Because you think about a kid, me. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=879.5600000000001s)]
*  I grew up in Sri Lanka. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=883.2s)]
*  There's a civil war. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=884.72s)]
*  We claim refugee status in Canada. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=886.52s)]
*  Grew up on welfare. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=889.32s)]
*  I get an engineering degree. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=891.16s)]
*  And within a year, I'm in the United States. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=892.5600000000001s)]
*  And my career just goes up and to the right. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=894.36s)]
*  Everything was working. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=897.44s)]
*  Youngest vice president at AOL, you know, when I was 26 years old, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  running this big messaging business. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=903.04s)]
*  Then I get recruited by Zuck. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=905.16s)]
*  I go to Facebook as one of the early execs. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=906.88s)]
*  I build that business. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=909.4799999999999s)]
*  All the key things that they look back on now, the network effects, the early [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=910.52s)]
*  monetization, internationalization. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=914.0s)]
*  That was my team. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=916.28s)]
*  Most of my team still runs that company. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=918.0799999999999s)]
*  So it was like. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=920.0s)]
*  Then I left and I started an investment business. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=921.88s)]
*  Those investment returns are really good. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=924.5999999999999s)]
*  So everything was quote unquote working. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=929.04s)]
*  So I held myself in really high regard, but for the wrong things. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=931.76s)]
*  If that makes sense. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=936.9599999999999s)]
*  Of course it does. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=937.68s)]
*  I could point to a bank account or Twitter followers or all of this stuff. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=938.28s)]
*  And then when that was undone. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=943.04s)]
*  Right. 2022, 2023, what happened? [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=947.7199999999999s)]
*  I thought that this was all supposed to work and it would work forever. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=951.92s)]
*  It was an opportunity for me to really reset and tell myself the truth. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  The ugly truth. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=958.16s)]

*  If that makes sense. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1030.92s)]
*  Meaning there were all these decisions that he made that I would reductively [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1031.72s)]

*  And it had nothing to do with business. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1039.76s)]
*  He had he was always leading from what are my what are my core moral beliefs and [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1041.3999999999999s)]
*  let me act on those. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1046.04s)]
*  Like the money never mattered. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1048.32s)]
*  You know, he never did anything to to to live that experience. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1050.24s)]
*  He loves his friends. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1054.8799999999999s)]

*  It took me a decade of knowing him until I started to listen to that and to like to [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1058.6399999999999s)]
*  really hone in on that. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1062.52s)]
*  So he's an example. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1063.4799999999998s)]
*  Then there are folks that are a little bit older that have gone through it. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1065.28s)]
*  My father-in-law has gone through it ups and downs and ups and downs. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1067.9199999999998s)]

*  And he's had to face tremendous hardship where he's had to underwrite what is [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1074.0s)]
*  really important. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1078.2800000000002s)]

*  And before I chose not to listen because my ego said, Hey man, you're, you know, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1109.2399999999998s)]

*  If you're not doing anything wrong, why do you care if other people watch what [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1116.76s)]

*  No privacy, no freedom. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1124.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, it's true that a VPN could come in handy for those who spend their time [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1127.52s)]
*  browsing the dark web, doing scandalous things. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1130.72s)]

*  Everything you do online can be seen by them and then sold by them. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1155.4s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1191.88s)]
*  That itself is weird. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1193.2s)]
*  It's really... [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1194.72s)]
*  I mean, it's not weird where you live. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1195.28s)]
*  It's not uncommon where you live. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1196.52s)]
*  But it's historically, like, there's not a lot of that. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1198.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1201.64s)]

*  The downside is if you don't know what those things that you care about really are, you're [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1213.96s)]

*  Good point. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1219.2s)]
*  What did you do when... [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1220.1599999999999s)]
*  This is after the Facebook IPO. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1222.72s)]
*  I mean, I bought a piece of the Warriors. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1224.08s)]
*  That was really cool. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1225.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, I was like a 10% owner of the Warriors. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1226.96s)]
*  I had a press release from the NBA. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1229.8s)]
*  And there was like two players on the team at the time that were older than me. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1232.88s)]
*  That's pretty weird. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1238.6000000000001s)]
*  And I made some amazing friendships with them. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1239.8400000000001s)]
*  When we won the championships, we would go to Vegas. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1242.24s)]
*  We would kind of like party together. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1244.7600000000002s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, like an incredible experience, especially for an ugly nerd that had no social [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1247.96s)]
*  life. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1254.5200000000002s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1255.0s)]
*  So I took advantage of that because it's like filling a jug of water, right? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1256.24s)]
*  That jug had always been empty. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1262.88s)]
*  I was never invited out, right? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1264.8s)]
*  So, OK, I thought, now I'm invited out. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1266.36s)]
*  Obviously, it's because, you know, the position is not like, you know, we grew up together [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1268.88s)]
*  or whatever, but I would get invited out. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1273.0s)]
*  OK, so every now and then, maybe more often than not, I'd just pay for the dinner. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1275.52s)]
*  Whatever, it doesn't matter. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1278.56s)]
*  I'm out. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1279.44s)]
*  I'm in the mix. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1280.6s)]
*  I'm in the game. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1281.16s)]
*  But then the jug fills up. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1282.24s)]
*  And then you're like, wait a minute, because you think like when the jug is two thirds full, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1285.44s)]
*  oh, don't worry, it's that extra third that's just going to fix it all. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1288.56s)]
*  It's true. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1292.16s)]
*  So you just go through these cycles. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1293.0s)]
*  And so, I mean, that was a cool thing. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1295.88s)]
*  You know, you do the you go after material possessions that doesn't do anything. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1297.92s)]
*  It really doesn't. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1303.4s)]
*  These are all very hollowing things. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1305.32s)]
*  I think like the thing that, like I said, like, you know, the problem with things like [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1306.72s)]
*  social media, what they do is they glorify these things. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1311.16s)]
*  We all fall for it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1314.16s)]
*  I fell for it. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1314.96s)]
*  So if when you have money, you go and you buy these things because you think this is [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1315.64s)]
*  what happiness looks like or, you know, success looks like. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1319.16s)]
*  And it's not it's none of that stuff. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1323.3600000000001s)]
*  Now, nobody listening to this. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1325.16s)]
*  We'll believe it because they all everybody wants to live that over and over because it's [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1329.72s)]
*  not like a very destructive life lesson. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1334.0800000000002s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1337.0s)]
*  I wouldn't like to have like a Laura Piano sweater and not need it. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1337.6s)]
*  But but the bigger message is more important, which is if you have a sense of what's [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1341.28s)]
*  important, you can kind of see the things that are really happening in a much more. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1347.3999999999999s)]
*  They're more in focus. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1354.08s)]
*  So, like, you know, I would say, like now that I'm 48, I'm much more aware of like, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1356.1599999999999s)]
*  what does it mean to be an American? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1361.96s)]
*  What is my job as an American businessman? [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1363.6s)]
*  As an engineer, as an entrepreneur, it's not all of this other superficial garbage [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1368.12s)]
*  because it adds nothing. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1375.1599999999999s)]
*  It's to actually allow the system that rewarded and benefited me to be just a little [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1377.56s)]
*  bit better in terms of the contributions I give to it before I'm no longer part of the [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1384.0s)]
*  system in 50 or 60 years. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1389.3999999999999s)]
*  That's very motivating for me now. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1392.08s)]
*  And this idea that my kids can go and join Team America and do cool stuff and find [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1394.6799999999998s)]
*  happiness, find a great husband, find a great wife, have a bunch of kids and live a good [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1400.6399999999999s)]
*  life and know what their dad went through and have a better sense of that. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1405.9199999999998s)]
*  That seems like an additive thing I can add to the system to be a good example for my [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1412.0s)]
*  friends when they start to go through their own struggles. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1416.24s)]
*  That they can kind of course correct a little bit faster than I did. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1420.56s)]
*  I mean, I went through a divorce, right? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1423.36s)]
*  So that's a terrible thing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1424.52s)]
*  After you got rich? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1426.76s)]
*  Yeah, after all that, I went through a divorce. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1428.1999999999998s)]
*  I was very lucky to find my wife. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1430.36s)]
*  But my point is that my first marriage, when you get a divorce, that's a death in the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1431.6s)]
*  family. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1436.32s)]
*  Literally. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1437.12s)]
*  Literally a death. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1438.08s)]
*  And then you are complicit in the commission of that death. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1438.9599999999998s)]
*  It's the husband and the wife. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1443.9199999999998s)]
*  I mean, there are only two people responsible. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1444.8799999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1446.56s)]
*  And so I see a bunch of my friends who are, you can see some veering and teetering. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1446.96s)]
*  And now I can sort of intervene a little bit and just kind of cajole and nudge and, you [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1455.32s)]
*  know, help them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1459.76s)]
*  And I'm not saying that these are all really grand, highfalutin things, but they [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1461.2s)]
*  actually address the inner part of what I needed for a very long time. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1466.08s)]
*  I just didn't realize it. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1469.68s)]
*  No, those are the most important things. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1471.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1473.28s)]
*  If you can help someone save his marriage, I mean, I think that's a lot more important [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1473.68s)]
*  and virtuous than most things that we do. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1478.72s)]
*  Then frankly, most everything, especially when you think of how it compounds to that [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1481.04s)]
*  husband and wife's children. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1485.76s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1487.36s)]
*  It's the key thing. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1488.6399999999999s)]
*  I completely agree. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1490.0s)]
*  And a happy marriage makes happy children. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1491.44s)]
*  So yeah, it redounds through the generations, I would say. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1493.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  So speaking of children, I was having a conversation with one of my children this morning. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1497.76s)]
*  You know, I know a lot of rich people, obviously, and we're talking about somebody who [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1504.16s)]
*  we know, you know, good guy, billionaire, who is totally focused on making more money. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1507.6s)]
*  It's the exclusion of everything else, kind of. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1514.32s)]
*  And one of my children said to me, and not in a judgmental way, but, you know, with [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1517.28s)]
*  affection for this person, but like, why? [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1522.32s)]
*  Like, what is that exactly? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1524.24s)]
*  I mean, why, you know, I guess it's just on autopilot to some extent, like, you know, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1525.52s)]
*  I make money, I'll make more money. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1529.36s)]
*  But, but the drive to make more money that is literally superfluous, like you will never [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1530.64s)]
*  need that money. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1535.44s)]
*  What is that? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1536.72s)]
*  It's an emptiness somewhere else. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1538.48s)]
*  It's a jug that they're trying to fill. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1540.5600000000002s)]
*  And they think that the, you know, the closer they get to filling it, the problem is like [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1543.5200000000002s)]
*  your mind just switches the jug to an even bigger jug. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1548.3200000000002s)]
*  And then it gets closer to being full, and then it switches again and it switches again. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1551.92s)]
*  I think the much better way to think about this problem [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1556.88s)]
*  is what am I doing with my time that actually helps the place that gave me an opportunity [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1559.12s)]
*  be better and the people that live beside me be better. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1565.04s)]
*  That is a really morally valuable statement. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1568.2399999999998s)]
*  And then you can kind of like look at all the things and all the problems that make [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1573.84s)]
*  everybody mad in the United States as an opportunity to actually do them better. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1579.6s)]
*  And that is useful. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1584.56s)]
*  And that is useful. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1585.92s)]
*  And when you have money, the one thing that you can do is you can accelerate that change [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1586.96s)]
*  much faster than folks that have to take a much more arduous path. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1591.04s)]
*  For sure. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1594.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think we've lost that. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1595.76s)]
*  There's not enough people that basically say, okay, you know what? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1597.12s)]
*  The United States has given me so much. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1600.0s)]
*  Now, how do I give back, quote unquote? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1602.72s)]
*  And you don't necessarily have to give back by going into non-profit or going into government. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1605.52s)]
*  You can just acknowledge the problems that are there and go fix them. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1609.12s)]
*  And you can fix them by starting for-profit companies, which are always the best way. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1612.72s)]
*  And I wonder like why don't more people do it? [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1617.92s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1620.64s)]
*  You can have five decent children too, which is probably the best thing you could do for [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1621.12s)]
*  any country. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1624.4s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1626.16s)]
*  But I do notice and have always noticed that some of the people who've benefited most from [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1627.36s)]
*  the United States dislike it the most intensely. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1632.72s)]
*  And I don't really understand what that is. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1634.72s)]
*  I think that that is, I think that what's happened. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1636.48s)]
*  So I'll give you my framework. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1640.3999999999999s)]
*  You can tell me maybe where you agree or disagree, but [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1641.36s)]
*  it is important for all 330 million Americans to take a step back and acknowledge this one truth. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1645.9199999999998s)]
*  And I think that it is completely a canonical statement that is [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1652.8s)]
*  inviolate for being an American. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1656.48s)]
*  We are the single most important country in existence in the world. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1658.56s)]
*  We are the most important country today. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1663.84s)]
*  We must be the most important country tomorrow. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1666.08s)]
*  Period. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1668.8s)]
*  If you say that enough times and you believe it, then there are two things that underpin that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1670.48s)]
*  And I think only two. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1676.72s)]
*  We are the single most vibrant economy in the world. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1678.96s)]
*  And we are the single strongest military in the world. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1682.8s)]
*  And if you can agree to those two things, which I think should be non-controversial, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1688.8s)]
*  if you say, meaning like if I said to you, hey, Tucker, we make the best [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1692.56s)]
*  oranges and burritos in America. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1696.3999999999999s)]
*  That does not yield the most important country in the world. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1698.3200000000002s)]
*  If I said we make the best shoes and the best flat panel TVs, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1701.52s)]
*  that does not equate to the most powerful country in the world. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1706.3200000000002s)]
*  But if I said to you, we have the strongest and most vibrant economy [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1709.2s)]
*  and the strongest and most powerful military, that is the strongest and most important country. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1714.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1719.44s)]
*  And then there is only one thing that gives you both of those two things. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1721.52s)]
*  Which is technological supremacy. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1726.8s)]
*  So go back to these examples. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1729.6s)]
*  If I said to you, we write the best books, those books could be incredibly powerful, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1731.12s)]
*  but it does not give you technical supremacy. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  If I said to you that we have the most abundant energy, oil fields, nat gas, [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  it's important, but it does not give us technological supremacy. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1746.08s)]
*  Those that get there will be in a position to create the most vibrant economy. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1750.88s)]
*  They'll take that money and then create the most powerful military. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1759.84s)]
*  They'll put those two things together. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1762.8s)]
*  They'll be the most powerful country. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1764.24s)]
*  So I think today sitting here, January of 2025, we are in an existential risk of losing [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1766.16s)]
*  our place in the world. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1773.28s)]
*  And the reason is that we had people, we have people from the inside trying to sabotage [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1774.4s)]
*  our economy effectively and trying to sabotage our military capability. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1782.88s)]
*  And they do that not explicitly, but they do that because they are in positions of leadership [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1787.0400000000002s)]
*  and they fundamentally don't know what they're doing. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1792.64s)]
*  And this is what needs to get called out. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1795.44s)]
*  And I think what we need is this wholesale reform of the people that are [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1798.0s)]
*  at the levers and in the controls of these things. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1802.08s)]
*  The lack of economic judgment, the lack of military judgment is ruining America's ability [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1805.92s)]
*  to be the most important country in the world. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1813.12s)]
*  We are, you know, in Silicon Valley, I think it's fair to say that we have had a lost decade. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1815.68s)]
*  And when you look underneath why, what are the two most or three most or four most [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1822.8799999999999s)]
*  incredible technological achievements that the Silicon Valley has created in the last decade? [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1826.96s)]
*  You're hard pressed to find it. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1832.88s)]
*  So in one example, you have Elon, he's created reusable rocketry. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1834.96s)]
*  He's created an entire global mesh of communications infrastructure. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1840.24s)]
*  He's created electric cars. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1845.28s)]
*  That's an incredible thing. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1847.8400000000001s)]
*  And he's done that with one hand tied behind his back, meaning fighting the government, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1850.88s)]
*  local, state, federal at every single turn over the last 10 or 15 years. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1855.1200000000001s)]
*  What have the rest of us done? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1859.1200000000001s)]
*  We've created AirPods and Instagram reels. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1860.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1864.24s)]
*  I think a lot of people fell into the same lull that I fell into. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1866.96s)]
*  We had people pushing back constantly. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1872.4s)]
*  We got distracted. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1875.3600000000001s)]
*  We wasted time. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1876.72s)]
*  We took an entire cadre. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1878.5600000000002s)]
*  Look, engineering is actually very much like professional sports, Tucker. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1880.4s)]
*  There are Michael Jordans in engineering. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1885.04s)]
*  And there are many people that are not very close to Michael Jordan, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1889.28s)]
*  couldn't even make a JV scrub team. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1892.88s)]
*  There is that crazy distribution of capability. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1895.84s)]
*  And let's just say in Silicon Valley, there's 5 million engineers. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1901.1200000000001s)]
*  If you add up all the companies and all the people, maybe that's a lot, but I don't know. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1904.24s)]
*  I can tell you that there's at least 25 or 50,000 of them that are like Michael Jordan-esque capable. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1908.08s)]
*  And instead, what we told these people is, hey, don't win six championships in eight years. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1916.6399999999999s)]
*  Don't be the most prolific player ever. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1922.56s)]
*  What we told them to do was like, hey, you can dribble down the court, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1925.1999999999998s)]
*  but don't dribble too fast because you'll make these other people feel bad. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1927.76s)]
*  Hey, you know what? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1930.1599999999999s)]
*  You can do a couple of layups, but don't do too many layups because you should actually pass the ball [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1931.1999999999998s)]
*  so that these other people we hired because the team photoed them, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1934.56s)]
*  because the team photoed them looks better, give them a chance to score. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1937.04s)]
*  You did all of these dumb things. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1941.04s)]
*  Then team management would come down and say, you know what? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1942.6399999999999s)]
*  I actually think the goal should be to play wiffle ball. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1944.8799999999999s)]
*  And then you take Michael Jordan off the basketball court and you make him play wiffle ball. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1948.6399999999999s)]
*  That's what Silicon Valley did. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1951.68s)]
*  We took all this incredible talent. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1953.92s)]
*  We got distracted by the money. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1956.08s)]
*  Because what really did happen in the Valley? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  What did happen is all the billionaires became deca billionaires and centi billionaires. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1961.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1967.84s)]
*  The wealth went through the roof. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1968.08s)]
*  The innovation went through the floor. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1970.32s)]
*  So we got lulled into this economic complacency. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1974.32s)]
*  My gosh, I'm so much smarter because I'm so much richer. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1979.6s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1982.48s)]
*  No, you're not. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  I'll give you a different example. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1986.08s)]
*  It sounds like just good old fashioned decadence kind of. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1987.2s)]
*  But I think that there was some sabotage, meaning, [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1990.8s)]
*  or maybe sabotage is not the right word, but [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1994.56s)]
*  there were traps that were laid out and we all fell in them. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=1997.36s)]
*  The DEI trap, the woke trap, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2002.0s)]
*  all this kind of stuff that were distractions to core innovation. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2005.36s)]
*  I'll give you two examples that paint the picture. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2010.08s)]
*  I'll bookend it. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2011.92s)]
*  I'll give you a Silicon Valley bookend. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2013.36s)]
*  The beginning of the bookend is in the early 2000s. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2015.76s)]
*  There's an incredible professor, Jennifer Doudna in Berkeley, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2019.04s)]
*  and she pioneers CRISPR, which is the ability to edit genes. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2021.84s)]
*  Let's take that off the table, whether you think it's morally right or wrong for a second. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2026.56s)]
*  It could be a tool. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2030.9599999999998s)]
*  It could be a weapon. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2031.84s)]
*  I grant that. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2032.9599999999998s)]
*  But it is undeniably a tool that sits in the toolbox that we call technological supremacy. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2035.4399999999998s)]
*  Over the next decade, what Silicon Valley managed to do [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2043.12s)]
*  was embroil themselves in IP lawsuits about who actually owned it. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2047.12s)]
*  What China did was take the open source awareness of it and pioneer it. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  Was that smart? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2057.68s)]
*  Whether you agree or you disagree, should that toolbox be in our toolbox where we can meet it out [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2060.48s)]
*  or should it be in China's toolbox where they can decide? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2066.16s)]
*  Where if all of a sudden there is some disease in the future [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2069.28s)]
*  and it requires this very precise form of gene editing and only they can do it, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2074.0s)]
*  and now a state-sponsored entity in China is the one that [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2080.0s)]
*  provision secure for eight billion humans around the world, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2083.04s)]
*  that will give them tremendous economic power. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2087.04s)]
*  Is that smart for America to have done that? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2093.36s)]
*  I think not. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2096.96s)]
*  I'll give you a different example, which is just today as you and I sit here, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2098.24s)]
*  President Biden issued an EO. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2103.12s)]
*  And what the EO said is, executive order, AI is going to be critical, and so we want to [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2105.3599999999997s)]
*  give the ability for federal lands to be used for AI data centers. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2115.04s)]
*  Okay, now you're cooking. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2122.24s)]
*  This sounds smart. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2124.0s)]
*  Let's go read the fine print. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2124.9599999999996s)]
*  And by the second or third paragraph, what it says is, however, we need to think about the, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2126.64s)]
*  diversity and equity inclusions of said data centers, and, no, hold on, and, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2132.64s)]
*  you have to basically give preference to clean power. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2142.08s)]
*  Well, is that the same clean power that was essentially made impossible because of [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2147.44s)]
*  permitting issues and environmental impact studies? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2152.72s)]
*  You can't just build solar farms that you want to. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2155.68s)]
*  You can't build wind farms that you want to. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2158.4s)]
*  You can't build wind farms in America if you want to. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2161.12s)]
*  You can't build nuclear reactors because they won't let you. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2164.0s)]
*  These are not technological limitations. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2168.48s)]
*  These were regulatory limitations. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2170.4s)]
*  Those are just two examples that just show you, you cannot do what's in America's best [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2173.2s)]
*  interests right now because people have forgot, they've lost the script. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2177.52s)]
*  They forgot the priorities. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2181.2799999999997s)]
*  Guys, the priorities are, we need to remain the most singularly powerful economic and military [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2183.3599999999997s)]
*  entity in the world. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2190.0s)]
*  The way you do that is through technical supremacy, period. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2191.68s)]
*  I'll give you another two examples just to, you can tell me if these are boring, but- [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2194.32s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2198.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is doing an incredible job. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2200.56s)]
*  They're monetizing their oil. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2202.96s)]
*  They are doing very strategic things with the capital. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2205.68s)]
*  What they've decided is they're going to allocate money that they take from selling oil [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2211.84s)]
*  to build a global data center infrastructure for AI. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2217.2s)]
*  That's really smart. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2220.7999999999997s)]
*  When you look at Saudi Arabia on a map, you think, oh my gosh, this is very smart. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2222.8799999999997s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2228.3999999999996s)]
*  Because they sit right in this artery between Asia, Europe, and Africa. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2228.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2232.72s)]
*  This is critically smart. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2235.2s)]
*  But what is the one thing that they need that they don't have? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2238.4799999999996s)]
*  It's AI chips. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2242.3199999999997s)]
*  Now, AI, just to break it down for your viewers, think of AI as two buckets. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2244.1600000000003s)]
*  Bucket number one is where you train the brain. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2251.92s)]
*  Think of AI as a brain. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2255.92s)]
*  Bucket number one, you train the brain. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2256.96s)]
*  Bucket number two, you use the brain to make decisions. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2259.04s)]
*  The chips that we make to train the brain are under export control. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2263.52s)]
*  We don't want folks to train their own brains necessarily unless we can govern them. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2270.32s)]
*  That's a Department of Commerce decision on export licensing. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2275.6800000000003s)]
*  The way that we use the brain is a different kind of chip. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2280.48s)]
*  We have some export controls there. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2284.6400000000003s)]
*  What will Saudi eventually be forced to do? [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2289.6s)]
*  They're an ally of America. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2293.28s)]
*  They want to do the right thing. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2295.1200000000003s)]
*  They have a responsibility to their people to try to become the most incredible economic [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  and military power in the world. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2303.2s)]
*  They're going to go and buy the chips from the people that will actually sell it to them. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2305.6s)]
*  They'll look east, of course. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2308.8s)]
*  They will look east and they'll find it in China. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2309.84s)]
*  Yet a different example. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2314.32s)]
*  If you look at Metta, Metta has poured tens of billions of dollars to training a brain, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2317.68s)]
*  an AI brain that's called Lama. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2324.4s)]
*  That's Metta's efforts in AI. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2327.04s)]
*  It's open source. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2331.52s)]
*  It's wonderful, actually. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2332.7200000000003s)]
*  My companies use it. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2334.32s)]
*  It works. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2336.16s)]
*  It's high quality. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2336.96s)]
*  Open AI, which is the private closed source competitor to Metta and Lama, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2340.2400000000002s)]
*  also has an AI brain that they've trained. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2346.56s)]
*  GPT, chat GPT, you've used it probably. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2349.44s)]
*  They've also spent tens of billions of dollars in part coming from Microsoft. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2352.3199999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, in December, a Chinese company open sourced a model where they spent [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2359.12s)]
*  tens of millions of dollars. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2366.64s)]
*  In many cases, that digital brain is smarter than both Metta and open AIs on many dimensions. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2369.6s)]
*  Two orders of magnitude cheaper. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2378.48s)]
*  What do you think that means for the other 182 countries around the world that wants [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2381.36s)]
*  to do something in AI? [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2385.28s)]
*  Are they going to take the $10 billion version or are they going to take the $10 million [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  version? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2391.2000000000003s)]
*  They're going to take the $10 million one. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2391.6s)]
*  When you unpack, why did it cost $10 billion? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2394.32s)]
*  That was my question. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2397.92s)]
*  It cost $10 billion because of all the roadblocks that we put in front of companies [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2399.6s)]
*  to make the things that we need to maintain our technical supremacy. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2405.6800000000003s)]
*  I'll give you some examples. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2408.64s)]
*  There is a huge, so for example, one of the things that China chooses to not do is they [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2411.28s)]
*  don't really respect copyright law. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2416.32s)]
*  Now, I'm not saying we should violate copyright law, but I think it's important to acknowledge [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2418.8s)]
*  that there is a technical overhang that it creates in training these brains to try to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2423.76s)]
*  filter out content that the New York Times tags or Fox News tags and says, don't learn [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2429.92s)]
*  on this. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2434.96s)]
*  You're not allowed unless you have a deal with me. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2436.0s)]
*  That creates an enormous layer of expense. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2437.84s)]
*  How do we judge that issue? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2441.1200000000003s)]
*  Today, if you ask somebody, it's a pretty simple conversation. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2443.52s)]
*  It's not nuanced. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2449.44s)]
*  It's do you believe in copyright or do you not believe in copyright? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2450.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's a much more nuanced question. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2453.84s)]
*  For the sake of training these digital brains, if there was an economic relationship that [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2457.28s)]
*  we could create, isn't it better that our digital brain is smarter than these other [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2461.44s)]
*  ones and that we make it as cheap as possible? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2465.76s)]
*  If you ask that question, a lot of people would say, gosh, that's a nuanced question. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2468.88s)]
*  It's not. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2474.4s)]
*  It's neither an easy no or an easy yes, but on the margins, I would say yes, knowing that [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2474.88s)]
*  there are these impacts. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2480.4s)]
*  Give you a different example. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2482.88s)]
*  It takes all this energy to build the data centers. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2484.6400000000003s)]
*  Why does it cost so much? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2490.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not that the let's just say you want to take a look at the data centers. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2491.6800000000003s)]
*  Let's say you wanted to use solar panels. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2495.28s)]
*  Is it that the solar panels are expensive? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2497.76s)]
*  No. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2499.92s)]
*  Is it that the ability to do the interconnects are expensive? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2501.1200000000003s)]
*  No. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2504.88s)]
*  It's that building that facility had a multi-year environmental impact study, umpteen [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2506.2400000000002s)]
*  lawsuits, all kinds of indirection and misdirection from all of these independent [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  who believed that they were pursuing their own priorities. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2520.08s)]
*  And there was no release valve that said, I appreciate and respect the smelt that you're [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2524.16s)]
*  trying to protect or the land grouse, but this is bigger than that. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2531.6s)]
*  We need to make sure we maintain our technical superiority. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2536.88s)]
*  That data center is going to be used by the NSA to protect America. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2539.44s)]
*  So it needs to go up in nine months. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2543.44s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2546.64s)]
*  Right now we don't have the ability to say that or if we do, it's not clear who should say it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2547.6s)]
*  And so all of this time costs money. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2553.04s)]
*  All of this complexity costs money. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2556.4s)]
*  And the output are practical costs of building these things that are just two orders of magnitude [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2559.6s)]
*  bigger than our competitors. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2565.6s)]
*  We're not going to use the word revival, but it does seem true that millions of Americans [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2566.96s)]
*  simultaneously are coming to the conclusion that buying things online and going on vacation [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2571.44s)]
*  may not be the sum total purpose of life. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2576.32s)]
*  Maybe there's something more. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2579.36s)]
*  And if you're one of those people who's beginning to ask questions, what else is there? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2580.7200000000003s)]
*  One of those people who's become suddenly very interested in God and having a relationship with [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2585.44s)]
*  God, then we cannot recommend an app called Hallow enough. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2590.32s)]
*  Personally recommend it. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2595.36s)]
*  It's a frequent topic of conversation in my house. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2596.56s)]
*  Hallow is the number one prayer app in the world that offers thousands of guided prayers, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2599.1200000000003s)]
*  of guided prayers, meditations, music options, Gregorian chants, the Bible in a year. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2604.24s)]
*  It's amazing what's on there. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2610.72s)]
*  It's great. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2612.24s)]
*  Hallow is fantastic. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2613.44s)]
*  It's very easy to use. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2614.4s)]
*  You build a routine. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2615.36s)]
*  You can join groups of worshipers, set goals, tailor the whole experience to your exact [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2616.48s)]
*  spiritual needs. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2620.96s)]
*  It really works. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2622.56s)]
*  Most apps people get excited about then stop using them. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2624.3199999999997s)]
*  Hallow, people keep using it because it's great. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2628.0s)]
*  We recently interviewed the founder and CEO of Hallow and that conversation left us more [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2630.88s)]
*  convinced than ever that this will never become a godless society because people won't let [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2634.8s)]
*  that happen. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2639.28s)]
*  People need God. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2640.1600000000003s)]
*  Hallow can help connect you with God. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2641.36s)]
*  With the March for Life approaching, it's a perfect time to download the Hallow app [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2643.6s)]
*  to unlock a vast array of prayers for pregnant mothers, the unborn, civil leaders, and many [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2646.7200000000003s)]
*  others in need of prayer because prayer actually works. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2651.84s)]
*  Head over to Hallow.com slash Tucker get three months free. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2656.4s)]
*  Hallow. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2660.08s)]
*  It's awesome. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2661.04s)]
*  I wonder though if just the basic economics of AI just force change. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2662.0s)]
*  For example, the power draw for AI, I was hearing about it, that was an AI center in [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2669.52s)]
*  another country three days ago and they were saying they're not exactly sure what it's [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2674.64s)]
*  going to take to run one, but it could be 10X normal data center, which is that was [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2680.72s)]
*  amazing to me. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2686.24s)]
*  So how do you power that exactly? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2687.52s)]
*  So you have these competing imperatives. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2689.68s)]
*  You've got the climate agenda versus AI, which is clearly the future of the economy of California, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2691.44s)]
*  for example. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2697.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2697.7599999999998s)]
*  Can I just say, okay, I have to go on a small diatribe. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2698.08s)]
*  Please do. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2701.44s)]
*  I'm trying to evoke one. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2702.3199999999997s)]
*  There is nothing that the Western countries can do that will equate in any way, shape, [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2706.0s)]
*  or form the impact of what China and India decides to do. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2714.16s)]
*  We do not live in small bubbles. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2718.56s)]
*  There is no glass bubble that sits on top of the United States. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  We all share an ecology that ecology is extremely complicated and nuanced and it's a global one. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2726.4s)]
*  And the reality is that India and China collectively together have way more impact than [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2733.68s)]
*  what you and I are going to do by becoming vegans. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2740.16s)]
*  Impact on the climate of the environment. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2744.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2747.44s)]
*  I've noticed, yes. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2748.3199999999997s)]
*  So I think the reason why, for example, like we have, again, so we have lost so much ground. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2749.52s)]
*  The California wildfires are an example that lays us bare. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2755.12s)]
*  We should have 50% of the American population on solar panels and battery walls today. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2760.56s)]
*  The reason it's nice to have that you do it for climate change, but the reason is resilience. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2768.72s)]
*  The reason is so that you can power yourself in moments of calamity. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2774.08s)]
*  The reason is so that you can make sure that you can take care of your family, cook food, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2778.64s)]
*  desalinate water, whatever it is that you need to do. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2783.2s)]
*  The prepper approached energy. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2785.6s)]
*  I'm with you. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2787.04s)]
*  It's just like the practical reality. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2787.84s)]
*  Totally agree. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2789.6s)]
*  And instead we make it this sort of like moral blanket that you have to wrap yourself in. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2791.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2796.3199999999997s)]
*  Everybody then takes a view and all it does is retard progress. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2796.88s)]
*  We spend way too much time getting distracted on fringe ideas and we need to recalibrate. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2800.48s)]
*  We need to be and we need to remain the most singular muscular power in the world, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2809.36s)]
*  which comes from economic and military supremacy, which comes from only one thing, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2815.2s)]
*  technical supremacy. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2820.0s)]
*  So you have to find a way of enabling those 50,000 Michael Jordan's, the people who are [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2820.96s)]
*  in America to cook, let them cook. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2826.56s)]
*  That's what you need to do. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2835.84s)]
*  I wonder if the structure of Silicon Valley or- [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  Can I give you a different example? [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2840.08s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2841.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2841.36s)]
*  This is my last one. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2842.0s)]
*  One of the big pushes in AI is in robotics. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2846.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2848.08s)]
*  And just to double click into a robot, a robot moves through these things called actuators. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2849.04s)]
*  Okay. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2854.48s)]
*  And one of the things that actuators needs, one of the ways that they generate mechanical [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2855.6000000000004s)]
*  motion, 3D planar mechanical motion, is through the use of magnets, permanent magnets. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2860.7200000000003s)]
*  And permanent magnets are different than the ones you and I play with or what our kids play with. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2867.36s)]
*  They are made from these things called rare earth metals. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2871.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2875.04s)]
*  And rare earths are a misnomer. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2876.56s)]
*  They are not rare, but they are abundantly available in the earth. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2878.32s)]
*  There is an incredible supply of rare earths in California. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2883.84s)]
*  You could not, for the life of you, get a permit in California, no matter how clean, how green, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2891.2000000000003s)]
*  to mine those materials to make sure that we could make magnets so that we could make the robots, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2899.52s)]
*  so that we maintained our technical supremacy. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2904.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2907.84s)]
*  That's how that decision I think should get made. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2908.08s)]
*  We want technical supremacy in the next five to 10 years. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2910.64s)]
*  There's going to be a huge wave in robotics. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2913.28s)]
*  America needs to be at the forefront. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2915.44s)]
*  America needs to make them. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2917.52s)]
*  We need to understand how to program them. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2919.36s)]
*  Our robots need to be smarter. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2922.08s)]
*  So there's an AI track, right? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2924.24s)]
*  There's a mechanical engineering track. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2925.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2927.68s)]
*  Well, there's a mining track. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2928.0s)]
*  Let's get the materials. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2929.36s)]
*  Let's make sure that we are beholden to nobody so that we can make them. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2930.56s)]
*  By the way, these are all great paying jobs if you were able to actually get them permitted. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2934.8s)]
*  And when push comes to shove, when it's like, yeah, get the rare earths out of the ground [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2939.04s)]
*  and make the permanent magnets, can't do it. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2942.64s)]
*  Why? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2944.96s)]
*  You're going to spend 13 years in permitting hell in California to try to get that done. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2946.7200000000003s)]
*  So, and I know this, the reason I know this is that I started a business [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2951.44s)]
*  to make sure that China does not have access to the only supply of rare earths. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2959.12s)]
*  And I initially tried to do it in California, impossible. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2964.7999999999997s)]
*  I invested in one business that actually had an old mind that we were able to get back online [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2969.04s)]
*  through a bank bankruptcy process and blah, blah, blah, but it's not nearly enough. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2974.48s)]
*  So I went to India and I was able to get a deal done with the Indian government. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2978.4s)]
*  And what they were able to see was the strategic rationale of making sure we had access to not [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2985.2799999999997s)]
*  only the rare earths, but to also to make sure that there were subsidies. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2990.0s)]
*  So that they would compete on the global stage cheaper than China. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2993.44s)]
*  And now I can bring them back into the United States to make these magnets. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=2998.48s)]
*  Would I like to do that in America? [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3001.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  Can I? [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3004.7200000000003s)]
*  Impossible. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3005.36s)]
*  I'd be sitting around twiddling my thumbs for a decade. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3006.0s)]
*  The guys in India did that deal with me in less than 18 months. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3009.68s)]
*  They understand there's an escalation point where they'll sit down and say, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3014.08s)]
*  Chamath, what do you need? [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3017.6s)]
*  What makes sense? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3019.12s)]
*  And I say, well, sir, here's what I need. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3019.92s)]
*  And they say, well, sir, here's what we're trying to do. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3021.76s)]
*  Here's why it's important. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3024.0800000000004s)]
*  Here's why having a global supply chain that's independent of China is just important. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3025.36s)]
*  It's competitive. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3029.44s)]
*  It's good for everybody. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3030.32s)]
*  They're like, okay, great. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3031.84s)]
*  X, Y, and Z do the following three things. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3032.96s)]
*  Build a plant over there. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3034.96s)]
*  We'll make sure that we support you. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3036.1600000000003s)]
*  Here, we're just going to a morass and die. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3039.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, can we generate the hardware to generate the electricity necessary to remain dominant? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3043.5200000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3050.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3051.2s)]
*  So the other crazy thing about that Biden EO is why couldn't you have just stopped the EO [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3052.48s)]
*  at that first paragraph? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3061.36s)]
*  Because it wouldn't include the control provisions, which are the whole point of it. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3063.84s)]
*  We control your behavior. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3068.4s)]
*  We give you something, but then we're in charge. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3069.44s)]
*  We're in charge. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3070.96s)]
*  We have more nat gas and oil in the United States. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3072.4s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this, Tucker, but there was a piece of data that came out this week, [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3077.04s)]
*  but our reliance on foreign oil is almost entirely gone. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3080.56s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3087.36s)]
*  Meaning like almost like to where we don't even need to buy it anymore. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3088.24s)]
*  Not just that we make more than we import, but where the imports will soon go to zero. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3091.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3096.32s)]
*  That's an incredible statement about the energy independence of America. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3096.72s)]
*  It's the single most obvious way to, by the way, to guarantee peace. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3100.08s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3104.64s)]
*  If you're not fighting over that critical resource, it's going to be very unlikely you're [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3105.7599999999998s)]
*  going to go to war, which if you look past the last four or five years, four or five wars, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3109.36s)]
*  the trillions of dollars and the hundreds of thousands of American lives, what were they [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3114.2400000000002s)]
*  all about oil? [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3117.28s)]
*  And now, you know, we have the ability to power those data centers. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3119.84s)]
*  So should data centers be built in a fair, predictable way on federal land? [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3125.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3132.0s)]
*  Because it feeds the technical supremacy we all need. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3132.32s)]
*  Now, by the way, there is a conversation to be had is, okay, great. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3135.52s)]
*  When you have all this economic abundance, how do you share it more? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3138.56s)]
*  I get that. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3141.2799999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3142.08s)]
*  But at least you're in a position to have the conversation. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3142.56s)]
*  That yeah, that is jumping ahead. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3146.4s)]
*  So back to this, though, but like, you know, if you're able to build these things, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3148.4s)]
*  I think what Biden should have done is just say, hey, listen, folks, do your best, get the energy [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3151.84s)]
*  because it exists. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3156.16s)]
*  Use Nat gas, use oil, and we will figure it out after we've won. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3157.68s)]
*  That feels like leadership. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3163.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3166.0s)]
*  But he can't do that because he's surrounded by people who have already said no hydrocarbons, period. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3166.24s)]
*  But it's not rooted in any reality. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3174.24s)]
*  No, I'm aware. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3176.4s)]
*  I'm aware. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3178.08s)]
*  It's rooted in moral grandstanding. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3180.32s)]
*  Oh, I've noticed. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3183.28s)]
*  But I just think that we're I mean, if you've got mandates for net zero or mandates for no [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3184.4s)]
*  hydrocarbons, mandates for EVs, and this economic imperative around AI, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3189.68s)]
*  I just don't and people like air conditioning. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3195.76s)]
*  I just don't think we're going to have enough electricity unless there's [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3197.76s)]
*  hardware built like really soon. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3200.32s)]
*  It's it's incredible that you mentioned air conditioning. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3203.28s)]
*  So back to sort of one of these back to one of these ways where I was like, you know, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3206.56s)]
*  after 2022, how can I just get back to basics and do the things that I do well? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3211.04s)]
*  One of the projects that I started with this incredible mechanical engineer was [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3217.28s)]
*  we set out to rebuild the air conditioner. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3222.32s)]
*  Yeah, good. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3224.1600000000003s)]
*  And when you look at air conditioners, the heat transfer mechanisms [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3225.76s)]
*  can be made much, much more efficient and you don't have to use this horrible coolants. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3229.2000000000003s)]
*  And so we have a working version now. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3235.6800000000003s)]
*  It's like our second prototype. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3239.84s)]
*  We're probably two years away from getting something working. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3241.04s)]
*  But when that works, by the way, we've started a process to figure out how do we sell it. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3243.52s)]
*  But this is again, Tucker, it's like, if I tried to sell it to a home, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3248.96s)]
*  the number of people that want to touch that thing. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3253.44s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3255.84s)]
*  It will take me an extra hundred and fifty million dollars and an extra extra hundred [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3256.48s)]
*  and fifty. It'll take a hundred hundred fifty million to build it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3261.36s)]
*  It'll take an extra hundred and fifty million and an extra seven years. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3264.2400000000002s)]
*  To comply with code. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3268.4s)]
*  Yeah. What like what is it that I'm supposed to do? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3269.44s)]
*  And by the way, not to be like pedantic, but those rules were never passed by the Congress. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3273.12s)]
*  I don't think those rules were passed by people even to give them the benefit of the [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3278.56s)]
*  doubt. By one degree removed, folks that even have an understanding of like physics. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3283.6s)]
*  No, well, of course not. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3290.88s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3292.16s)]
*  So there was probably a very smart, capable lawyer representing some smart [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3293.2s)]
*  organization who knew that this was something that they could write in to slow people down. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3297.92s)]
*  But what people need to understand is it again, it just slows down our ability to remain number one. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3303.76s)]
*  But where does this I think you're exactly right. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3308.96s)]
*  I think you've described it very nicely, but I'm still baffled by the motive. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3311.28s)]
*  Why would people in a country as great as ours want to wreck the country? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3316.96s)]
*  Where does that come from? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3321.36s)]
*  I don't think that they want to wreck the country as much as I think that they [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3323.28s)]
*  have lost the global context. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3329.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't think they understand that we are in an existential risk of no longer being number one. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3332.0s)]
*  And I think that they also don't understand the implications if we are not number one. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3339.68s)]
*  You need to just look at the UK. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3345.7599999999998s)]
*  If you want to have a very simple and visible picture of a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant nation [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3347.7599999999998s)]
*  completely losing itself, totally losing the economic war, losing the military war, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3357.2s)]
*  losing the technology war, and fighting a fringe issue war, you need to just look there. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3365.6s)]
*  And people should ask themselves, is that what we aspire to? [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3374.4s)]
*  I'd rather live in Pakistan than live in the UK. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3378.24s)]
*  I'm being serious. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3380.96s)]
*  I think it's the most depressing country on the planet for the reasons you just described. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3381.92s)]
*  There's something about decline that's hard to describe, but when you're there, you feel it. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3385.6s)]
*  It's terrible. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3391.04s)]
*  Oh, it's sold. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3391.52s)]
*  It's so much worse. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3392.48s)]
*  You're much better off, to your point, being in a developing nation on the come up than you are. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3393.76s)]
*  100%. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3397.76s)]
*  Than you are being in a- [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3398.1600000000003s)]
*  There are over 200,000 Brits in UAE right now. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3399.6s)]
*  In UAE, which they formally controlled until not that long ago. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3403.44s)]
*  And now there's a massive outflow. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3407.44s)]
*  There are far more Brits in the Emirates than there are Emiratis in Britain. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3409.92s)]
*  So the thing that we need to do, I think, as a Western set of nations, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3414.08s)]
*  is we need to understand and agree on the fact that governance over this last decade [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3418.48s)]
*  has totally and miserably failed by focusing on these fringe issues [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3426.0s)]
*  and by losing sight of these global priorities. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3429.84s)]
*  I'll give you a different example. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3432.56s)]
*  At the end of the global financial crisis, Canada emerged as the healthiest G7 country [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3434.88s)]
*  out of all of us. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3441.6s)]
*  They were doing phenomenally well, low debt to GDP, phenomenal growth. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3443.84s)]
*  And then over those intervening 17 years, they focused on all kinds of fringe issues. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3449.36s)]
*  Rampant open immigration, poor allocation of risk capital inside of Canada. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3455.44s)]
*  They've allowed this incredible flight of human capital to the United States. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3462.56s)]
*  And now today, if Canada were to join the United States, it would be poorer than Alabama [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3468.56s)]
*  on a per capita basis. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3475.36s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3476.32s)]
*  And much more depressing. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3477.3599999999997s)]
*  So what has happened in Canada? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3479.2799999999997s)]
*  There's a vibe shift when countries decline. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3480.56s)]
*  It's not simply a matter of GDP moving in the wrong direction. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3482.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the spirit of the country is palpably different and sad. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3485.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's why so many Canadians accept their government's invitation to kill them [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3490.24s)]
*  through the maids program. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3494.72s)]
*  Their suicide rate is insane. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3495.92s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3497.52s)]
*  That's not a measure, that's a sign of health or vigor or ascendance. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3498.0s)]
*  That's a sign of terminal decline. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3503.04s)]
*  It's shocking. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3506.4s)]
*  You're from there. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3507.28s)]
*  When you go back, what does it feel like? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3508.0s)]
*  My dad passed away 10 years ago. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3510.88s)]
*  My mom now comes to see us, so I rarely go back. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3512.2400000000002s)]
*  Actually, I'm going to be back in February for a little bit. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3514.88s)]
*  I've always felt like a fish out of water in Canada. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3519.92s)]
*  I've loved it for many reasons. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3522.88s)]
*  I think that it had some principles back then that I think are very legitimate and I think [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3524.8s)]
*  should exist in the United States. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3530.4s)]
*  The most important being a capped cost of higher education. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3532.0s)]
*  I spent $12,000 a year to get an electrical engineering degree from a place called the [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3536.4s)]
*  University of Waterloo, which globally is as good, frankly, better than MIT. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3542.88s)]
*  If I had to be in the United States and if I had gotten into MIT, which I probably would [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3549.6800000000003s)]
*  not have, but had I been able to, I'd be $100,000 or $200,000 in debt. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3553.2000000000003s)]
*  And so had I not had this lottery ticket for me pay off with an IPO and working at Facebook, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3559.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know where I would be today. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3565.2s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3567.4399999999996s)]
*  So there are things that Canada, I think, and we should acknowledge that does really [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3568.16s)]
*  right. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3572.64s)]
*  That is probably the most important thing that it does right. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3572.96s)]
*  And I think the idea of a state-sponsored healthcare system, it's implemented horribly [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3578.08s)]
*  poorly, but there are elements of that where I think, especially around capped costs, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3582.48s)]
*  which I think are important meaning. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3589.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, in the United States, a healthcare CEO was telling me when you look inside of [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3592.32s)]
*  an EMR system, the electronic medical care system, let's say Tucker, you're a doctor [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3596.4s)]
*  and you did a knee surgery. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3600.4s)]
*  You would have a hundred different prices attached to you depending on the plan, depending [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3602.6400000000003s)]
*  on the insurer. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3608.48s)]
*  That's dumb. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3610.4s)]
*  You are one person. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3611.92s)]
*  Those are one set of hands. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3613.1200000000003s)]
*  That's one surgery. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3614.88s)]
*  It's one quality. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3616.56s)]
*  The idea that one person is lucky enough to pay a thousand dollar deductible and the other [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3618.08s)]
*  person has to pay 50,000 is an egregious market failure. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3621.52s)]
*  It's just egregious. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3625.68s)]
*  So Tucker Carlson, the best knee surgeon in America, if he charges 2,000, then he charges [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3627.92s)]
*  2,000 for everybody. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3634.16s)]
*  That seems fair. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3636.24s)]
*  It does seem fair. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3638.16s)]
*  It seems much more efficient. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3638.88s)]
*  I just can't. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3640.3199999999997s)]
*  Now everything else in Canada is broken, I think, but those two ideas. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3641.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, their healthcare system is a disaster. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3644.16s)]
*  The implementation then of the system. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3645.92s)]
*  So my question is, it's like one of those things that I'm not against it in theory, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3648.0s)]
*  but I can't think of, I mean, national health system doesn't work. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3651.6800000000003s)]
*  Canadian healthcare system doesn't work. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3656.0s)]
*  I mean, is there a working national healthcare system? [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3657.52s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3660.48s)]
*  I think that you need to have competition. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3660.88s)]
*  I think you need to have, there's a hybrid that the United States could implement that [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3665.84s)]
*  is not NHS or the Canadian system, but it's not just a pure free market free for all. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3671.12s)]
*  It's a little bit in between. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3680.0s)]
*  Let me describe what the in-between parts are. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3681.44s)]
*  Medicare is an incredibly important insurance program in the United States. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3685.12s)]
*  I think it stands to reason that Medicare should have its own PPM. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3690.3199999999997s)]
*  If Medicare was able to negotiate, you know, an extremely aggressive price for drugs, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3694.0s)]
*  it sets the boundary for what is allowable for everybody else. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3700.96s)]
*  And for folks that are 65 and older, then now they have a very viable alternative to use that. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3705.92s)]
*  It also creates transparency around the variation in pricing. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3711.52s)]
*  Number one. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3715.36s)]
*  Number two, there needs to be a way where a private insurer can build up some credit [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3716.24s)]
*  for doing things today that may only pay off for that employee in the future when he's no longer [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3725.2799999999997s)]
*  an employee. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3732.16s)]
*  So for example, you worked at Fox. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3732.72s)]
*  Should the Fox insurance program have put you on a statin? [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3735.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm making this up. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3738.7999999999997s)]
*  Have put you on a statin in your early 40s, early 40s, early 40s, early 40s, early 40s, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3739.7599999999998s)]
*  to help you manage your right. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3746.72s)]
*  I'm not saying you have rising cholesterol, but you know, if you had that, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3748.96s)]
*  because in 10 or 15 years from now, it would help a potential cardiac arrest or heart attack. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3752.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3759.84s)]
*  A lot of the companies that are faced with this decision today say we're not going to do that [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3761.6s)]
*  because you may not be an employee in 15 years. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3765.68s)]
*  So why am I paying now for something where I get the benefit? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3767.92s)]
*  But that's a simple health care economics market solution. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3771.2799999999997s)]
*  We should have those. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3774.64s)]
*  We should give private insurers incentives to, you know, in some cases, maybe the right thing to do [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3775.8399999999997s)]
*  is to put people on OZMPEC and MUNJARRO. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3781.6s)]
*  Do the work now. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3784.56s)]
*  I understand that that employee may be retired by the time that, you know, they may need that, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3785.6s)]
*  but it was the right thing to do for that person for having worked for you for 15 or 20 years. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3792.72s)]
*  Another thing, with AI today, [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3797.6s)]
*  with AI today, you can read all of these insurance plans [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3800.96s)]
*  and you should have a standard way of knowing that a condition is going to get approved or not [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3807.6800000000003s)]
*  before it starts. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3814.4s)]
*  And that needs to be auditable. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3815.76s)]
*  It cannot be where you need like a PhD and five different people to read these insurance plans [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3818.32s)]
*  and then all of a sudden a random person can make an economic decision to say no. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3826.32s)]
*  That's also where, you know, simple technology can get built to build very strict guardrails. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3833.92s)]
*  What is approved? [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3840.32s)]
*  What is not approved? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3841.1200000000003s)]
*  Have it be known, have it be auditable, be in a log so that, you know, people can just simply escalate. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3842.32s)]
*  Hey, that person got his approved and mine was dinged. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3849.28s)]
*  Why? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3851.6800000000003s)]
*  So there's all these little things to like make the system better. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3853.04s)]
*  It needs to be more open. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3855.52s)]
*  You need to have, for example, a different on the case of open. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3857.36s)]
*  It is highly unlikely that you've ever tried to get all of your health care data. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3862.32s)]
*  Impossible. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3866.64s)]
*  Now you would say, Chamath, why would I need that? [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3867.12s)]
*  Maybe there's an AI agent that can actually be your doctor in your pocket that just works for Tucker. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3869.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, it's the person that is constantly reading my every interaction with the health [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3875.36s)]
*  care system to tell me what they think. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3881.04s)]
*  It's my own second opinion. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3883.84s)]
*  That's not a bad idea. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3885.84s)]
*  That's a very low cost thing to do, except you can't get the data. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3886.8s)]
*  Why can't you get the data? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3891.44s)]
*  Because there's federal regulations and most people don't listen to them. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3892.48s)]
*  Federal regulations, TEFCA says you have to be able to download your data. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3896.08s)]
*  These companies make it very hard because they know the more open it becomes, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3901.36s)]
*  it induces competition. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3905.44s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3907.12s)]
*  Competition that will show up will probably be infinitely better. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3907.84s)]
*  So I'm going to do everything I can to block it. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3912.0s)]
*  And, you know, the federal and state governments don't do enough. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3913.92s)]
*  In America, we do things a little differently and we always have. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3916.4s)]
*  But the British said, hey, we're going to tax your favorite morning beverage. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3919.92s)]
*  The Revolutionary Sons of Liberty said no, and they poured the entire shipment of tea [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3924.0s)]
*  into Boston Harbor and created a new country, a country based on personal choice and freedom. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3928.88s)]
*  Well, 251 years later, it is time to throw something else overboard. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3935.6800000000003s)]
*  Your overpriced big wireless contract, you don't need it. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3939.92s)]
*  Do you need to pay $100 a month just to get a free phone? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3944.96s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3949.12s)]
*  The cell phone company we use, PureTalk, says no to all of this inflated prices, the BS, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3950.96s)]

*  With PureTalk, it's super straightforward. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=3962.2400000000002s)]

*  What, looking down the next five years, name three or four innovations that you're pretty [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4008.3199999999997s)]
*  certain we're going to see life enhancers from AI. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4013.68s)]
*  I start companies. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4022.96s)]
*  But when I don't see something that I think I can start right away and there's somebody [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4026.88s)]
*  that's a little bit in the lead, I'll just invest and I'll just take a large piece so [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4030.08s)]
*  that I can help guide them. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4033.36s)]
*  One of those businesses where I'm the largest shareholder has been working on breast cancer [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4034.88s)]
*  surgery. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4040.72s)]
*  And today across America, for every 10 women that go and get diagnosed with breast cancer, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4042.48s)]
*  three of the surgeries leave cancer behind. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4049.6s)]
*  Ouch. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4055.04s)]
*  And the way that it works is you go in for what's called, so there's two different kinds [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4055.52s)]
*  of breast cancer surgery. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4059.04s)]
*  There's a lumpectomy, which is take out the lump, or a mastectomy, which is take out the [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4059.8399999999997s)]
*  entire breast. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4064.48s)]
*  And in the lumpectomy, you have to have, you visualize with your own eyes whether you think [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4066.24s)]
*  most of the cancer is gone. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4072.56s)]
*  You close up the woman and you take that sample. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4074.4s)]
*  And you take that sample, you give it to a pathologist, and typically between seven and [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4077.4399999999996s)]
*  11 days, which is how long it takes because they're clogged up and there's backlog, they'll [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4082.72s)]
*  look under a microscope and visually inspect and say, actually, sorry, 30% of the time they [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4087.9199999999996s)]
*  say you left some cancer behind. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4092.8799999999997s)]
*  So now that woman has to, those three women have to go back. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4096.0s)]
*  They get another surgery, but again, 30% error rate. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4099.28s)]
*  They do it again. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4102.8s)]
*  And then one of those women gets dinked. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4104.4s)]
*  So now one woman has had three breast cancer surgeries. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4105.92s)]
*  That is happening today. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4109.68s)]
*  Now, if you go to a really, really good teaching hospital, that error rate will be 5% because the [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4111.6s)]
*  docs are incredible. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4118.8s)]
*  If you go to an overly zealous doctor, that error rate will also be low, but you'll come [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4121.04s)]
*  in for a lumpectomy, you'll end up with a mastectomy kind of a thing. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4126.32s)]
*  They'll just take out so much of that and that creates a disfiguration. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4129.68s)]
*  So this company basically says, hold on a second, I'll just use AI. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4136.0s)]
*  I'll look right down to the granular microscopic level. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4140.32s)]
*  I'll take an extremely high-res picture. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4144.16s)]
*  My brain will be trained on only this one task. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4147.2s)]
*  Is there cancer? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4150.64s)]
*  Is there no cancer? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4151.36s)]
*  So we built it and it's in a bunch of the leading hospitals in America, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4153.2s)]
*  but we had to file with the FDA to be allowed to tell the doctor. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4159.52s)]
*  Right? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4166.08s)]
*  So I just want to be clear, we know, we can see it. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4166.32s)]
*  And so we ran an 18-month trial, you know, cost us 10 or 15 million bucks. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4172.0s)]
*  And we met our end point in November. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4178.32s)]
*  We can now absolutely be sure that the cancer was removed or not removed. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4183.52s)]
*  Now we have to package all of that up. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4190.0s)]
*  We've filed it with the FDA. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4192.24s)]
*  We've been told we'll get approval by June and then we'll be able to sell, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4194.8s)]
*  meaning sell the software upgrade so that essentially in the operating room, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4200.72s)]
*  instead of having to wait for the pathologist seven to 11 days later, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4205.76s)]
*  the doctor will do the lumpectomy, put it in the machine and instantly you'll say, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4209.68s)]
*  Tucker, you need to take out a little bit more. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4214.32s)]
*  The margins are not right. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4215.84s)]
*  Tucker, perfect job. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4217.12s)]
*  Close her up. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4218.08s)]
*  That's using AI. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4220.72s)]
*  While the patient is sedated. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4221.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4223.36s)]
*  Wow. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4224.08s)]
*  That is using AI and that can get breast cancer surgeries [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4224.4s)]
*  to be so prolifically good that the error rate goes to zero. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4229.2s)]
*  The impact on the quality of life of those women and then by extension, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4235.599999999999s)]
*  their families, their kids that have to deal with that stress as well can go away. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4241.28s)]
*  So that's a profound impact of AI that you're going to see in the next year. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4246.08s)]
*  We could quibble that this should have been faster. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4250.24s)]
*  It could have cost a lot less money, meaning it cost me the same amount of money to get [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4252.8s)]
*  this trial done as it costs that Chinese company to build a digital brain that's [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4256.96s)]
*  as good as open AI or Facebook. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4260.64s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4262.08s)]
*  But whatever. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4263.2s)]
*  Okay. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4264.16s)]
*  Put a pin in it. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4264.400000000001s)]
*  We did it. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4265.360000000001s)]
*  We'll file and we'll move forward. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4266.320000000001s)]
*  We play the rules that are on the field, even if the rules make no sense. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4269.68s)]
*  And there's hard to tell anybody change the rules, but it is what it is. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4272.88s)]
*  That's an example. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4276.72s)]
*  Elon published some data yesterday, which is incredibly profound, which is [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4277.92s)]
*  that he has an AI brain inside of the Tesla and the ability to drive safely on the highway [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4282.8s)]
*  became seven and a half X better than his previous version. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4294.4800000000005s)]
*  And his previous version was already 10 times better than a normal car, which means [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4297.92s)]
*  when you get on the highway, you engage FSD, it's called his version of autopilot for the car. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4303.2s)]
*  And it was already 10 times better. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4311.12s)]
*  Now it's seven times better than that. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4313.280000000001s)]
*  10 times to not get into an accident. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4314.96s)]
*  So the idea about using AI now to just eliminate all the unnecessary deaths that happen because [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4320.320000000001s)]
*  of traffic mishaps, there's the potential where that goes to zero. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4326.64s)]
*  That's today as well. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4332.72s)]
*  Again, his issue isn't technological. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4334.56s)]
*  His issue is going to be regulatory. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4337.6s)]
*  At what speed will people be able to be comfortable letting him take people from point A to point B? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4339.44s)]
*  And yet a different example, there are all of these small airplane companies, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4350.16s)]
*  they're called EVTOL. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4356.0s)]
*  So it's not a plane, not a helicopter, but it's kind of this hybrid thing in between. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4357.2s)]
*  And they have this autopilot where it's like taking off and then going back to the airport. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4363.12s)]
*  It's like taking off in a no pilot configuration, piloting it in the air, [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4368.56s)]
*  which is much simpler, by the way, than driving on the ground, and then landing. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4374.4800000000005s)]
*  And you have the ability to now just create a level of transportation which increases GDP. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4379.280000000001s)]
*  And that is an AI brain that's calculating all the system variables around itself, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4385.76s)]
*  being able to fly safely, getting from point A to point B. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4390.8s)]
*  You don't have to drive seven hours. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4394.0s)]
*  It's a 40 minute hop, skip, and a jump now. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4395.44s)]
*  So now go and do your job and come back. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4397.759999999999s)]
*  All of these things are happening right now. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4401.04s)]
*  We are gated on the regulatory machine, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4403.12s)]
*  which are unfortunately not filled with enough actual technologists. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4408.32s)]
*  It's mostly bureaucrats teaching them, getting them comfortable that, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4412.48s)]
*  you know, what do we intend with all of this? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4416.879999999999s)]
*  We intend of reversing this thought lost decade. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4419.44s)]
*  We just want to get to work and build a thing so that America kicks us. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4422.08s)]
*  David Sachs, your cohost, is now the AI czar, also crypto. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4426.08s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4429.919999999999s)]
*  Well, it is amazing. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4430.719999999999s)]
*  He is an amazing human being. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4432.4s)]
*  No, he really is. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4434.879999999999s)]
*  He is a guy. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4435.679999999999s)]
*  I agree. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4436.32s)]
*  I had to teach Sachs how to hug properly. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4437.919999999999s)]
*  Can you show me how you did that? [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4441.759999999999s)]
*  You know, Sachs was a side hugger, which I can't. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4443.36s)]
*  I can see that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4446.799999999999s)]
*  It's like, I'm not a side hugger. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4447.44s)]
*  You're going to give me a hug. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4449.2s)]
*  And we've been really, really close friends for 20 years now. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4450.08s)]
*  So I was like, bro, learn to hug. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4453.6s)]
*  And we have all of these videos where, like, over the course of, like, four years, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4456.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, I had to take his arm and teach how to- [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4461.280000000001s)]
*  You did video training. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4463.280000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4464.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, I had to teach him how to put- [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4464.8s)]
*  No, with him and me, you know, his wife would take a video. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4465.92s)]
*  It's like, Sachs, you got to put your arm this way. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4469.360000000001s)]
*  And then he's like, okay, now you have to, you know, put your head over here. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4472.240000000001s)]
*  He is a brilliant guy. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4476.240000000001s)]
*  So you taught Sachs how to hug. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4479.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4481.52s)]
*  I mean, he taught me everything else, but I taught him how to hug. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4481.76s)]
*  So your show, All In. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4485.280000000001s)]
*  I did it last year. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4488.16s)]
*  I did it because David asked me, and I love David. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4489.76s)]
*  I had no sense of its penetration. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4493.6s)]
*  I had no idea. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4495.84s)]
*  I'm not in business. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4496.56s)]
*  I'm not in technology. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4497.280000000001s)]
*  You know, I drive a stick shift. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4498.96s)]
*  I'm kind of the opposite of that. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4500.08s)]
*  And I just didn't realize- [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4501.68s)]
*  Everybody watches. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4503.280000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4505.12s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4506.16s)]
*  I heard from people I hadn't seen since early childhood. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4507.12s)]
*  I heard from everyone. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4510.56s)]
*  I was stunned by it. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4511.76s)]
*  So what's that like for you? [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4514.24s)]
*  You're obviously well known in Silicon Valley, Facebook, and your investment business. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4516.24s)]
*  But I mean, it's a much larger audience in Silicon Valley. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4523.2s)]
*  So what has that been like? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4526.08s)]
*  I mean, I think it's made me much cooler for my older kids, my teenagers. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4528.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, they use these words, which I just can't stand, but they're like, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4536.08s)]
*  you know, if somebody comes up and says hi, and we take a picture, they're like, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4539.599999999999s)]
*  Dad, that was some good riz. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4542.16s)]
*  Or, you know, they'll be like, yeah, that was okay. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4543.76s)]
*  Good aura, dad. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4546.0s)]
*  Good aura. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4546.88s)]
*  And so we make fun of it. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4548.5599999999995s)]
*  Like, you know, I will turn to them and I'll be like in the car, I'll be like, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4549.76s)]
*  guys, shut up. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4553.12s)]
*  You know, they'll be making a lot of noise. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4554.16s)]
*  They're like, why? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4555.76s)]
*  And then I'll turn up, because I'm a very important podcaster. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4557.12s)]
*  So we get it. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4562.32s)]
*  Did you expect that when you had so like most of the people on the podcast, maybe all are, [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4562.8s)]
*  you know, don't need to be doing podcasts. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4566.72s)]
*  You're not doing it for the money, obviously. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4568.0s)]
*  So this starts as like for fun or why did you, how did you end up doing that? [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4569.6s)]
*  It actually started because our poker game, me, Sax, J Cal, Freeberg, the four co-hosts, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4574.64s)]
*  we were four of the kind of like the regular everyday players. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4582.32s)]
*  When the COVID shelter in place happened, we weren't allowed to go out. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4587.04s)]
*  And so we started to zoom each other. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4592.0s)]
*  And then we just started to record and then we just threw it up on YouTube. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4595.36s)]
*  Because we would, you know, we would ask Freeberg to teach us about the disease and the science of [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4599.12s)]
*  it all. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4603.36s)]
*  Then, you know, we would all take turns riffing on how frustrated we were at Newsome. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4604.16s)]
*  And then we would kind of post it. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4608.96s)]
*  And then it just took on a life of its own. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4610.32s)]
*  And yeah, fast forward four years. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4614.96s)]
*  I mean, we've done, you know, an episode a week. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4616.4s)]
*  I think it had a, we got very lucky because it happened in a moment. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4620.879999999999s)]
*  I think you and Joe Rogan are two of the more leading examples of this, but [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4624.08s)]
*  the traditional media is totally dead. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4632.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4634.24s)]
*  There was a stat today. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4634.8s)]
*  The Washington Post traffic in the last four years has gone from 20 and a half million viewers to [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4636.5599999999995s)]
*  three. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4641.5199999999995s)]
*  Isn't that incredible? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4643.2s)]
*  20 and a half million monthly users to three million. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4644.4s)]
*  So the question is in that vacuum, it's not as if the American population shrank. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4650.08s)]
*  It's grown. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4656.16s)]
*  What is the sense making? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4657.76s)]
*  Or news stopped happening. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4659.84s)]
*  Actually, much more is happening. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4661.28s)]
*  Or did news? [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4662.16s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4662.8s)]
*  More news is happening. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4663.36s)]
*  So I think it's important to rebuild the sense making. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4665.44s)]
*  And I think we accidentally found ourselves making sense of things that are happening [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4668.16s)]
*  to people like explain this technology thing, explain this business thing. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4674.4s)]
*  Explain this political thing, not necessarily so deeply, [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4680.16s)]
*  but connecting the dots so that you could have a slightly better worldview. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4684.88s)]
*  And I think that that's been helpful for people. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4689.2s)]
*  It's been really fun for me. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4691.2s)]
*  Well, apparently. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4692.5599999999995s)]
*  And then Trump comes on. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4694.24s)]
*  I mean, he is really incredible. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4696.4s)]
*  I didn't know what to expect. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4701.679999999999s)]
*  And then David and I threw a fundraiser for him. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4705.44s)]
*  I think part of where all of this started was David called me in June. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4707.599999999999s)]
*  So actually taking a step back, he and I had always been active in politics. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4711.2s)]
*  He was a tried and true conservative from the beginning. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4716.96s)]
*  I was a little bit more promiscuous. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4725.12s)]
*  I didn't really understand how to make my political beliefs fit into one of these vessels. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4726.88s)]
*  But for the most part, in the last few years, like everybody else, I got lulled into buying into a [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4733.6s)]
*  lot of the Democratic lines, and I was a large donor to the Democrats. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4739.120000000001s)]
*  And it all started to unravel for me in 2020 because I didn't understand COVID. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4745.04s)]
*  Then I got the vaccine, only to realize that it was not a vaccine. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4753.76s)]
*  You know, not a vaccine. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4760.24s)]
*  I was really upset. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4762.639999999999s)]
*  A couple of my kids really struggled with what happened to them by not being able to go to school. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4765.76s)]
*  And I was like, why hasn't the government intervened and gotten my kids back in school? [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4771.84s)]
*  All of these things just made me super frustrated. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4777.599999999999s)]
*  So I started to question, maybe I wasn't seeing things right. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4779.5199999999995s)]
*  And maybe I was reacting more with my ego. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4782.8s)]
*  And the answer was, yeah, actually, the Democrats are extremely charming. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4786.5599999999995s)]
*  And they can play a very sophisticated game where they make you feel exclusive. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4791.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's part of the shtick of how they get money from you. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4797.12s)]
*  I would tell these stories as a point of pride. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4800.879999999999s)]
*  Now I tell it as a warning to myself. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4803.2s)]
*  I was sitting at dinner with Obama the day of Brexit. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4805.839999999999s)]
*  And you know that very famous kind of moment where Andrew Carr [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4809.839999999999s)]
*  passed that piece of paper to George Bush? [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4812.879999999999s)]
*  There was a version of that moment, obviously much less important. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4814.88s)]
*  But where somebody passes a note to Obama and he goes, oh my, this was like we were in San [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4818.32s)]
*  Francisco and it was like at 8 or 9 p.m. and he's like, oh wow, the UK just voted to leave. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4824.72s)]
*  So I remember where I was that day. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4831.04s)]
*  But those kinds of moments made me feel that maybe I was doing the right thing, right? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4833.28s)]
*  And then all of my businesses just kept running up against these brick walls. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4840.88s)]
*  Over and over and over again. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4845.4400000000005s)]
*  Every time I tried to do something good that I thought was valuable, [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4847.12s)]
*  it would bump up against all of this stupid regulation and slowed back. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4851.28s)]
*  And every time I looked at who they were, they were all supposedly on the same team that I was in. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4857.12s)]
*  So I said, forget this, I have to start from first principles. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4862.56s)]
*  So in 2023, and Saxon and I decided we're going to start throwing fundraisers [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4866.400000000001s)]
*  for a whole variety of candidates. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4873.5199999999995s)]
*  So the first one was at his house, we threw a fundraiser for RFK. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4876.16s)]
*  We got to meet Bobby. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4879.679999999999s)]
*  It was exhilarating. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4881.28s)]
*  And for the first time you have this person speaking truth to power. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4883.2s)]
*  Then at my house, we threw a fundraiser for Vivek. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  David and I did that together. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4891.599999999999s)]
*  And then David called me and said, let's do a fundraiser for Trump. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4893.679999999999s)]
*  And I said, absolutely. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4896.48s)]
*  And I think that that started the- [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4898.32s)]
*  Did you check with your wife first? [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4899.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4902.24s)]
*  That's quite a statement. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4902.4s)]
*  She's very supportive. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4903.36s)]
*  You know, my wife, she's in the life sciences business. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4905.2s)]
*  But she's always been like, you have to make these decisions, [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4913.04s)]
*  not from how other people will perceive you, but what do you feel? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4919.04s)]
*  And she's like, explain to me Bobby Kennedy, explain to me Vivek, explain to me Donald Trump. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4922.96s)]
*  In your own words, that isn't tied to, well, here's what other people will think of me if I do this. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4928.88s)]
*  And then when I did that, she was like, okay, let's do it. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4932.96s)]
*  Let's do it. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4936.0s)]
*  And I mean, Trump is unbelievably true. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4936.4800000000005s)]
*  But at the time, just for, cause I sort of understand the cultural context. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4940.0s)]
*  No, it was very, it was a very tough moment. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4944.16s)]
*  Kind of ballsy. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4945.92s)]
*  It was very ballsy. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4946.8s)]
*  People, I got the amount of like hate text messages. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4948.08s)]
*  I should have kept some of them. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4950.64s)]
*  They're probably still on my phone actually. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4951.84s)]
*  But people were very mad. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4954.8s)]
*  And part of, I think why they were mad is they were afraid, meaning there was a lie [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4957.2s)]
*  that Biden was sharp as a tack and myself and David had not really dismantled the lie beyond just saying it looks like a lie. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4962.8s)]
*  And I think that they were worried that it would create, I think what Peter Thiel calls this, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4973.599999999999s)]
*  which I really agree with is a preference cascade. [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4977.36s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4979.599999999999s)]
*  You know, like Peter is a genius, but he is on an island many years ahead of the rest of us. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4980.5599999999995s)]
*  Then there are other people, you know, like me and David to some degree, who are also sort of like, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4985.44s)]
*  we can kind of see the patterns, not nearly as fast as a Peter, but then we do a decent job of translating it for other folks. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4990.24s)]
*  So I think people were afraid if these guys translate their interactions with Donald Trump into the truth, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=4998.0s)]
*  it's going to tip a lot of people. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5005.599999999999s)]
*  And they were right. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5006.799999999999s)]
*  Because when Trump came, wow, I mean, like, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5008.32s)]
*  Had you met him before, by the way? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5011.76s)]
*  He had called me. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5013.76s)]
*  So I'd had a telephone conversation. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5015.280000000001s)]
*  So I knew what he was like on the phone. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5016.96s)]
*  That's when I knew I'd made a mistake before about like, believing what the press was saying. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5019.68s)]
*  That's where I went back and I looked at the Charlottesville press conference and I looked at all of them again. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5024.56s)]
*  After my phone call, when the president called me, I was like, hold on a second. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5031.4400000000005s)]
*  This man was a great guy. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5036.64s)]
*  I was like, hold on a second. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5038.48s)]
*  This man was incredibly charming, polite, kind. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5040.96s)]
*  He just like you. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5048.32s)]
*  What I honestly thought, Tucker, I called my wife, I was like, he was raised by really good parents. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5049.84s)]
*  That's what I said to them. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5054.32s)]
*  That's what I said to my wife. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5055.76s)]
*  Because you can tell in your kids, you know, like when you see kids around and there are some, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5057.2s)]
*  they are polite, they're kind, they make eye contact. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5062.639999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5065.68s)]
*  There's these, I don't want to call them simple, but there are these building blocks of being a human being [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5066.0s)]
*  that you need to be taught by your parents. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5073.92s)]
*  He was taught. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5076.32s)]
*  And I have tremendous respect for that. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5077.76s)]
*  So then when I saw him at David's house, I mean, it's like, it's pretty incredible. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5080.32s)]
*  Like it's like a, it's a larger than life figure. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5086.72s)]
*  And he's extemporaneous. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5091.04s)]
*  He talks for an hour and a half. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5092.4s)]
*  He's going all over the place. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5093.92s)]
*  He's doing the weave, you know, it's incredible. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5095.04s)]
*  And so I was hilarious too. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5100.0s)]
*  He's very funny. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5101.68s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5102.64s)]
*  Which is really hard to be actually. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5102.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5104.88s)]
*  And so I walked away thinking, wow, I had got it totally wrong. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5105.5199999999995s)]
*  And I was lied to. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5111.68s)]
*  And I believed at a very superficial level, what the mainstream media was saying. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5113.04s)]
*  And then I did even more research. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5119.28s)]
*  You know, I read the lawsuits. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5121.04s)]
*  And it was just the amount of contortion that people were going through to try to [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5123.36s)]
*  prevent this man from getting into power made me want him to be in power even more. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5129.599999999999s)]
*  Because I thought they're afraid of something that's something they're not going to say out [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5135.28s)]
*  loud, but that is the thing that we need to exercise from the U S government. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5140.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5143.759999999999s)]
*  That, that thing that they want to protect. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5144.32s)]
*  Nicely put. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5146.08s)]
*  That's right. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5146.48s)]
*  It's not even now clear exactly. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5147.44s)]
*  It's just it's disclosure of some kind. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5148.799999999999s)]
*  They fear being, you know, revealed, but yeah, that's as far as that. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5150.88s)]
*  And then, and then, you know, different from his first time around, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5155.92s)]
*  the caliber of the people around him, it's like, it's like the 92 Barcelona, [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5160.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, dream team. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5165.12s)]
*  As far as I can tell, I mean, like, my gosh, like you get Elon, you get Vivek, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5166.72s)]
*  you get RFK, you get Tulsi, you get all of these people, you know, Howard Lutnick. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5171.52s)]
*  David Sacks. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5176.400000000001s)]
*  David Sacks, Scott Bessent. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5177.12s)]
*  This is, this is amazing. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5179.84s)]
*  I want to tell you about an amazing documentary series from our friend, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5181.28s)]
*  Sean Stone called All the President's Men, the Conspiracy Against Trump. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5185.2s)]
*  It is a series of interviews with people at the very heart of the first Trump term, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5189.2s)]
*  many of whom are close to the heart of the second Trump term. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5195.04s)]
*  This is their stories about what permanent Washington tried to do to them, [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5198.8s)]
*  in many cases, send them to prison for the crime of supporting Donald Trump. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5202.96s)]
*  Their words have never been more relevant than they are now. [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5206.56s)]
*  Steve Bannon, Cash Patel, I'm in there even. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5209.360000000001s)]
*  All the President's Men, the Conspiracy Against Trump, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5211.76s)]
*  and you will find it only on TCNTuckerCarlson.com. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5214.64s)]
*  Highly recommended. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5218.160000000001s)]
*  So what is the view, I remember that I remember vividly the day that you all had that fundraiser [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5228.160000000001s)]
*  for Trump and thinking, this is, I never thought I would live to see this. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5233.2s)]
*  This is like a major change, major, major change. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5237.36s)]
*  Was there a major change in attitudes in Silicon Valley toward Trump after that? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5240.16s)]
*  After that, yeah, because it gave permission. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5243.84s)]
*  David is very complimentary to me in that, because I was a little bit more [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5246.5599999999995s)]
*  promiscuous and not necessarily just a straight, hardline Republican, [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5254.88s)]
*  it was a little bit more valuable, I think, for that cohort of people, [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5260.24s)]
*  because they could kind of say, oh, well, if it's, you know, Jamal said it, then yeah, sure. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5265.12s)]
*  But I think that he probably took a lot of heat as well. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5270.32s)]
*  And more than that, what he did was he then said, you know, I'm really going to put my foot on the [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5274.5599999999995s)]
*  gas here. And he's great at this, which is just like, I'm going to tip the preference cascade. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5279.679999999999s)]
*  So then he went to the Republican convention. He spoke. He, you know, he did a lot. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5284.72s)]
*  And his wife did a lot there. That's a real dynamic power couple, those two. [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5290.08s)]
*  And then Mark Andreessen came out. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5294.16s)]
*  And then Andreessen came out. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5296.0s)]
*  And it was funny, like the Andreessen thing was so a little bit interesting. I don't think the full [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5299.76s)]
*  detail. So I'm just speculating, but, you know, it did turn out that his partner also gave like 50 or [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5305.12s)]
*  100 million bucks to Kamala, which I suspect then that Mark probably gave 50 or 100 million to Trump. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5309.84s)]
*  It looked like they were splitting it. Yeah. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5316.24s)]
*  So what was it like though, living there, living in, you know, among the people you work with and [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5320.8s)]
*  have worked with, like how did people treat you? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5327.360000000001s)]
*  There was an initial part where people do this, you know? [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5330.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5332.56s)]
*  And I felt that because I'm very sensitive to that. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5335.2s)]
*  You know? And my feelings get hurt. And I get super annoyed by it. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5337.599999999999s)]
*  I think you call it the private equity wives for me. It was like the private equity husbands as well. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5343.92s)]
*  That's really shameful. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5348.5599999999995s)]
*  They all just like kind of like a scowl. And then after the election, it was more like a, [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5350.4s)]
*  and I'm like, what changed? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5356.4s)]
*  I've felt that across the country. What is, how would you describe that? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5359.599999999999s)]
*  I think a lot of people are not necessarily fighting a moral or ideological battle, Tucker. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5362.32s)]
*  I think people are just trying to get from one day to the next day. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5373.2s)]
*  For sure. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5376.08s)]
*  And I respect that. At first I was hurt by it because I didn't understand it. And I thought, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5377.2s)]
*  again, it goes back to, oh, I'm worthless. Like, is there something about me? Is that why you're [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5384.0s)]
*  rejecting me? And then I realized it has nothing to do with me. This person is just, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5387.92s)]
*  today is a day, tomorrow is a day. And they're not fighting these battles. It doesn't make them [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5391.84s)]
*  better nor worse. It's just a different. For me, I'm caught up in my own head about having to [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5398.4800000000005s)]
*  do something a little bit more ideological and morally rooted because I need that so that I [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5407.28s)]
*  feel like there's purpose. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5413.84s)]
*  Of course. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5415.4400000000005s)]
*  Not everybody's built that way. And I wasn't built that way. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5416.0s)]
*  People are distracted by their day-to-day concerns. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5419.36s)]
*  And I think that that's very fair. So, I kind of leave it to them as what they are. I think [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5422.32s)]
*  it's good that their minds are open and their eyes are open. So the way that this is going to [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5427.04s)]
*  be really tested now is what's happening in California. If you look at the Palisades, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5431.84s)]
*  which is an incredibly affluent area. [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5438.0s)]
*  Yeah. Beautiful place. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5440.08s)]
*  Beautiful place. And it's just been decimated. And several of my very good friends lost their [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5441.04s)]
*  homes there. They were tried and true Democrats. It didn't matter what the candidate's name was [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5446.0s)]
*  beside the box in the ballot. They checked it and they moved on. And now the real test for them is [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5456.0s)]
*  what do they do? Will they look through the label and actually look at the policies and ask, [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5462.0s)]
*  did these help or hurt me? All of these things that I give money to, all these NGOs and nonprofits, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5468.96s)]
*  did they help or hurt me? California has a $322 billion a year budget. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5475.92s)]
*  Do I as a taxpayer who pays some of the highest taxes in the nation have a right to ask where [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5483.76s)]
*  that money is being spent? And if the answer to all those questions is it doesn't matter, [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5490.4s)]
*  check the box, then we deserve what we get in California. But it can be much better [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5496.32s)]
*  because today the state is totally broken. We have lost the script. We don't prioritize [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5502.5599999999995s)]
*  California's economic supremacy nor its technological supremacy. That is a huge mistake [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5509.759999999999s)]
*  when you look at the number of companies that have left the state, Oracle, Tesla, Chevron. I mean, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5518.48s)]
*  this is not like just fringe businesses. These are the businesses that matter. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5525.68s)]
*  And they're voting with their feet. I mean, it does feel like the tipping point is here though. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5531.84s)]
*  I mean, you said that we're- I would not underestimate the democratic machine. It's [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5537.28s)]
*  a cartel that runs that state. Oh, I know. And Gavin Newsom is extremely charismatic [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5542.64s)]
*  and he is able to convince people of things that are just not true. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5549.12s)]
*  And so he is fighting for his political life. He definitely wants to be on the national stage. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5557.92s)]
*  And so the real question is, is he able to convince enough people that this was the [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5566.4s)]
*  environment and that these winds came out of nowhere? Or will it be laid bare at his feet [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5571.76s)]
*  that it was just a lack of skill, intellectual rigor and distraction and negligence [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5579.52s)]
*  and incompetence that caused this fire? I mean, I think you make a pretty strong case for the latter. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5586.96s)]
*  I found that there were three bills that started in the legislature that were either approved [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5594.72s)]
*  by the legislature and were then vetoed by Newsom or were then pulled down by the legislature [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5601.6s)]
*  itself. Again, this is like Democrats on Democrat violence to just give a waiver to all of these [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5606.400000000001s)]
*  local municipalities to go and clear the brush. Just that, clear the brush. Now, would that have [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5614.400000000001s)]
*  stopped the fire? No, I get that it wouldn't have stopped the fire, but the intensity of a fire is [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5621.4400000000005s)]
*  directly proportional to the energy load that you give it. To the fuel, of course. So take away some [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5626.4800000000005s)]
*  of the fuel and the fire will be less. And if we can't even admit that plain truth, this is what I [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5631.28s)]
*  mean by if we're going to continue to just lie to ourselves because we care so much about this failed [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5636.24s)]
*  ideology, then California is going to just continue to just degrade. But there's a point, I mean, [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5641.36s)]
*  you see the same thing in New York City where if the engines of the economy leave, because it is [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5646.719999999999s)]
*  a country with 50 states, there's a point where the math doesn't work and things just decline so [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5653.84s)]
*  quickly that it's hard to recover. It is true, but the thing that is important to keep in mind about [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5660.32s)]
*  California is sometimes you get lucky. And we have to acknowledge our luck, but not fritter it away. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5666.96s)]
*  Specifically in California, there is a critical mass of these 50,000 Michael Jordan engineers. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5674.16s)]
*  Yes. You cannot rebuild Silicon Valley by casting it to the four winds. Some people go to Prioria, [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5680.799999999999s)]
*  Illinois. Some people end up in Boston. Some are in Miami. Some are in Las Vegas. Some are in Austin. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5688.56s)]
*  All fine and good. But that is not the place or the way to create the technical vibrancy we need [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5694.64s)]
*  to generate technical supremacy. You need these people close and around you so that they're [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5701.84s)]
*  pollinating from each other. And this is again where why hasn't the state realized that? That [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5707.280000000001s)]
*  is an incredibly critical resource. Well, at this point with the decline of [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5712.24s)]
*  ag and the entertainment business and aerospace, I don't really know what drives the economy of [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5719.28s)]
*  California other than technology. Well, right now, if you look at California's employment, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5724.96s)]
*  the employment picture is quite scary because it is government jobs that are convoluting how [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5730.96s)]
*  healthy the actual state is. So if you take away the government jobs, but at the end of the day, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5736.0s)]
*  what do government bureaucrats do? They want to govern. How do they do that? They're going to [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5741.12s)]
*  legislate or they're going to regulate. Where is that felt? It's felt on private industry and [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5746.48s)]
*  private citizens. But eventually at the limit, the amount of regulation goes to infinity and [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5752.24s)]
*  they're legislating themselves into oblivion. Nobody will be there to legislate, to be governed [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5757.84s)]
*  by all of this insanity because everybody will leave. And first, the people that leave are the [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5763.44s)]
*  people that can leave. Then the people that leave are the people that have to leave. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5769.6s)]
*  And we're in the first part. It's clear the people that- [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5775.120000000001s)]
*  Do you know people who've left? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5777.76s)]
*  Many, many, many, many. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5779.120000000001s)]
*  Have you thought about it? [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5780.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, look, again, I'll tell you in terms of my poker game, half of those people that have [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5781.68s)]
*  been my lifelong friends for 20 years have left, half. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5787.76s)]
*  Where'd they go? [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5791.120000000001s)]
*  Austin, Miami- [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5792.4800000000005s)]
*  Texas and Florida. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5795.52s)]
*  Yeah, Texas and Florida. And it's just so frustrating. And they've left because they [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5796.48s)]
*  can't build things. The taxes were like secondary. One of my friends left because [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5803.28s)]
*  one of their children went through a bit of an identity crisis, if you want to call it that. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5811.36s)]
*  And the police showed up and wanted to take the kid away [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5818.48s)]
*  so that the kid could go through a transition that the kid ultimately decided they didn't want to go [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5821.919999999999s)]
*  through. The police showed up? [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5826.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah. That's the law in California. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5829.04s)]
*  So they can encourage it? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5831.36s)]
*  I'm not sure if it's to encourage it, but my understanding of the way this works is if you [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5833.04s)]
*  as a child have these issues and you escalate that, there is a requirement for the school to [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5837.599999999999s)]
*  basically call Child Protective Services, who may or may not call the police, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5845.919999999999s)]
*  who may or may not come to your house and try to take the kid away. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5849.44s)]
*  So they're not your children in California is basically what they're saying. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5855.919999999999s)]
*  Well, they're your children to the point where the government believes that they know better. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5859.44s)]
*  Man, that's just, I mean, any government that presumes to know better than parents [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5863.5199999999995s)]
*  is an out of control, scary government. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5868.4s)]
*  I mean, look, I try to think of myself as a good parent. I try to do the best I can. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5870.639999999999s)]
*  Do I make mistakes? Yeah, sure. But am I generally more [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5875.2s)]
*  better for my kids than some other random adult? Also, yeah. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5879.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, strongly. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5884.799999999999s)]
*  Right. And so like the idea that just some random person in an office somewhere [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5885.679999999999s)]
*  can read some piece of paper and all of a sudden take your kids away. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5890.08s)]
*  Hey, that's very scary. It's very scary. It makes me feel very insecure of that idea. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5893.36s)]
*  What's keeping you there? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5898.0s)]
*  I'm very stubborn and I feel very grateful. I feel very grateful to America. I feel very [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5899.44s)]
*  grateful to California. It gave me a path that I would not have had anywhere else. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5907.44s)]
*  And so I have a responsibility to stay and fix it. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5917.44s)]
*  Good for you. I feel guilty that I left. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5922.4s)]
*  Good for you. I feel guilty that I left. Because it's the prettiest state. I mean, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5925.36s)]
*  nothing comes close. So to get driven out of where you grew up and where your ancestors lived is [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5931.599999999999s)]
*  pretty, it's better, but I did it. So does it change? Does the state change? It's a one-party [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5936.5599999999995s)]
*  state. Clearly it's enormously corrupt, as you know, and wasteful. And now it's fallen down on [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5942.799999999999s)]
*  its most basic obligation, which is to keep your house from burning down. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5949.12s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5952.0s)]
*  So does that force change politically? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5952.56s)]
*  I think people need to force the change now. It has to force change. People have to understand [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5958.240000000001s)]
*  that these labels mean nothing. Meaning you could have the smartest person in the world and the [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5965.52s)]
*  dumbest person in the world. You cannot vote for the dumbest person in the world just because the [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5971.04s)]
*  label beside them is something you've been told is wrong. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5974.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5978.320000000001s)]
*  That is just the height of stupidity. It's not what you're allowed to do as an adult. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5978.96s)]
*  Adults aren't allowed to do that. Your kids can do that. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5984.32s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5987.12s)]
*  And you're supposed to teach your kids that that's not how you make decisions when you're [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5987.6s)]
*  an adult. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5991.36s)]
*  On the basis of labels, brands. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5991.92s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5994.08s)]
*  It's childish. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5994.96s)]
*  There are some really competent people that are in that state that will [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=5996.64s)]
*  try now to come out of the woodwork to do the right thing, to deregulate California. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6001.36s)]
*  California has 60,000 regulations on the books. It was 10,000 less than a decade ago. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6009.04s)]
*  Go back to 10,000. Go to 5,000. What are we afraid of? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6015.92s)]
*  Are we afraid of the breast cancer thing that could get to market faster? [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6021.2s)]
*  Are you afraid that Elon's autopilot can now save people's lives more? [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6024.8s)]
*  Are you afraid that we can catch rockets and then send them back to the stars and the heavens and [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6029.92s)]
*  Mars? Why is that bad? [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6037.68s)]
*  Well, the point of regulation is to encourage guarantee, health and safety. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6039.599999999999s)]
*  Growing up in California, it was a healthy state. It was the healthiest state, as far as I could [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6047.68s)]
*  tell. It was a very safe state. It's neither one of those things. It's one of the least healthy [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6052.0s)]
*  states. Actually, there's more poverty in California than any state. Autism rates are [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6056.8s)]
*  the highest in the country. It's dangerous in a lot of ways. It's not working. I guess that's [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6060.16s)]
*  what I would say. The regulations aren't working. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6065.84s)]
*  This is my point. It's not working. How long do well-heeled democratic voters need to see their [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6066.72s)]
*  state run over, need to see their lives ruined, and now their kids' lives ruined? Maybe this is [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6074.08s)]
*  the thing that actually- Well, you tell me you live among them. Do you see the change coming? [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6079.2s)]
*  I don't see the change coming. So, not where I live, because the only damage that has ever happened [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6083.12s)]
*  in Silicon Valley is economic damage, but then it's righted itself. And so, people just go and [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6093.12s)]
*  move along blindly in the orthodoxy. It's only when your business is at risk where you'll flip. So, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6101.36s)]
*  you know, you've seen kind of like Metta have a total, you know, come to Jesus moment. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6107.28s)]
*  Yeah. What's that? Have you talked to Zuckerberg about it? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6112.08s)]
*  No, Mark and I had, you know, I gave this speech at Stanford in 2016, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6115.76s)]
*  which went pretty viral, which kind of laid bare what was going on in social media. And he and I [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6121.68s)]
*  have not spoken since. Wow. [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6126.4s)]
*  Yeah. Well, knowing him as you do and for as long as you have, what do you make of his Joe Rogan [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6128.5599999999995s)]
*  appearance? I think it's a calculation to manage [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6134.0s)]
*  the conditions on the field. Meaning, what I said on the pod is all you need to know are two things. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6138.24s)]
*  One is there's an incredible picture in Donald Trump's book, which is a picture of Zuck sitting [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6147.5199999999995s)]
*  in the oval. And by the way, this is the same book which you have to get. It's the book where like, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6155.84s)]
*  you know, he talks about, you know, Trudeau's mom kind of like casting about what the Rolling Stone [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6161.36s)]
*  and like, you know, not just casting about rolling about, rolling about and like, you know, he's like [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6166.88s)]
*  Fidel Castro's love child anyways, but in that book is a picture of Zuck and it says, you know, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6171.28s)]
*  Zuck was the nicest guy to my face, but then would, you know, work against me to turn over the [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6175.2s)]
*  election. And, you know, I've made it very clear that if he tries to do anything like that again, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6179.28s)]
*  he'll go to prison for the rest of his life. That's what, that's what Trump says in the [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6185.6s)]
*  caption. And then he was asked about that last week, the exact same day that Metta changed their [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6189.68s)]
*  policies. And he said, do you think it was in response to what you said? And the president said, [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6195.04s)]
*  probably. So I think it's a very smart, but necessary set of calculations, but I think they [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6200.0s)]
*  are calculations. So what are his highest values? What are his first principles? Zuck? Yep. I mean, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6206.56s)]
*  I'd only be guessing. But an informed guess since you know him. You know, I think that he, he's a, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6213.5199999999995s)]
*  well, I think that he's a very big fan of the Roman empire. If I had to translate and guess how [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6220.0s)]
*  that manifests in his day-to-day decision-making, I think he thinks of things empirically, meaning [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6228.56s)]
*  like as an empire. And he has an empire. You know, he has Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, you know, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6235.6s)]
*  Messenger. These are institutional worldwide products in the, in the digital sphere. He is Rome. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6243.679999999999s)]
*  And so I think that he cares about the propagation of that empire, probably more than he cares about [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6255.92s)]
*  any philosophical trends per se, because, you know, the, the empire endured by the Roman empire. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6263.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, the, the empire endures if you can, you know, manage the vicissitudes of trends. That's [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6271.36s)]
*  right. So when the trend was under the Democrats to build a censorship machine, you know, you do [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6276.88s)]
*  that. And then when the trend is to do the opposite, you'll do the opposite. But he said to me a number [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6283.599999999999s)]
*  of times and over a number of years, you know, off camera, but has said, you know, basically I'm a [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6289.04s)]
*  kind of seventies liberal and I really believe in free speech. You think that's true? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6295.68s)]
*  Sure. I think that that's not the question. Apparently not. He has, you know, he controls [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6302.72s)]
*  Facebook with an iron fist. He has complete voting control. He has less economic participation, but, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6311.12s)]
*  you know, he has, he has absolute power. And that was the justification in some ways of explaining [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6317.52s)]
*  how he made these changes. Now it doesn't explain why it veered in the other direction then. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6325.2s)]
*  And I think it's important to just probably get the answer to that. And then you'll know where he [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6333.04s)]
*  stands, you know, meaning the, the economic power has ebbed and flowed, but the absolute power has [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6336.8s)]
*  never changed. So, you know, the philosophy that he believed in then, if it's the same now, then the [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6342.0s)]
*  question is, well, why did the manifestation of that power change? Well, he's basically said, you [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6348.16s)]
*  know, he's bullied by the national security state. I can believe that too, by the way, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6352.64s)]
*  I'm sympathetic to that. I mean, that's got to feel like a lot of pressure when you're a young [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6356.240000000001s)]
*  guy on the come up and a bunch of these well-heeled politicos show up at your office and say, you know, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6359.84s)]
*  bend the knee. Why don't you go fuck yourself? That's what I would say. Maybe that's why I'm [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6365.04s)]
*  not a billionaire, but I, I it's, it's like unbelievable that happens in this country. It's [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6369.280000000001s)]
*  like shocking. There are, there are billionaires that I've said, go fuck yourself. Yeah, I know. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6374.96s)]
*  Elon's- And they, and they, and they've become, you know, even more successful as a result. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6378.96s)]
*  So- I mean, Richard Spahn, the world did that. So what is his role in Elon's role in the, [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6382.5599999999995s)]
*  in the new administration, do you think? I think he's the heartbeat. Here's what I mean by that. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6387.5199999999995s)]
*  I've thought about this. It is the most important temperature check that we are going to [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6392.88s)]
*  make the changes that Donald Trump wants. Meaning, I think the president [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6400.8s)]
*  in some ways is the most powerful job, but he, but I think this second term, he's more of a vessel [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6404.0s)]
*  in the sense that he's got all of these great field generals who can now run the place. And of all the [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6409.2s)]
*  field generals, the one that has just an incremental more degree of freedom to also communicate openly [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6416.64s)]
*  and continuously with the public is him. So you'll get a sense of whether there's an arrhythmia by [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6424.88s)]
*  just monitoring his ex-feed. You'll also get a sense of whether there's like a, you know, like [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6430.4800000000005s)]
*  if the drum beat is building, I think you get a sense of that from Elon as well. I think he is the, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6437.4400000000005s)]
*  he's the heartbeat. So do you think that Elon's ex-feed is a kind of pretty accurate window into [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6442.8s)]
*  what he's thinking? Yeah. And that, that's what's so powerful. And this is why I think, you know, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6448.320000000001s)]
*  when you compare and contrast Zuck with Elon, it's, I think Zuck is the most powerful, [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6452.64s)]
*  it's, I think Zuck is like every other CEO. And Elon is just a complete singular outlier in the [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6458.24s)]
*  sense that there is no book that would have told you just tell the truth grounded in your morality [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6467.44s)]
*  from day one and just burn the boats. You know, that old Cortez line, right? Oh, of course. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6474.96s)]
*  And people would have said, what? And so whatever he's felt he's shared in complete truth and candor, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6482.08s)]
*  no other CEO has ever done that. And probably no one will ever will because you can't do it as a [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6490.72s)]
*  strategy and you can't implement it on day 17 or day 1004. It's you either are or you're not. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6495.5199999999995s)]
*  And so he sets a way of behavior that future CEOs should emulate, [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6504.5599999999995s)]
*  but we also have to a little bit give a break and cut some slack to everybody else because they're [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6511.2s)]
*  just never going to do as good a job as him in doing that. How was he seen in Silicon Valley? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6515.44s)]
*  Oh, he's a star. He, but he's a kind guy. Like, I mean, you know him as well, but like, [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6521.44s)]
*  know him as well, but like, this, I just, I think that people should know this. Like this is a kind, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6526.08s)]
*  he's a kind guy. He's like, he's a beautiful person. He's a kind guy. I don't know what to [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6533.68s)]
*  say. Like, has any American ever had this much power? Gosh. Meaning like the intersection of [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6539.2s)]
*  private and public industry kind of thing. Yeah. I just, I can't think of, I mean, of course, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6553.28s)]
*  the president has the power to launch nuclear weapons. So that, that trumps all power, but, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6557.44s)]
*  but as a private citizen, non a non-president, I can't think of any time in 250 years where an [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6561.92s)]
*  American has had as much power as Elon Musk has in the sense that, you know, he's the most successful [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6568.8s)]
*  businessman by many measures. He runs the most powerful media outlet in the world, which is X. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6573.28s)]
*  And he has, you know, this mandate from the newly elected president of the United States to, [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6580.240000000001s)]
*  to change the government. I mean, I don't just, nothing like that has ever happened that I know [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6584.88s)]
*  of. Yeah. It's like, yeah. I mean, I guess so. You know, I guess it hasn't happened. Why did he buy X? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6588.08s)]
*  Cause as a business decision, it's kind of hard to justify. Well, there's like, it happened in a [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6601.360000000001s)]
*  moment where I think that there was the intersection of a lot of free speech issues. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6607.12s)]
*  And I just think like there was like some, you know, stuff that I'm not going to get into, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6619.44s)]
*  but like personal stuff, I think probably in his own life. And it's just like made him question [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6623.28s)]
*  like, what, what are these philosophies? What are these ideologies and how destructive are they? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6627.92s)]
*  If we can't, if we, if we can't question things and talk out loud. And so we all got very lucky. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6633.84s)]
*  He paid the personal, this is what I mean, but like, like everybody can be like, wow, it's so [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6641.2s)]
*  easy. It must be amazing. It's not so that that's like, I would crumble under the weight of that. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6645.599999999999s)]
*  I don't think I'm capable of that. I know that about myself. My God. And like the price you pay, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6650.719999999999s)]
*  the personal price you pay, I couldn't do it. I think it's a, he's a unique person that way. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6655.92s)]
*  His capacity for pain, his capacity for just, just the sheer grudgery, like just drudgery, like just, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6664.72s)]
*  it's incredible. I've never seen anything. I've never seen anything like it. I mean, [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6675.04s)]
*  I guess in this context, you know, I've been around two of these incredible figures, Mark, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6678.56s)]
*  I worked in the trenches with. Elon, I've seen now for 15 plus years. And I, when you think about [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6684.32s)]
*  those two, yeah, with Elon, there's just an incredible intellectual curiosity, [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6690.719999999999s)]
*  an incredible amount of ability to suffer pain and suffering. And yet he's incredibly kind. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6698.32s)]
*  I don't know how. He also seems to, I don't understand how he does everything. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6706.4s)]
*  How do you tweet that much, run that many companies also have that many children also, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6714.719999999999s)]
*  you know, he's a gamer, I guess. Like what, like, how does that work? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6721.2s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. Like, I mean, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6725.84s)]
*  As a scheduling matter. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6726.719999999999s)]
*  I know exactly. I look, I got here last night, ate at the pink elephant and went to bed and I felt [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6727.679999999999s)]
*  guilty. I thought, you know, shouldn't I be doing more yesterday? I really thought that, you know, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6735.759999999999s)]
*  and I saw my email kind of piling up and I, and I used you as an excuse. Oh, I have to be fresh [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6742.96s)]
*  for Tucker. Good night. That's what I did. So you're right. And then I think, okay, I'm operating [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6749.68s)]
*  across an investment portfolio and one company that I run very intensely. How do you do that? [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6758.4s)]
*  Multiply by seven and all of these other, I don't know how you do it. I really don't know Tucker. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6766.32s)]
*  I wish that there was an answer, but I also think it's not the right thing to answer in the sense [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6770.64s)]
*  that we're all going to give some glib answer and then everybody's going to try to run and copy it. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6777.04s)]
*  And I think what you forget is he is the product of 20 years of preparation. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6781.12s)]
*  He started with one company, then he's that two companies. Do you know what I mean? Like, [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6790.96s)]
*  so these are reps upon reps upon reps upon reps over decades. And I think it's important to keep [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6796.4800000000005s)]
*  that in mind. Like that is a level of skill. Like he is demonstrating human peak level performance. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6806.240000000001s)]
*  It's easier to observe it in maybe an athlete or something else, but that's what he's demonstrating. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6814.0s)]
*  He is at the peak of human intellect. That is the brain unencumbered by all the other [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6819.76s)]
*  stuff that maybe a lot of us get caught up in. Well, that's the other thing is he's given up [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6827.280000000001s)]
*  possessions effectively. Great idea. Yeah, it is. I mean, it's not, I've never. He tweeted out like, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6831.360000000001s)]
*  there's all these things I've never, I never tell him these things, but like there are things that [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6838.56s)]
*  he's, that's why I follow him because part of it is like, I get things from him in Twitter that [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6841.84s)]
*  really profoundly affect my life. So when I was going through all of that turbulence in 2022, you [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6848.24s)]
*  know, he tweeted out, I think it was in 21. I can't remember when it was, but he's like, I've just [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6853.44s)]
*  sold all my homes and possessions. And I went back immediately. I thought of that is the one thing [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6858.48s)]
*  that I was taught as a Buddhist when I was raised Buddhist, you know, and despite all the stuff and [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6865.04s)]
*  all the anger that I had, and I never thought that Buddhism was all that effective or useful for me. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6870.719999999999s)]
*  I took one lesson, detach yourself from the physical world. Yes. And I saw it and I connected [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6875.92s)]
*  that dot to myself and I said, I am the opposite of that. It's totally true. I am totally, totally, [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6883.12s)]
*  totally attached to the physical world. I keep a verse on my phone. I'm not a great [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6890.4800000000005s)]
*  Bible scholar, hardly, but I do keep this verse because I think it actually, I mean, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6895.04s)]
*  it's one John three, do not love this world or the things that offers you for when you love the world, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6902.32s)]
*  you don't have the love of the father in you for the world offers only a craving for physical [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6907.68s)]
*  pleasure, a craving for everything we see and a pride in our achievements and possessions. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6912.24s)]
*  Right. These are from the world and the world is fading away along with everything that people crave. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6917.28s)]
*  There you go. Christian, not Buddhist, but same idea and true. Same idea, same idea. And so he [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6924.88s)]
*  tweets that out. He sold all of his houses, he sells all of his possessions. And I'm like, [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6930.16s)]
*  what am I doing? I'm buying more. Yeah. I'm like, oh, I'm going to take delivery of this thing and [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6938.08s)]
*  this other thing. And now I have to hire people to manage the things. And I'm like, what am I, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6943.76s)]
*  what am I doing? Yes. So that helped me a lot. I've never told, I never told, but yeah, these [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6947.599999999999s)]
*  things. So he is an incredible, I think, guidepost on how to clarify your own intentions. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6954.88s)]
*  If you're willing to see through it all and clarify that message, that would be a thing that [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6966.08s)]
*  I think he's an incredible exemplar of. Find the thing that you care about and then just double [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6970.24s)]
*  and triple and quadruple and quintuple down on that thing. That is exactly right. That is exactly [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6976.72s)]
*  right. So speaking of bookends, we began this conversation with your description of your, [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6980.48s)]
*  I hate the word journey, but it is a journey to like a much higher level of self-awareness and [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6986.32s)]
*  peace. And you're ending by describing, you know, with admiration, Elon's decision to detach himself [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6991.28s)]
*  from the world, even as he engages in the things that he really loves. Do you think that there is a [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=6998.4s)]
*  greater spiritual awareness, a greater hunger in Silicon Valley where it matters because of the [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7004.5599999999995s)]
*  richest people in the country than there was? You said, you know, no one believes in God. Do [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7008.4s)]
*  you think that's changing? No, but I think we need to make it more fashionable to be spiritual. [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7013.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, you don't think it's changing? I don't think it's changing yet. I think that a lot of this [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7018.4s)]
*  extreme wealth was created in people that are in their thirties, some in their twenties. Many of [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7023.36s)]
*  them are in their forties. And I think that in over this next 10 or 15 years, there's going to [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7029.759999999999s)]
*  be a crisis of identity when they realized that, you know, they were playing dumb games, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7035.04s)]
*  focused on superficial things beyond the companies themselves, and that there's a bigger [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7041.2s)]
*  purpose, right? There needs to be a loyalty to country, loyalty to the state, loyalty to the [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7047.04s)]
*  people around you that you don't even know, not to virtue signal, but to actually just do the hard [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7052.48s)]
*  practical work. Part of that is rooted, I think, in a spirituality. That's not there yet. But [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7057.28s)]
*  I think that it will become cool again. It can become cool again. I believe in God. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7062.72s)]
*  And the reason I believe in God, and if I were to tell my friends in Silicon Valley, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7073.76s)]
*  the way that I would incept this idea would be purely from a scientific lens, [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7078.16s)]
*  which is, if you believe it is true, which I think most people do, that there is a finite [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7084.32s)]
*  moment in which the universe began, explain not the process, but explain the moment, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7093.28s)]
*  and you cannot. And it is an endless rabbit hole that if you spend your time in the universe, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7102.799999999999s)]
*  and you cannot, and it is an endless rabbit hole that if you spend your time, [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7109.2s)]
*  and again, when I was feeling very empty, that's where I started. And I read all about Islam, [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7115.68s)]
*  I read about Christianity, I read about Judaism, I reread about Buddhism, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7122.32s)]
*  and the only explanation is God. And I think that that's a way where people there can be, [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7128.5599999999995s)]
*  they'll let their guard down. Because if you start a conversation about physics and cosmology, [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7138.72s)]
*  and people are very open-minded, and then you go, well, how did it happen? How did t [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7143.6s)]
*  equal zero happen? What does t minus one look like? And their brains explode. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7148.0s)]
*  Why? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7152.320000000001s)]
*  Their brains truly explode because people that are very good technologically in that way, [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7152.56s)]
*  are very good at getting to explanations. And they're very good at kind of like breaking [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7157.76s)]
*  things down. I know it's used a lot now, but into first principles. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7162.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7164.8s)]
*  There is no first principles explanation for how the universe began. There is none. Don't tell me [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7166.8s)]
*  about the Big Bang Theory. It doesn't work. Don't tell me about general relativity, because it all [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7172.08s)]
*  breaks. We have to make these profound assumptions in math and physics to make it all hang together. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7177.2s)]
*  Because you cannot tell me what t equals zero right at that moment. How? Nobody can answer the [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7184.64s)]
*  how. No. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7193.92s)]
*  And so then if you look at this entire lived world around you, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7195.360000000001s)]
*  I don't know, I just I am filled with this immense gratitude. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7200.56s)]
*  And then I think it must be God. And that gives me like, it gives me something. I didn't have that [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7206.96s)]
*  before. And so I take that. I'm not trying to push that on other people, but that works for me. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7213.84s)]
*  You know, makes me a better husband, makes me a better dad, it makes me a better friend. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7220.4s)]
*  I do things now that I, you know, when, when the fires were happening, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7225.04s)]
*  you know, my friends, I just round robin, I just kept calling them every day to check in on them. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7231.599999999999s)]
*  That's a small thing, right? But these are values that I had lost somewhere along the way were, [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7237.839999999999s)]
*  you know, just like, just calling people caring about people. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7244.8s)]
*  One of my friends lost the home I spent an entire afternoon, not an entire afternoon, [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7251.4400000000005s)]
*  sorry, again, I don't want to overplay it. I spent like an hour or so going through all my [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7256.240000000001s)]
*  Google photos, clicking through and finding all the photos of him our friends, so that we can make [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7260.400000000001s)]
*  him an album. Because he lost everything. And yeah, you get the clothes, whatever. But you know, [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7265.92s)]
*  these picture albums, you know, they mean a lot. And I was happy. And I felt really [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7271.92s)]
*  like a useful, good person at the end of that. Yes. I don't know. That's, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7280.08s)]
*  I got that from believing in God. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7285.12s)]
*  And my final question is, are you hopeful, since we are at a moment of real change in the country, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7290.32s)]
*  are you hopeful for the future? Yeah. I think there is, we were, we had a fever. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7296.8s)]
*  And that fever has broken. And what has to lie in its place are examples of how all of these things [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7306.0s)]
*  that we thought we were not allowed to do, when we do them actually work, meaning, we're actually [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7316.88s)]
*  just going to focus on merit and get incredible people. And it'll turn out that you'll get your, [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7322.72s)]
*  you know, diversity wish, but you're not going to get it by mandating it and forcing it down [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7329.280000000001s)]
*  our throats. We're just going to get the best people. And then the best people are just going [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7333.4400000000005s)]
*  to go and kick ass together. You know, we're going to get an ecology that we protect and love because [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7337.76s)]
*  we want to be out there hunting, fishing, camping, living it, skiing it, whatever it is. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7345.4400000000005s)]
*  But we're going to get there because we actually manage it and take care of it and clean up all of [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7351.12s)]
*  the stuff that would otherwise burn it to the ground. So we're going to test [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7357.44s)]
*  all of this stuff. And I think it's going to work. And then the other thing we need to do is we need [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7366.48s)]
*  to cut down all of these things that are these little ropes that are pulling us all back, meaning [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7373.36s)]
*  that this is a stretch, but I'll use myself in this example. I think I'm one of those 50,000 [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7380.639999999999s)]
*  people that can go and ram and jam for Team USA. I can't, I've been, you know, there are moments [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7386.08s)]
*  where I've been really dunking on people, you know, if this was a basketball analogy, I want to do [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7391.68s)]
*  more of that. I want Team USA to kick ass. I just want it to be a little bit easier. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7396.16s)]
*  And so I hope that we figure out a way instead of having 60,000 little regulations and people that [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRlkcRnC9eE&t=7403.599999999999s)]
