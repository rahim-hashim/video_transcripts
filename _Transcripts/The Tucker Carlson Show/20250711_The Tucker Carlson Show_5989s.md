# George Santos Airs All of Congress’ Dirty Laundry in Final Interview Before Prison
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI)
*  Every interview you do, the reporter ends up lecturing you, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=0.0s)]
*  giving you a moral lecture, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3.74s)]
*  and I just lived in DC for too long, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4.96s)]
*  and I have you in perspective [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=6.46s)]
*  with everyone else you serve with. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=8.76s)]
*  The other 435, you are not the sleaziest person I've ever seen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=10.18s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=13.98s)]
*  You may have the longest prison term, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=15.98s)]
*  but you are not the most deserving. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=17.26s)]
*  You are, in my opinion, the funniest member of Congress [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=19.22s)]
*  I've ever seen, and to me that counts for something. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=22.66s)]
*  So I'm not exactly sure how you got seven, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=25.34s)]
*  I mean, you're going to prison, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=27.98s)]
*  and how long from now? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=28.94s)]
*  24 days from today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=29.66s)]
*  How in the world did you get seven years in prison? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=31.66s)]
*  I asked myself that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=56.78s)]
*  I bet you do. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=59.02s)]
*  I'm looking at this, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=61.18s)]
*  and I'm treating this as like a mental exercise, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=62.18s)]
*  it's gymnastics. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=64.66s)]
*  Tucker, just put it this way, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=66.86s)]
*  no one is going to prison for what I'm going to prison for, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=69.86s)]
*  because if they were, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=73.46000000000001s)]
*  we wouldn't have half a Congress right now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=75.58s)]
*  And that's on both sides. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=77.7s)]
*  I mean, AOC still has a million dollars AWOL [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=79.78s)]
*  from her 2022 campaign that still hasn't been resolved. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=82.54s)]
*  Nobody knows where it went. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=84.94s)]
*  Unaccounted receipts or whatever the case excuses. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=86.53999999999999s)]
*  McCormick down in Florida, the Democrat, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=90.42s)]
*  she accidentally took $5 million from COVID relief. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=93.1s)]
*  It was an accident, it was meant to be 5,000, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=97.5s)]
*  but somebody added extra zeros. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=100.02s)]
*  She's not going to prison. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=102.17999999999999s)]
*  Even David Schweiker, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=105.06s)]
*  who had a four year long ethics investigation against him [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=106.42s)]
*  for misusing campaign funds, got a $200,000 fine. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=110.2s)]
*  No one got indicted in 87 days. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=114.3s)]
*  I'm the fastest member of Congress to get indicted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=117.22s)]
*  in the history of Congress. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=118.94000000000001s)]
*  Well, and one of the charges against you, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=120.5s)]
*  I just read is identity theft. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  Yes, identity theft. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=123.82000000000001s)]
*  So we have what the estimate is 50 million people [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=124.66000000000001s)]
*  living here illegally, most of them working, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=127.30000000000001s)]
*  every non-citizen without a visa [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=129.82s)]
*  with a job in the United States [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=132.42000000000002s)]
*  is committing identity theft. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=133.62s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=134.78s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's a fake social security numbers, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=135.74s)]
*  fake driver's license. That's it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=137.34s)]
*  Yeah, they all have fake documents. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=138.46s)]
*  I don't think anyone's ever been indicted [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=140.46s)]
*  of those tens of millions of people committing identity theft, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  that you were indicted and convicted of identity theft. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=144.26s)]
*  Well, it's not even just that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=146.22s)]
*  There's the Dubin decision in the Supreme Court [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=147.82s)]
*  that came down last year, actually, late last year, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=150.17999999999998s)]
*  or mid last year, pardon me, too soon. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=153.1s)]
*  Wrong person, actually. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=157.7s)]
*  So it essentially says that if identity theft [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=159.94s)]
*  isn't the crux of the crime, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=164.54s)]
*  and if it's a consequence, right? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  And I'm not making excuses here. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=169.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm just saying, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=170.5s)]
*  you cannot be charged for aggravated identity theft. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=171.34s)]
*  And this is a case. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=174.18s)]
*  The case they make against me [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  is that I stole people's credit cards [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=177.18s)]
*  and I went on shopping sprees. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=178.9s)]
*  That is categorically false. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=180.3s)]
*  The evidence doesn't even corroborate [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=181.66s)]
*  or substantiate that, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=183.18s)]
*  But they went on with the media narrative [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=185.5s)]
*  because it was easier. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=187.9s)]
*  For the prosecution, they knew eventually [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=188.86s)]
*  they would squeeze me out of the ability [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=191.3s)]
*  to defend myself, right? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  And pay for defense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=193.86s)]
*  I went through every last penny I had [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=195.34s)]
*  and bank accounts closing on me, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=197.38s)]
*  bank relationships, Wells Fargo. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=199.3s)]
*  I had an account with them for over 15 years. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  I had a great line of credit with them. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=202.9s)]
*  Boom, closed on me after being harassed [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=204.34s)]
*  with subpoenas by the FBI. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=207.46s)]
*  Same thing for Citibank, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  which I kept my business accounts at Citibank. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=210.34s)]
*  Boom. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=213.06s)]
*  And I mean, I was, in 2022 at least, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=213.9s)]
*  I did transactions, legitimate business transactions [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=218.26s)]
*  that were not contested to the tune [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=221.1s)]
*  of almost a million dollars at Citibank. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=222.58s)]
*  They closed on me. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=224.06s)]
*  Like banks that I had great relationships with [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=225.34s)]
*  wouldn't extend me line of credit, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=227.58s)]
*  American Express closed. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=229.86s)]
*  I'm banned for life from American Express. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=230.98s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=233.42s)]
*  Because the crux of the crimes charged, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  levied against me are fraud, are financial fraud. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=238.1s)]
*  It's white collar. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=240.33999999999997s)]
*  Why would they wanna do business [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=241.17999999999998s)]
*  with a high-risk client like myself? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  That's their excuse, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=244.54s)]
*  So as the circle starts narrowing on me, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=246.42s)]
*  I ran out of options [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  and that's how I ended up in a bad plea. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=250.62s)]
*  Identity theft. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=253.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you committed identity theft [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  in the same sense that Sacha Baron Cohen [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=255.54s)]
*  commits identity theft, like in the service of hilarity. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=257.46s)]
*  I'll give you better. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=259.94s)]
*  I committed identity theft in the same sense [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=261.38s)]
*  that ActBlue committed identity theft. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=263.73999999999995s)]
*  Having clients on reoccurring donations, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=265.9s)]
*  it's not my donors, pardon me. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=268.46s)]
*  Having donors on reoccurring donations [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  does not constitute identity theft per se, right? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=273.58s)]
*  So can you explain what that means? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=278.38s)]
*  So in other words, if I give my credit card [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=279.21999999999997s)]
*  to a charity or a bundler like ActBlue, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=280.94s)]
*  they keep charging it like monthly or something. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=284.06s)]
*  There's a checkbox, right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=285.62s)]
*  You're supposed to select that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=287.38s)]
*  when you're doing the donation. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=288.66s)]
*  If you don't deselect that, and this is a big issue, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=290.22s)]
*  I agree, in hindsight, political bundlers [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=292.62s)]
*  like WinRed and ActBlue [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=296.1s)]
*  should not even have that option on there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=297.46s)]
*  I think that's entrapment. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=299.58s)]
*  I genuinely believe that, you know, looking in retrospect. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=300.7s)]
*  It's an onus so large on the donor and on the candidate, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=304.66s)]
*  it becomes a nightmare. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=308.58s)]
*  Because if you go there and you donate the max donation to me [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=309.98s)]
*  and forget to uncheck that box, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=312.42s)]
*  now you're on a reoccurring max, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=314.02s)]
*  you're going to completely be maxed out per the FEC. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=315.74s)]
*  Now, if I had a good operation and a good treasurer, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=319.18s)]
*  what would that treasurer do? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=323.62s)]
*  Start returning donations, going there, manually removing. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=324.74s)]
*  She wasn't doing any of that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=327.65999999999997s)]
*  She was moving money around. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=328.82s)]
*  It got so convoluted. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=331.06s)]
*  And I trusted her, and you know, it is what it is. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=332.7s)]
*  Here I am. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=336.18s)]
*  Seven years, if you look at the crux of the crime, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  it is $55,000 of misuse of campaign funds. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=342.34s)]
*  I admit to that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=345.42s)]
*  I admit that, you know, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=346.54s)]
*  I thought they were all within the purview of spending. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=348.02s)]
*  I was told it was all, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=351.02s)]
*  and I had no reservations of making those. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=352.18s)]
*  I didn't do them in secrecy. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=353.94s)]
*  They were blatantly done [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=355.58s)]
*  because they were reported to the FEC. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=357.26s)]
*  So I bought a new suit here or there, or I got Botox. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=359.06s)]
*  Apparently they said it was okay for 800 bucks, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  although despite the fact that I've spent thousands of dollars [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=364.5s)]
*  on Botox of my own money, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=366.86s)]
*  but I spent 800 of the campaign funds on Botox. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=368.42s)]
*  Then comes all these other, like- [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=372.14s)]
*  Are you worried that Botox affects your brain after a while? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=374.46s)]
*  Probably. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=377.5s)]
*  I don't know much about Botox. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=378.34s)]
*  It's like the- [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=381.73999999999995s)]
*  It's a neurotoxin, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=382.73999999999995s)]
*  Sorry, I've always wanted to ask a user that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=385.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, sure, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=387.26s)]
*  there's a side effect to everything, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=388.9s)]
*  We drink booze, it's bad for your liver. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  No, no, for sure. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=392.14s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=393.02s)]
*  So I look at it the same way, but I guess I can, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=393.85999999999996s)]
*  no matter what I die, I'm always gonna have great skin. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=398.38s)]
*  And you're all gonna see that, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=400.94s)]
*  but you're never gonna know that my liver's falling apart. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=403.42s)]
*  But that's kind of like the entire existence [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=407.54s)]
*  of this identity theft. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=412.42s)]
*  And there's an entire Supreme Court decision [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=413.54s)]
*  that the judge in my case completely ignored. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=415.34000000000003s)]
*  We made that motion, by the way. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=417.34000000000003s)]
*  This is a judge, Joanna Cyberg, who was appointed by Clinton, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=418.98s)]
*  but has a stellar reputation of being fair, very fair, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=423.02000000000004s)]
*  until she tries George Santos. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=428.34000000000003s)]
*  And then she completely broke from precedent. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=430.42s)]
*  Every attorney in New York was telling my legal team, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=432.58000000000004s)]
*  like, you guys drew the judge lottery. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=435.74s)]
*  So much so that at one point, the DOJ was trying [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=437.82s)]
*  to judge shop. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=440.1s)]
*  They kept creating relatable indictments [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=441.14000000000004s)]
*  within the same case, but presenting them in Brooklyn. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=444.66s)]
*  Trying to get, and then would say, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=447.82000000000005s)]
*  in the interest of justice and of preserving public funds, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=450.06s)]
*  these cases are related, we want to adjoin them. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=453.38s)]
*  Lucky, or I guess not lucky for me, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=456.3s)]
*  she was very tenacious and says, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  no, they're all coming to me. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=460.98s)]
*  She's the senior judge on the bench [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=462.7s)]
*  in the Eastern District of New York. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=464.3s)]
*  So you would think, she's seasoned. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=465.94s)]
*  She's gone through all the nonsense, right? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=468.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=471.58s)]
*  But no, at the end of the day, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=472.5s)]
*  she just slammed the book at me, 87 months. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=473.9s)]
*  Didn't even, she read the indictment inside the courtroom. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=476.5s)]
*  She went in there with her decision completely pre-written. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=479.7s)]
*  She did not, it didn't matter what we can argue [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=485.18s)]
*  during sentencing, she didn't care. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=488.14s)]
*  It was pre-written, she read it, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=490.06s)]
*  she read my attorney, she read us, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=492.02s)]
*  she sided with every single aspect of the prosecution. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=494.34s)]
*  But what strikes me incredible is Nancy Marks, my treasurer, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=500.26s)]
*  just got sentenced to six, to three years, pardon me, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=505.62s)]
*  probation, she's not going to be a day in prison. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=508.66s)]
*  This is a person who has had run-ins [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=511.22s)]
*  with the FBI in the past, so I've learned afterwards. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=513.1s)]
*  This is a person who, in 2022, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=516.3s)]
*  to the own admission and contradiction, by the way, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=518.78s)]
*  of the DOJ, did worse acts of criminality [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=521.26s)]
*  and manipulation on another candidate's, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=527.5s)]
*  another Republican candidate's, FEC reports, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=530.14s)]
*  a big candidate, by the way, somebody, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=533.5s)]
*  person didn't win, but millions of dollars worth [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=535.54s)]
*  of a campaign and she was a treasurer, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=538.02s)]
*  and then to top it off, they never indicted that person [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=540.3s)]
*  or gave her those charges. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=543.86s)]
*  They were just after me. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=546.3s)]
*  Even though we're talking small potatoes with George Anters. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=547.66s)]
*  They were definitely after you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=550.2199999999999s)]
*  If you use Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=551.66s)]
*  then you're overpaying for your phone. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=553.9399999999999s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=555.3s)]
*  The companies don't want you to hear that, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=556.14s)]
*  but it's absolutely true. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=557.3s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=558.3399999999999s)]
*  Well, think about it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=559.18s)]
*  Your monthly payment funds thousands of retail stores, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=560.0s)]
*  their retail stores, you're never gonna go to. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=563.54s)]
*  You're also probably paying for unnecessary perks [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=566.14s)]
*  you'll never use. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=567.9s)]
*  There's a better way. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=569.1s)]
*  Buy what you need. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=570.2199999999999s)]
*  It's called PureTalk. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=572.74s)]
*  PureTalk uses the same 5G networks [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=574.02s)]
*  as those other companies, literally the same cell tower, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=576.66s)]
*  so it's not off grid or done with a wire between cans. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=578.9s)]
*  It's the highest tech available, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=583.18s)]
*  but PureTalk doesn't charge for the add-ons [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  that send most bills to the roof. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=587.5799999999999s)]
*  Instead, PureTalk gives you unlimited talk, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=588.98s)]
*  tax plenty of data for 25 bucks a month. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=591.26s)]
*  25 bucks a month, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=595.6999999999999s)]
*  that's probably less than half what you're paying. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=596.54s)]
*  You get the same service, exact same service. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=598.26s)]
*  Go to puretalk.com slash Tucker. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=600.98s)]
*  You save an additional 50% off your first month. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=602.72s)]
*  The switch can take less than 10 minutes. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=605.4s)]
*  They do not hassle you, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=606.88s)]
*  and you don't have to switch your phone [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=608.32s)]
*  or your phone number. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=609.76s)]
*  You don't give up anything. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=610.6s)]
*  You only save money. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=611.6s)]
*  PureTalk.com slash Tucker. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=613.24s)]
*  PureTalk, wireless by Americans for Americans. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=614.92s)]
*  So that's what I noticed, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=618.96s)]
*  just having seen this for so long. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=621.48s)]
*  You see this pattern where a guy is marked for destruction, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=623.28s)]
*  and it's kind of assured at that point. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=628.04s)]
*  First his enemies attack, then his allies abandon him, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=630.8000000000001s)]
*  then the media backs up everyone who's against him, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=634.32s)]
*  and then the justice system moves against him, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=637.72s)]
*  and there's just no mercy at all. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=640.1s)]
*  And I've seen it with all kinds of people, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=642.5200000000001s)]
*  some who deserved it, others who didn't. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=644.12s)]
*  But I saw it happening to you, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=646.6s)]
*  and I didn't really understand the details. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=647.7600000000001s)]
*  And the whole time I was thinking, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=649.12s)]
*  I know what's gonna happen, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=650.32s)]
*  that man is going to jail, okay? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=651.1600000000001s)]
*  Because like everyone's against him. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=652.98s)]
*  No one will defend him. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=655.6s)]
*  But I couldn't understand why it was happening. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=657.88s)]
*  I'm ideological, so I was trying to think. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=659.6400000000001s)]
*  I looked into your positions on everything, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=661.1600000000001s)]
*  you know, you're conservative for New York, [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=664.04s)]
*  but your positions are not radical at all. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  They're totally within what we call the mainstream [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=669.16s)]
*  of the Republican Party. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=671.48s)]
*  So I don't think, this is just my theory. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=672.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you think you said anything on the issues [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=674.8399999999999s)]
*  that deeply offended people? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=677.66s)]
*  Not on the conservative issues. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=679.0799999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=680.48s)]
*  I totally offended Libs. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=681.3199999999999s)]
*  You definitely offended the Libs. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=683.0s)]
*  I do that for sport. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=683.9599999999999s)]
*  Here's my biggest crime. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=685.04s)]
*  I'm a gay man who's a Republican, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=686.7199999999999s)]
*  and I won a seat in the middle of New York City. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=688.4399999999999s)]
*  That's not, that can't stand. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=691.16s)]
*  No, no, no, they hate you for that, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=692.48s)]
*  but then the Republicans abandoned you too. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=693.9200000000001s)]
*  Look, I'll say this. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=696.36s)]
*  It was a small group of Republicans [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=698.32s)]
*  who abandoned me at first, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=700.04s)]
*  and those were the people who wanted to settle putty scores. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=701.08s)]
*  Nick La Lota, Anthony Diasposito, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=704.24s)]
*  these are all local guys, right? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=706.12s)]
*  So the former congressman Diasposito, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=707.38s)]
*  because he said that expelling me [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=709.64s)]
*  would secure his reelection. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=711.36s)]
*  Well, that didn't work out that way. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=712.9200000000001s)]
*  Neither for him, Brandon Williams, or Mark Molinaro. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=714.5600000000001s)]
*  All three of them lost their elections, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=716.96s)]
*  in which they weren't supposed to, but they did. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=718.48s)]
*  Nick La Lota, who replaced Lee Zeldin, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=720.96s)]
*  which is an absolute travesty, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=722.76s)]
*  because Lee was an actual conservative, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=724.52s)]
*  this dude's just, I can't even detail to you, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=726.76s)]
*  like where on the barometer [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=730.0400000000001s)]
*  would he even measure as a conservative? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=732.3000000000001s)]
*  Because the dude caves and votes for every CR [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=734.0s)]
*  that's ever been presented, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=736.4000000000001s)]
*  and is contributing to the destruction of our economy, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=737.76s)]
*  contributing to the destruction of our country in general, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  by putting us in perpetual debt. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=744.0400000000001s)]
*  These guys didn't like me back home, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=745.9200000000001s)]
*  because I was, quote, the rising star in New York. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=748.02s)]
*  Nobody likes that. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=751.62s)]
*  It's all about self-aggrandizement for these guys. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=752.86s)]
*  And when there's one sucking more energy than the other, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=755.08s)]
*  they're not gonna like him. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=757.5s)]
*  And that's how it boiled down. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=758.7s)]
*  So when I was vulnerable for the first time [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=760.28s)]
*  in four years that they've interacted with me, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=762.78s)]
*  belly up, and they're like, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=765.5s)]
*  ah, this is an opportunity we're not gonna miss. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=766.58s)]
*  And they just went in for the jugular. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=769.0600000000001s)]
*  But what about in the congress? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=770.94s)]
*  In congress, these two guys [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=773.26s)]
*  managed to move people's minds. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=775.8199999999999s)]
*  One's a former cop, the other one's a former serviceman. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=779.18s)]
*  So they built those relationships with that kind of caucus [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=782.6999999999999s)]
*  in the former cop's a former serviceman. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=785.9399999999999s)]
*  So they kind of have that brotherly bond. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=788.62s)]
*  So those guys all disbanded towards them and against me. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=790.5s)]
*  Look, if it wasn't for people like Tim Burchett [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=794.5s)]
*  to extend a friendly hand and pull me in, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=797.98s)]
*  I probably would have sat in a corner by myself. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=800.66s)]
*  Like from Tennessee. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=802.6999999999999s)]
*  From Tennessee, yes. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=803.54s)]
*  Such a good man. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=804.38s)]
*  He was my mentor and I've learned one thing from him. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=806.38s)]
*  We don't need to agree to be friends. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=808.34s)]
*  That's totally right. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=810.5s)]
*  I mean, he's like, you know, he's more as. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=811.34s)]
*  He gets along with Maxine Waters. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=813.22s)]
*  Totally, and he has my politics, I think. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=815.3000000000001s)]
*  But he's just a really decent, like Massey, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=817.74s)]
*  he's just a decent person. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=819.98s)]
*  I love Massey, disagree with him on stuff. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=821.0600000000001s)]
*  Of course, I get it. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=822.86s)]
*  But I'm just saying like as a person. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=823.7800000000001s)]
*  But I love the guy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=824.62s)]
*  So who were your friends in the congress? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=826.98s)]
*  Tim Burchett. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=828.82s)]
*  I love Trent Kelly in Mississippi. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=830.7800000000001s)]
*  I mean, who would think a gay man from New York [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=832.6600000000001s)]
*  could get along with a guy from Mississippi? [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=834.9399999999999s)]
*  But I love Trent Kelly, Lauren Boeber. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=836.42s)]
*  Marjorie was always very, very good to me. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=838.54s)]
*  Matt Gaetz, you know, I've known Gaetz longer [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=841.3399999999999s)]
*  than I know all of them. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=843.66s)]
*  I mean, I've just known Gaetz for years at this point. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=844.74s)]
*  I think since I kind of entered the political scene, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=847.66s)]
*  he's a very welcoming. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=849.9399999999999s)]
*  He's a great recruiter, I would say, for the party. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=851.62s)]
*  Because he's young and he's not, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=854.06s)]
*  he doesn't have all these preconceived notions [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=856.02s)]
*  about people or how people need to be. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=858.62s)]
*  So it's very easy to get along with him. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=860.66s)]
*  Also no barriers with Gaetz. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=862.5s)]
*  He was taxed like you can call him. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=863.5s)]
*  And I fight with Gaetz plenty. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=865.0600000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=866.1800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I get it. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=867.02s)]
*  I argue with him plenty, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=868.86s)]
*  but I would always go to his office [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  when I needed some guidance on stuff [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=871.34s)]
*  he was always willing to. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=872.6600000000001s)]
*  Thomas Massey guided me through some tough votes [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=873.58s)]
*  that I didn't understand. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=876.02s)]
*  Freshman congressman, I don't understand everything. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=877.3000000000001s)]
*  No matter how much of a bookworm you might be, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=879.38s)]
*  when you get there, you're voting on things [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  that you really don't understand [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=882.46s)]
*  and you need seek guidance. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=883.9s)]
*  Sought that guidance from Massey so many times [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=885.26s)]
*  and so many times he was willingly available. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=887.5400000000001s)]
*  I would turn around and say, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=892.26s)]
*  Massey, I understand what you're saying, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=893.0600000000001s)]
*  but I kind of disagree with you. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=894.62s)]
*  I would take the information [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=896.82s)]
*  and still vote contrary to him sometimes. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=897.98s)]
*  You can't hurt his feelings though. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=899.6600000000001s)]
*  You can't though. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=900.7s)]
*  I mean, look, the one thing Massey and I [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=901.5400000000001s)]
*  always will agree on, I'll never vote for a CR. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=903.02s)]
*  I never voted for a CR, never will vote for a CR. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=905.02s)]
*  It's just- [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=907.62s)]
*  Why? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=908.46s)]
*  You cannot perpetually live borrowing money. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=910.5s)]
*  You will bankrupt this nation into oblivion. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=913.86s)]
*  And if you do not balance the budget, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=916.9s)]
*  it's the biggest existential threat we have today [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=918.94s)]
*  is not Iran. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=921.94s)]
*  Despite we don't agree on Iran, I hate Iran. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=922.9000000000001s)]
*  Iran's not great. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=926.62s)]
*  I'm not saying Iran's great. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=927.46s)]
*  Iran's terrible, but you're not our biggest problem. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=928.3000000000001s)]
*  Today, our biggest problem is domestic. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=931.0200000000001s)]
*  It's debt, right? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=932.62s)]
*  And the fact that we, one big, beautiful bill. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=933.7s)]
*  Love the bill, I love the intentions, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=935.86s)]
*  but I think the framework of the intentions are flawed [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=938.0200000000001s)]
*  because they started off by cutting back spending [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=940.2600000000001s)]
*  based on 2024 levels. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=943.58s)]
*  They're supposed to cut back spending based on 2019 levels [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=945.58s)]
*  because anything from 2019 forward has Pelosi's COVID pork [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=948.58s)]
*  and we're still spending at COVID level today. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=953.22s)]
*  Don't take it from me, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=956.7s)]
*  call any other member of Congress. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=957.5400000000001s)]
*  We still spend at COVID-19 levels today. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=959.14s)]
*  We might've rolled back some provisions, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=962.5s)]
*  but the spending is the same levels of 2020 onward. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=964.14s)]
*  If you really wanna be serious about cutting back spending, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=968.94s)]
*  you go back to 2019 and you cut on top of that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=971.5400000000001s)]
*  because we were already about 40% over budget. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=974.1400000000001s)]
*  That's my standing financially, fiscally. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=977.38s)]
*  I think that seems totally reasonable. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=979.26s)]
*  And it's the only reasonable way forward, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=981.14s)]
*  but you can't even get the framework [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=983.26s)]
*  of the one big, beautiful bill to be perfect. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=985.34s)]
*  Again, I'm not gonna let perfect be the enemy of good. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=987.54s)]
*  There's good things in the bill, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=990.06s)]
*  but this version coming back from the Senate, not for me. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=991.1s)]
*  I don't know about others. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=996.1s)]
*  It's definitely not for me. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=997.34s)]
*  So, but you don't have to deal with it [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=999.22s)]
*  because you were literally expelled. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1000.58s)]
*  Pretty much, yep. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1002.42s)]
*  So, okay, this is a philosophical question, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1003.34s)]
*  but I'm sure you've pondered it. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1005.5s)]
*  You were elected by the voters of your district in New York [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1007.26s)]
*  in Nassau County. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1011.14s)]
*  Yep, Nassau and Queens. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1012.18s)]
*  And Queens. Don't forget about Queens. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1013.54s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1014.78s)]
*  I'm a Queens boy. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1015.62s)]
*  Right, and one of the boroughs. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1016.46s)]
*  So, but that's where your authority comes from. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1018.38s)]
*  And in a representative democracy, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1022.1s)]
*  you're representing the democracy. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1023.54s)]
*  Like you're an instrument of our system. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1025.62s)]
*  So, how can you be fired by other elected representatives? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1027.66s)]
*  Like, how can, I don't understand how that works. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1032.78s)]
*  Well, Thomas Massey said it best. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1036.26s)]
*  I will not overturn the election results [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1038.22s)]
*  of the third district of New York. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1040.26s)]
*  Okay, so that's what I'm saying. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1041.1000000000001s)]
*  Right, and that is just a crisper way to say [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1041.94s)]
*  what I was trying to express. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1043.66s)]
*  That's what he said, right? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1044.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1045.3400000000001s)]
*  And he says, this is preposterous. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1046.18s)]
*  Let you go and be fired by the people who sent you here. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1047.5400000000002s)]
*  At the time, no convictions. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1050.5400000000002s)]
*  I still had, a trial was a long's way. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1053.1000000000001s)]
*  So, no due process offered. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1055.8600000000001s)]
*  They call a political hit piece in Ethics Report, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1057.66s)]
*  and I'll give you a little tidbit of the Ethics Report. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1061.54s)]
*  And I have to do the air quotes [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1064.38s)]
*  because it irritates me to know [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1065.7s)]
*  that this will forever be in my record. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1067.94s)]
*  I had a hit type plant person try to work in my office [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1069.94s)]
*  called Derek Meyer from Ohio. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1075.62s)]
*  Completely insane Looney Tune guy. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1077.26s)]
*  He wanted to work in my office. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1079.98s)]
*  One of my staffer said, he's a good guy, whatever. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1081.5s)]
*  We did vetting on him. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1083.22s)]
*  Turns out he was nuts. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1084.18s)]
*  He was under investigation [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1085.14s)]
*  for wiretapping a federal courtroom. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1086.82s)]
*  So we said, we don't need the drama right now. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1088.86s)]
*  I have enough drama. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1091.78s)]
*  I don't need a sideshow. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1094.3799999999999s)]
*  So we said, no. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1096.06s)]
*  This man, after being told no, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1097.1399999999999s)]
*  went to the ethics committee, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1101.4599999999998s)]
*  complained that we made him work for free. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1103.74s)]
*  Oh, but made a bunch of stuff. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1107.9799999999998s)]
*  None of it stuck. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1109.4199999999998s)]
*  Accused you of slavery. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1110.4599999999998s)]
*  Pretty much, right? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1111.82s)]
*  None of it stuck. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1113.26s)]
*  Then after a whole week goes by, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1114.3799999999999s)]
*  he decided to pull out what card [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1116.3799999999999s)]
*  can you possibly think he pulled out of the pocket? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1118.1399999999999s)]
*  A sexual assault. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1120.82s)]
*  So upset, I was gonna go with racism, but okay. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1122.22s)]
*  Sexual assault, right? [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1124.1799999999998s)]
*  And I said, wow, that's a first even for me. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1125.4599999999998s)]
*  I was shocked. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1127.82s)]
*  I was flabbergasted. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1128.82s)]
*  Like, wow, I've never been accused of being pervy. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1129.9399999999998s)]
*  So I sit at home, I go back to my partner. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1132.74s)]
*  I'm like, I'm being accused of being pervy. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1137.06s)]
*  He's like, they definitely don't know you. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1138.82s)]
*  I'm such a square. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1142.82s)]
*  And we were just like shocked. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1144.22s)]
*  This plays out. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1146.54s)]
*  He made bombastic allegations about sexual assault. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1147.7s)]
*  That I groped his groin, I invited him to karaoke. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1151.02s)]
*  None of which was true. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1153.46s)]
*  Then when he gave his testimony, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1155.06s)]
*  he gave detailed dates and times. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1156.9s)]
*  Lucky congresspeople who have good staff like I did, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1159.1000000000001s)]
*  have a very detailed calendar of my whereabouts. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1163.22s)]
*  With plenty of pictures. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1166.9s)]
*  They're following with pictures and video [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1168.66s)]
*  to post on social media. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1170.1000000000001s)]
*  Look, he's working. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1171.18s)]
*  The whole dog and pony show. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1172.5s)]
*  He's not at karaoke. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1173.7s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1174.7s)]
*  So it became so hysterical. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1175.66s)]
*  The ethics committee called him, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1181.02s)]
*  for the lack of all the words, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1184.82s)]
*  didn't say straight out liar, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1186.14s)]
*  but he lacked credibility and evidence to prove. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1187.3s)]
*  And that the evidence to counter it was so overwhelming, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1190.38s)]
*  they dismissed it. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1193.54s)]
*  This was an office of congressional ethics. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1194.6200000000001s)]
*  So the chairman of the ethics committee, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1196.9s)]
*  Michael Guess, in his infinite wisdom [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1199.38s)]
*  and his expulsion resolution, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1201.18s)]
*  contradicted his own ethics report. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1202.94s)]
*  Which exonerates me from sexual assault, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1205.5400000000002s)]
*  but he puts it in the expulsion resolution. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1208.18s)]
*  That whereas I engage in sexual harassment [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1210.46s)]
*  and sexual misconduct in my office, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1214.1000000000001s)]
*  in my capacity as a member of Congress. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1216.6200000000001s)]
*  To enhance the, because he accused me of, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1218.5800000000002s)]
*  the ethics report also accused me of having [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1222.5400000000002s)]
*  a number of high interest credit cards [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1225.38s)]
*  to rely to keep my lifestyle up. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1228.7800000000002s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1231.78s)]
*  That was Joe Biden's economy. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1232.6200000000001s)]
*  Interest rates were up all across the board. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1233.46s)]
*  I'm sorry for being American and over leveraging myself. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1235.42s)]
*  So I have bad spending habits. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1238.8600000000001s)]
*  Like they use this as evidence against me, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1240.9s)]
*  and built this entire report. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1245.5800000000002s)]
*  Like a trailer park economic going on [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1247.5800000000002s)]
*  and they were mad about it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1249.5800000000002s)]
*  They were pretty mad. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1250.54s)]
*  Like I'm like, I'm sorry, but I do it well. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1251.6200000000001s)]
*  That was kind of the issue. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1256.9s)]
*  So when you look at this and you have Troy Nels [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1258.54s)]
*  and all these very serious former law enforcement officers [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1262.26s)]
*  who look at this and says, this reads straight up [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1266.18s)]
*  like a political hit piece. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1270.02s)]
*  No good cop would ever turn this over to a DA and say, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1271.7s)]
*  here, here's the charging documents. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1276.3s)]
*  But this is what the ethics committee did. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1278.58s)]
*  And it was enough, I guess, to convince 105 Republicans [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1280.6599999999999s)]
*  to join the Democrats in expelling a Republican. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1284.54s)]
*  So we wanna brag, but this has got to be [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1287.86s)]
*  the most pro dog podcast on the entire internet. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1289.8999999999999s)]
*  They're almost always dogs actually just off camera. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1294.22s)]
*  So dogs are non-negotiable. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1297.7s)]
*  Dogs are the best. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1299.34s)]
*  And people who love dogs really, really love them. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1300.46s)]
*  We can relate. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1302.58s)]
*  And so for that reason, we are thrilled to announce [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1303.4199999999998s)]
*  a new partner called Dutch Pet. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1305.6599999999999s)]

*  and they do it at a high speed. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1321.18s)]
*  And by the way, if you ever brought your dog to the vet, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1322.46s)]
*  the dog doesn't like it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1324.94s)]
*  They can smell the darkness. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1326.8600000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it's true. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1328.54s)]
*  Sometimes you have to go to the vet, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1329.46s)]

*  This is gonna change the game [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1384.02s)]
*  and we're proud to be partnered with them. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1386.06s)]
*  You think of all the Republicans who hate their party, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1387.78s)]
*  worked against their party. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1391.62s)]
*  You think of all the Republicans. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1392.66s)]
*  Those are the 105. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1394.3s)]
*  Oh, they're fair. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1395.62s)]
*  But you think it's like the crazy behavior [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1398.46s)]
*  that goes on in Congress. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1400.82s)]
*  And I do wanna ask you about that at some point, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1401.7s)]
*  but like that is a wild precedent to set. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1403.0600000000002s)]
*  We're just gonna expel someone from a body [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1408.3400000000001s)]
*  to which he was elected? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1410.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, they are pretty self-important up there. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1411.7s)]
*  But you would think that they would also be interested [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1416.46s)]
*  in self-preservation to the point where they would say, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1418.74s)]
*  let's not set that precedent. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1420.6200000000001s)]
*  Let's not start doing that. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1421.78s)]
*  Well, here's the funny thing. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1423.3400000000001s)]
*  I was expelled, no due process, right? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1424.7s)]
*  And you had not been convicted? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1427.7s)]
*  No, no adjudication whatsoever, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1428.8999999999999s)]
*  just allegations at the point. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1431.6999999999998s)]
*  And had I not been expelled, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1433.54s)]
*  I'd still probably have a Jews to put up a fight. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1434.8999999999999s)]
*  But when you're expelled, you lose juice. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1437.58s)]
*  I don't know how to put it to you. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1440.3s)]
*  That's well put. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1442.5s)]
*  I lost juice. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1443.54s)]
*  I had no gas in my tank to keep going forward. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1444.54s)]
*  So yeah, I totally. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1447.34s)]
*  Okay, so the leadership of the Republican conference, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1449.34s)]
*  the Republicans in the House would be able, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1453.62s)]
*  I think to tell Republicans how to vote on this. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1456.2199999999998s)]
*  So. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1457.98s)]
*  So Mike Johnson's the speaker. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1460.1000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna say this. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1461.42s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy was 10 times a better leader [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1462.78s)]
*  for the conference than Mike Johnson is. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1466.54s)]
*  Well, that's for sure. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1468.02s)]
*  I mean, no question. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1469.38s)]
*  Oh, I've noticed, yes. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1470.7s)]
*  I can't believe I'm saying that. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1471.8600000000001s)]
*  You don't need to agree with Kevin's politics per se. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1473.3s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1476.74s)]
*  But he was a great leader. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1477.6200000000001s)]
*  He knew how to, he whipped that into shape. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1479.38s)]
*  He was kind of agnostic on the ideas part. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1481.18s)]
*  He just wanted to win, right? [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1483.18s)]
*  He just wanted to win. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1484.3s)]
*  He's a winner, he wants to win. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1485.14s)]
*  And that's fine for me. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1486.58s)]
*  I kind of disagreed with him a lot. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1487.98s)]
*  Like I've let him down a few times, but you know what? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1489.46s)]
*  He had my back. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1491.74s)]
*  So I always go back and I tell Matt Gaetz, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1492.62s)]
*  do you still really think it was a good idea [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1494.62s)]
*  vacating McCarthy? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1496.22s)]
*  Cost me my seat, cost the conference a seat, you know? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1497.54s)]
*  But I think. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1500.7s)]
*  I was so mean to Kevin, who I should just say is a nice man. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1501.54s)]
*  And I saw him at dinner last summer. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1505.78s)]
*  He was seated at the table next to me. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1507.22s)]
*  He couldn't even look at me. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1508.34s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I was so mean to that guy. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1509.18s)]
*  He's easy to be mean to. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1511.54s)]
*  It's easy because he was the face [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1513.06s)]
*  of something you were angry at. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1514.3799999999999s)]
*  It's true, I'm annoyed by Republican leadership always. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1515.7s)]
*  But then you look at Mike Johnson, who's. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1517.94s)]
*  A disappointment. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1520.54s)]
*  So much potential. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1522.9s)]
*  Authorizing all this killing in the name of Jesus. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1523.74s)]
*  It's like, I can barely stand it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1525.74s)]
*  So yes, I think those of us who thought [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1527.78s)]
*  kicking Kevin McCarthy out of leader, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1530.7s)]
*  I had nothing to do with it, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1532.26s)]
*  but just cheerleading from the sidelines, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1533.1000000000001s)]
*  we were completely wrong. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1534.8600000000001s)]
*  And I think it's important to admit that. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1535.78s)]
*  I agree. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1536.98s)]
*  And so Mike Johnson takes a posture of your conscience. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1537.82s)]
*  At least Stefanik is freaking out. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1543.42s)]
*  Like, what do you mean vote your conscience? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1544.82s)]
*  Like. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1546.74s)]
*  This is the Congress. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1547.58s)]
*  You don't have a conscience? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1548.42s)]
*  She firmly votes to keep me, Mike Johnson, Skalise. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1549.74s)]
*  Most of leadership who matters. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1555.78s)]
*  And then you have the useful idiots like Richard Hudson, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1557.7s)]
*  which I don't expect you to know who he is, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1560.46s)]
*  but believe it or not, he's the chairman of the NRCC, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1561.94s)]
*  which is in charge of recruitment. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1564.74s)]
*  Now you wonder why we can't expand the majority. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1566.46s)]
*  Who is he? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1568.62s)]
*  A former staffer became congressman, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1569.7s)]
*  which is a worst way to become a congressman. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1572.18s)]
*  From a state? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1573.62s)]
*  From the state of North Carolina. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1574.46s)]
*  So he was a staffer to a congressman, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1576.06s)]
*  then became the congressman. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1577.66s)]
*  And now somebody thought in their infinite wisdom, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1578.7s)]
*  we're just gonna let him be the NRCC chair. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1580.74s)]
*  A total dud votes against me. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1584.14s)]
*  Then you have the Mormon out of Utah. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1586.38s)]
*  I have such contempt for some of these people [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1591.3400000000001s)]
*  that I forgot their names. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1593.1000000000001s)]
*  Fair. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1594.54s)]
*  He's the deputy conference chair. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1596.38s)]
*  Can't remember his name. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1598.66s)]
*  I know he's super tall. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1599.6200000000001s)]
*  He votes for, he votes to expel me. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1601.26s)]
*  So you lose the tall guy. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1602.98s)]
*  I lose the tall guy. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1604.8999999999999s)]
*  Then Lisa McLean, who up until the moment of the vote, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1605.74s)]
*  she's like, this is so unfair, honey, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1607.5s)]
*  what they're doing to you, votes to expel me. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1609.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm like, wait, what the hell just happened? [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1611.6599999999999s)]
*  Never looked at her in the face again. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1614.8999999999999s)]
*  So this is leadership. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1616.86s)]
*  Leadership fractured. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1618.82s)]
*  And it gave people a window to say, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1620.1799999999998s)]
*  well, some of leadership went sideways. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1622.78s)]
*  We're just gonna go with that band of leadership. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1625.1399999999999s)]
*  But in the end, as you know, you served in the body. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1627.98s)]
*  If the speaker said, no, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1630.98s)]
*  we're not gonna let Democrats kick out this guy [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1633.42s)]
*  for stuff that we all know is pretty common. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1636.42s)]
*  And by the way, if it's a crime, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1639.8200000000002s)]
*  the courts will make that judgment. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1641.02s)]
*  That was the only thing I argued with them. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1642.66s)]
*  So if Mike Johnson had said that, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1644.54s)]
*  you would have been fine. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1646.8200000000002s)]
*  Why didn't he say that? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1647.66s)]
*  Michael guest recently at an event in Mississippi [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1651.06s)]
*  told a person, and for the sakes of that person's privacy, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1653.66s)]
*  because he entrusted him with that, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1656.94s)]
*  he flat out said it was political [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1658.42s)]
*  because they had pulled the neighboring districts [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1660.34s)]
*  and they were getting slaughtered because of me. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1663.86s)]
*  I find that very hard to believe [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1666.22s)]
*  because I was still being able to go back home, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1667.8999999999999s)]
*  do my district work. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1670.1399999999999s)]
*  In the middle of all of that, Tucker, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1671.86s)]
*  I did constituent work. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1673.6999999999998s)]
*  I was doing town halls. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1675.06s)]
*  I was doing mobile office hours. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1677.02s)]
*  I worked through it. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1679.26s)]
*  These guys were all scared of doing anything [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1681.78s)]
*  because my name was gonna come up. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1683.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, just say I'm not George Santos. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1685.3s)]
*  If you have issues with George Santos, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1686.8999999999999s)]
*  go visit George Santos's office. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1688.02s)]
*  That's it. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1689.6999999999998s)]
*  But they took it personal and they made it personal [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1690.54s)]
*  and it's fine and here we are, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1694.3799999999999s)]
*  but that's why I got expelled. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1696.1s)]
*  So did you know Mike Johnson? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1697.82s)]
*  I knew Mike Johnson from the fact that me and Lauren Boeber [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1699.8999999999999s)]
*  harassed him to run for speaker [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1703.74s)]
*  while we were going through that entire debacle. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1705.86s)]
*  That was unbelievable. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1708.02s)]
*  I was coming out of the- [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1709.06s)]
*  So McCarthy's, can you just walk us through it [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1710.62s)]
*  for those of us who've forgotten the details? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1711.9799999999998s)]
*  McCarthy gets vacated. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1713.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1714.86s)]
*  And the one thing I hold till this day in my year [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1715.7s)]
*  from that day was Nancy Mace. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1719.3s)]
*  Nobody knew what she was doing. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1722.62s)]
*  And all of a sudden- [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1723.9399999999998s)]
*  What's Nancy Mace? [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1725.7s)]
*  Nancy Mace. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1727.4199999999998s)]
*  Just kidding, I love that name. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1728.26s)]
*  All I remember is her very, it felt visceral. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1730.78s)]
*  She screams an I that I'm never going to forget [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1736.8999999999999s)]
*  the strength she used to say I for vacating him. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1741.94s)]
*  It echoed and permeated through the halls [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1745.66s)]
*  and through the chamber and you could hear a pin drop [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1748.5800000000002s)]
*  because nobody saw that coming. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1751.74s)]
*  That was a final nail in his coffin. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1753.46s)]
*  Wow. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1755.3400000000001s)]
*  And I sat there- [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1756.18s)]
*  Nancy Mace growled an I. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1757.02s)]
*  With every fiber in her being, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1759.3000000000002s)]
*  I looked, I remember looking at Corey Mills' face [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1762.8200000000002s)]
*  and going like, what the just happened? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  He's like, this changes everything. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1768.74s)]
*  We were just so caught off guard [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1772.54s)]
*  because now from M onwards to Z, right? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1774.78s)]
*  Mace and Alpha, anything can happen. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1777.82s)]
*  Anything can happen. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1782.82s)]
*  And I sat there just like pondering, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1784.82s)]
*  like what is happening, right? [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1787.14s)]
*  So that happens. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1790.02s)]
*  We instantly get pulled into conference. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1791.94s)]
*  We've now, you know, you look at Steve Volmack's face [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1794.5800000000002s)]
*  hitting the gavel and saying the office of the speaker [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1798.58s)]
*  is now vacant, one eye squinting, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1802.74s)]
*  the other eye almost bogging out of his skull. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1804.82s)]
*  I remember looking at Volmack's face [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1807.78s)]
*  and looking around like, did this just really happen? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1810.02s)]
*  I'm like, when history couldn't be made even more, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1813.02s)]
*  but did this just really happen? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1816.3s)]
*  And I'm, from my purview, I'm like, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1817.78s)]
*  oh my God, I'm not the drama anymore. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1820.1399999999999s)]
*  This is so, for six weeks, I felt so relieved. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1821.78s)]
*  I'm sorry, Kevin, but I just felt so relieved. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1829.5s)]
*  It was not on me anymore. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1832.34s)]
*  This is about Gates and Kevin. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1833.58s)]
*  And I don't know if you remember the baby story, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1835.62s)]
*  me carrying a baby and screaming at a Hamas protester. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1837.6599999999999s)]
*  So that all happened in that, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1841.82s)]
*  I was just hanging out with babies at that point [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1844.94s)]
*  because nobody cared about me. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1846.94s)]
*  But we all now get transferred to doing our conference [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1848.42s)]
*  meetings in the Ways and Means Committee room, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1851.8999999999999s)]
*  which is in the Longworth office building [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1854.6599999999999s)]
*  right off of Constitution Avenue. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1856.42s)]
*  My office was just down the hall. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1859.1000000000001s)]
*  So I was like a two minute walk. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1860.78s)]
*  I joke, my office became the hideaway bar [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1862.82s)]
*  for some of my colleagues. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1867.9s)]
*  So we were going there and we're doing these votes [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1869.38s)]
*  behind closed doors. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1874.18s)]
*  And all I kept thinking was how much I hated it [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1875.7s)]
*  when I would be on the outside and read about it. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1879.58s)]
*  They're all now gathered behind closed doors voting on this. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1882.66s)]
*  I said, the hell with the closed doors narrative. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1885.22s)]
*  I went to X and I started going [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1887.42s)]
*  and telling people play by play. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1889.8600000000001s)]
*  They were sequestering our phones. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1891.54s)]
*  I said, I'm a fucking congressman, sorry. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1892.74s)]
*  No, you were a fucking congressman. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1895.26s)]
*  I literally said, you're not taking my phone. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1897.42s)]
*  Enough of this shit, no more babysitting. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1899.3400000000001s)]
*  And I was just texting, live texting from in there. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1901.26s)]
*  Then I started going out there and joining spaces. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1903.1000000000001s)]
*  And there's some space hosts out there, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1905.9s)]
*  Diligent Denizen and James and Shell Shock. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1908.14s)]
*  These guys were hosting these spaces and Lou. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1911.38s)]
*  And I'm just giving it to them in real time. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1914.74s)]
*  And the numbers started piling up with the audiences, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1918.22s)]
*  tens of thousands of people listening. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1921.3s)]
*  This is the first time a member of Congress is deflecting [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1923.5s)]
*  from the entire conference and telling them [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1927.34s)]
*  what's happening behind closed doors, play by play. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1929.3799999999999s)]
*  Who's voting for what, what fights are getting to, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1931.58s)]
*  what propositions are being offered. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1933.6599999999999s)]
*  Even McCarthy's navigation trying to go back [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1936.26s)]
*  into the speaker's office. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1939.4199999999998s)]
*  There was a lot of those deals being cut. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1940.82s)]
*  Did you know that at one point, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1942.4199999999998s)]
*  there was an offer of a co-speakership [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1943.8999999999999s)]
*  between McCarthy and Jim Jordan? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1945.78s)]
*  That was an actual thing. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1947.78s)]
*  That was on the table. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1949.1399999999999s)]
*  Like Jim will be the speaker and I will be co-speaker [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1950.4599999999998s)]
*  with him and we'll share the office. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1954.2199999999998s)]
*  This was offered, you know? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1959.3799999999999s)]
*  So I'm telling people this and people couldn't believe it. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1961.3s)]
*  So then we go through round one, it's Jim Jordan [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1964.62s)]
*  and it's Steve Scalise. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1968.2199999999998s)]
*  And I personally, I was very clear about this at the time. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1969.26s)]
*  Scalise, who I look up to him tremendously, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1972.98s)]
*  was going through cancer treatment. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1975.38s)]
*  And I said, come hell or high water, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1976.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm not voting for a man going through cancer treatment. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1978.42s)]
*  This job will kill him faster. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1980.98s)]
*  Yeah, it's not good for him or the country. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1983.06s)]
*  It's not good for him or the country. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1983.9s)]
*  I said, it's not smart. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1985.38s)]
*  I don't think he ever quite understood that. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1987.5800000000002s)]
*  I did it from a place of love [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1989.6200000000001s)]
*  and I think he took it personal and that's okay. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1990.98s)]
*  That's totally fine. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1992.94s)]
*  So sometimes when people sell products on TV, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1994.26s)]
*  you know, I love this product, I use this product. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1996.9s)]
*  There's the question in the mind of the viewer, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=1999.02s)]
*  does this guy really use the product? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2001.5s)]
*  Does he really love the product? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2003.38s)]
*  Would he keep the product at home? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2004.74s)]
*  Ask my dogs. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2006.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2007.42s)]
*  Now we are in a garage. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2008.26s)]
*  I'm not gonna tell you where it is because again, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2010.74s)]
*  this is prepping, but this is my garage. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2012.82s)]
*  There's a gun safe. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2016.3400000000001s)]
*  And this is a part of my stockpile of Ready Hour. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2017.18s)]
*  Completely real. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2020.7s)]
*  The second I put it here, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2022.06s)]
*  the second Ready Hour sent it to me, I felt peace of mind [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2023.54s)]
*  because no matter what happens, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2027.6200000000001s)]
*  we're not going hungry in my house. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2029.38s)]
*  I moved a lot of fishing gear out of the way [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2030.8999999999999s)]
*  to keep it in my garage. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2033.1s)]
*  And ever since it's been here, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2034.4599999999998s)]
*  I have felt the peace of mind that comes from knowing [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2036.58s)]
*  my family's not going hungry no matter what. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2038.74s)]
*  The lastcountrysupply.com, lastcountrysupply.com, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2040.6999999999998s)]
*  it can be in your garage along with the peace of mind [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2044.78s)]
*  that comes with having it. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2046.78s)]
*  And then Jim Jordan, there was a Jim Jordan aspect of it. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2049.3399999999997s)]
*  We went to the floor three times for Jim Jordan [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2052.62s)]
*  and I voted for Jim Jordan. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2054.7s)]
*  I liked Jim, Jim's a great guy. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2055.8599999999997s)]
*  I had personal meeting with him, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2057.9s)]
*  but it wasn't moving. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2060.3s)]
*  So when I saw that it started to fall apart, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2061.5800000000004s)]
*  I started lobbying Mike Johnson. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2064.02s)]
*  Quiet in the corners, like, no, no, no, George, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2066.34s)]
*  I could never, these guys are like two big brothers to me. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2068.7400000000002s)]
*  And I said, Mike, you're the only person in here [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2070.98s)]
*  that nobody dislikes. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2073.7400000000002s)]
*  Like you're the nicest member of Congress. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2075.34s)]
*  Nobody has an issue with you. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2077.78s)]
*  You're the only one that can get a consensus. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2079.02s)]
*  He's like, I could never do this to them. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2080.5s)]
*  Then Tom Emmer tried, poor Tom. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2082.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the marriage equality vote completely ruined him [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2084.42s)]
*  with the conference, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2088.1800000000003s)]
*  especially with the more Christian base, right? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2089.02s)]
*  You're Bob Goods of the world, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2091.74s)]
*  but never vote for him, right? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2093.1s)]
*  So that went down in a ball of flame. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2095.94s)]
*  And then the jungle primary started, the jungle rounds. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2097.78s)]
*  There was like six of them up there from Dan Muser to- [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2100.7s)]
*  Byron. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2104.9s)]
*  Byron, and I love Byron. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2105.74s)]
*  Byron's like a great friend. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2107.94s)]
*  I was very conflicted at that point [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2111.98s)]
*  because here's the guy I lobbied [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2113.62s)]
*  and harassed to jump in the race in the race. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2114.82s)]
*  And here's a friend of mine. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2116.62s)]
*  But I also said at the time, I said to him point blank, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2118.22s)]
*  you're my friend, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2121.7799999999997s)]
*  but I don't think you've been here long enough [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2122.62s)]
*  to be speaker. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2124.1s)]
*  I think it will eat you up [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2124.98s)]
*  and you have so much more to offer, right? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2126.18s)]
*  And I didn't want him to compromise on his values [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2129.62s)]
*  because you do have to compromise somewhat as speaker. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2131.5s)]
*  But I didn't expect Mike to completely [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2134.8199999999997s)]
*  just throw his values away. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2136.74s)]
*  Mike Johnson, the morning he decided to jump in the race, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2139.8599999999997s)]
*  sends me a text message and says to the tune of, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2142.2999999999997s)]
*  George, I just wanted to say thank you for the encouragement. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2144.8599999999997s)]
*  I've decided to jump in the race. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2147.1s)]
*  I hope I still have your support. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2148.7799999999997s)]
*  My answer to him is, let's go, you know, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2150.46s)]
*  like muscle emoji, let's kick ass. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2152.7s)]
*  I call Lauren Boebert, dead ass o'clock in the morning. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2156.22s)]
*  She's like, somebody die. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2159.62s)]
*  I'm like, no, Mike Johnson's jumping in the race. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2160.7s)]
*  She's like, woo hoo, we're like celebrating. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2162.3399999999997s)]
*  And from that point forward, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2164.38s)]
*  we were his apostles for the MAGA base. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2165.7799999999997s)]
*  Cause we, the two of us were on spaces [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2168.7799999999997s)]
*  and then Matt Gaetz joined promoting him. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2171.58s)]
*  People had no clue who Mike Johnson was. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2174.58s)]
*  And we educated them. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2177.78s)]
*  So that was my little role there throughout that experiment, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2178.62s)]
*  I guess I call it. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2183.18s)]
*  Cause that was an experiment. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2184.02s)]
*  When was that? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2185.3s)]
*  September, September of 2023. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2186.34s)]
*  It was, it went from September throughout October, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2188.86s)]
*  early November. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2193.46s)]
*  It was, it was a nightmare. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2195.14s)]
*  And then he got it. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2197.66s)]
*  And then he got it. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2198.62s)]
*  And about a week or two later was Thanksgiving break. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2199.46s)]
*  Now here's the guy. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2203.5s)]
*  Week or two after he becomes speaker. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2204.34s)]
*  He becomes speaker. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2205.82s)]
*  Now here's the guy who I lobby like hell, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2207.54s)]

*  propping him up on social media, [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2212.46s)]
*  become speaker. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2215.3399999999997s)]
*  And I'm sitting in my bathtub, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2216.22s)]
*  having a glass of wine. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2218.58s)]
*  It's Thanksgiving weekend. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2219.7799999999997s)]
*  And I got a call from the speaker and, you know, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2222.02s)]
*  naturally you wouldn't answer. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2224.2999999999997s)]
*  I said, I was just, Tucker, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2225.54s)]
*  have you ever been over something so much [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2227.8999999999996s)]
*  that you were just like, I don't care anymore about decorum? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2229.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to answer this. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2232.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes, I have. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2233.46s)]
*  I just answered the speaker's phone call, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2234.3s)]
*  butt naked in a tub. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2238.7400000000002s)]
*  Did you tell him you're butt naked? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2239.94s)]
*  I did tell him I was in the tub. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2241.38s)]
*  Like, you know, Mr. Speaker, right now, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2242.6600000000003s)]
*  I it's put up or shut up [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2245.2200000000003s)]
*  because I'm enjoying a bubble bath with wine. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2246.98s)]
*  He said, I'll pray for you. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2250.46s)]
*  But he was trying to convince me to resign. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2254.0600000000004s)]
*  What do you mean resign? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2256.2200000000003s)]
*  He said, why don't you resign? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2257.0600000000004s)]
*  So this doesn't stay on your record forever [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2258.82s)]
*  and you leave in your own terms. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2261.1800000000003s)]
*  And I said, Mr. Speaker. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2262.98s)]
*  But you had just helped get him elected speaker [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2264.1800000000003s)]
*  and then a week later he calls and says, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2266.1800000000003s)]
*  why don't you resign your seat? [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2267.54s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2268.6600000000003s)]
*  Cause he's trying to sell it to me as if it's good for me. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2270.1800000000003s)]
*  That sounds great. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2275.1000000000004s)]
*  It sounds great. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2276.02s)]
*  Quick, quick. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2277.1800000000003s)]
*  Lose your job. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2278.02s)]
*  Yeah, it's awesome. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2278.86s)]
*  Lose the job you blew your entire life to get [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2279.7000000000003s)]
*  and not even fulfill the entire term. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2281.6600000000003s)]
*  Sounds like a great deal, Mr. Speaker. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2283.42s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2285.34s)]
*  I told him put up or shut up. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2286.3s)]
*  You can tell the guys I said that cause I'm not leaving. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2288.2200000000003s)]
*  They're going to have to kick me out [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2290.34s)]
*  and they proceeded to do so. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2291.26s)]
*  How long after that did they kick you out? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2293.5400000000004s)]
*  December 1st. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2296.1400000000003s)]
*  So I want to say two weeks after Mike Johnson [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2297.46s)]
*  became speaker, this was Thanksgiving weekend. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2300.0200000000004s)]
*  So six days later. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2301.94s)]
*  So he obviously knew, I mean, let's be honest. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2304.82s)]
*  He knew they were going to kick you out. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2306.86s)]
*  I remember calling guy Russian thaler [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2309.46s)]
*  who I love Pennsylvania congressman, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2311.46s)]
*  young guy, completely overrated. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2314.7000000000003s)]
*  He would be a great speaker, super young, dynamic. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2316.34s)]
*  He's a deputy whip to Emmer. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2320.38s)]
*  And I remember calling him and I said, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2322.5s)]
*  guy, can I just ask you a question? [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2323.94s)]
*  He's like, what? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2325.26s)]
*  He's like, do you guys have the number? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2326.1000000000004s)]
*  They're like, do they have them? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2328.1400000000003s)]
*  He's like, I don't think so, George. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2328.98s)]
*  I don't think there's an appetite for this. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2330.6600000000003s)]
*  I said, all right, I think they do. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2332.7000000000003s)]
*  He's like, what makes you say that? [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2334.26s)]
*  I'm like gut feeling. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2335.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2337.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2338.2200000000003s)]
*  It's like three times the charm. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2339.06s)]
*  I had gone through this exercise two times prior. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2340.1800000000003s)]
*  So I sat there and I just said, I think they have it. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2342.9s)]
*  He's like, I'm going to run some traps and see the numbers. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2346.78s)]
*  The day of I'm on the house floor [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2350.86s)]
*  and the numbers are counting, the numbers are counting. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2352.3s)]
*  Then there was a stall and it didn't seem to budge. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2354.46s)]
*  And I'll get back to why it budged. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2358.9s)]
*  There's a big reason why it budged. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2361.1s)]
*  There's a stall. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2363.94s)]
*  And I looked at guy and I said, this isn't looking good. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2365.46s)]
*  Look at how many people haven't voted that are in here [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2369.5s)]
*  just talking to one another. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2371.82s)]
*  And he's like, no, no, no, they're just reasoning. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2373.38s)]
*  Trust me, this isn't going to happen. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2375.42s)]
*  And it happened. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2376.74s)]
*  It happened in a glorious way for those who cheered [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2377.58s)]
*  for me to be expelled. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2382.2999999999997s)]
*  People were clapping as... [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2383.5s)]
*  And you're standing there? [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2386.74s)]
*  Oh, I stood there. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2388.1s)]
*  The moment I saw- [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2388.94s)]
*  While your colleagues clapped for your expulsion? [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2390.14s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2392.66s)]
*  The moment I started walking down the aisle, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2393.5s)]
*  as Kenneth Cole put it, I wore an expulsion chic outfit. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2395.5s)]
*  I wore it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2398.74s)]
*  Kenneth Cole said, well, he understood the assignment. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2404.38s)]
*  He wore an expulsion chic. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2406.54s)]
*  Had the coat over my shoulder because it was a heavy coat [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2407.86s)]
*  and I didn't want to have to hustle with it [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2409.94s)]
*  to get in the car. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2412.1s)]
*  So I had a kind of like a quick way out, right? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2412.94s)]
*  My car was waiting at the Capitol steps for me. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2415.86s)]
*  And it was just, that was it. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2418.7s)]
*  Very anticlimactic, but- [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2421.38s)]
*  Did you get to clean out your office? [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2423.02s)]
*  Do you know what I did? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2425.14s)]
*  I stayed in DC for Thanksgiving break [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2426.42s)]
*  because I had a gut feeling. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2429.46s)]
*  I emptied my office out on the weekend of Thanksgiving [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2431.34s)]
*  when nobody was there to see it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2433.54s)]
*  So the one thing I never gave the media, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2435.1s)]
*  I never gave them the George Santos carrying boxes [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2437.58s)]
*  out of his office. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2439.9s)]
*  I never, because I looked at my partner and I said, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  I think they're gonna win this time. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2443.7s)]
*  And to preserve some dignity, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2445.22s)]
*  I'm not gonna give them the defeated vision [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2448.2999999999997s)]
*  of me carrying boxes. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2450.5s)]
*  But it seems clear to me, I don't know, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2452.14s)]
*  but from what you've said, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2454.38s)]
*  that when Mike Johnson called you a week after you helped [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2455.94s)]
*  get him elected speaker to say you should resign, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2458.58s)]
*  he knew that he was, that you were on your way out [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2460.7799999999997s)]
*  and that he was gonna play, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2464.14s)]
*  he clearly played a role in that. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2465.02s)]
*  That was literally the reason I decided to empty my office. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2466.7s)]
*  So was that call? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2469.06s)]
*  It was that call, yes. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2470.7s)]
*  So why wouldn't he just be straightforward with you? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2472.14s)]
*  It sounds like he's lying. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2475.2599999999998s)]
*  Because it's politics. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2476.62s)]
*  I know, but you can't tell someone [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2477.74s)]
*  you're gonna pray for them and then lie. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2479.58s)]
*  You can't- [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2482.14s)]
*  The very Christian of him. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2482.98s)]
*  It's not, it's not. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2483.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just not. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2485.02s)]
*  You can't invoke God and then lie. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2485.86s)]
*  Like that's not, you don't do that. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2488.86s)]
*  That's not a good idea. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2490.3399999999997s)]
*  But I've learned one thing about these people in Congress. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2492.02s)]
*  It wasn't very Christian of him then, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2494.34s)]
*  just like it wasn't very Mormon of Mitt Romney [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2496.06s)]
*  calling me a sick puppy. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2498.1800000000003s)]
*  So it wasn't very Mormon of him [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2500.42s)]
*  to be so demeaning towards me. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2502.86s)]
*  So, or tell me- [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2504.7400000000002s)]
*  Mitt Romney called you a sick puppy? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2505.58s)]
*  Oh, he told me to sit in the back of the room [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2506.54s)]
*  that if I were to stay that I should serve in shame [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2508.1s)]
*  in the back of the room. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2510.7400000000002s)]
*  I said, nobody puts baby in the back of the room. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2511.58s)]
*  That's not very Mormon of you. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2513.82s)]
*  And he called me an ass and I called him, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2515.7400000000002s)]
*  it's a very famous exchange between us [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2517.42s)]
*  at the State of the Union. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2519.7000000000003s)]
*  Because it's my first State of the Union. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2520.98s)]
*  Yes, I was center aisle seat. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2523.02s)]
*  I saved that seat. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2525.2200000000003s)]
*  And Tim Burchett says, well, you fought for this seat. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2526.78s)]
*  You keep this seat. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2529.38s)]
*  I'm not moving. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2530.54s)]
*  Burchett said that? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2531.66s)]
*  Oh, I'm so glad you're telling me this. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2533.3s)]
*  Again, I'm not endorsing anything. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2535.3s)]
*  I'm not, all I'm endorsing is decency toward other people. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2537.46s)]
*  And I got a lot of that from him. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2541.06s)]
*  And I'm attacking self-righteousness, which I hate. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2541.9s)]
*  And it's always a sign of rottenness. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2544.66s)]
*  I'm not a choir boy. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2546.62s)]
*  I don't make representations to be one. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2548.06s)]
*  I am flawed. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2550.46s)]
*  I have made stupid decisions that I regret profoundly. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2551.38s)]
*  Why do you think Burchett was so kind to you? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2554.38s)]
*  Because I don't think, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2557.98s)]
*  it's not like his constituents are the same as your constituents. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2558.82s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2561.1s)]
*  Tim Burchett is a special man [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2562.66s)]
*  in more ways than one can explain. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2564.86s)]
*  I would equate it to him just being a good human being, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2568.1s)]
*  a good following Christian [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2572.2200000000003s)]
*  that actually follows Christianity. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2574.1s)]
*  I believe that. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2576.38s)]
*  Because he reached out to me through Marjorie Taylor Greene [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2577.2200000000003s)]
*  on December 22nd, 2022, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2581.34s)]
*  after I had taken two anti-depressants [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2582.9s)]
*  after I walked out of the Fox News van [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2585.98s)]
*  and got my ass handed to me by Tulsi Cabert on your show. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2587.86s)]
*  I wasn't there that day. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2592.1400000000003s)]
*  I love Tulsi as you know, but that was not my position. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2593.94s)]
*  She was sitting in for me that day. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2597.06s)]
*  No, that's totally fine. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2598.46s)]
*  And I hold no animosity. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2599.3s)]
*  Clearly I'm not her friend, but. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2600.6600000000003s)]
*  No, that became clear in the course of the interview. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2602.98s)]
*  But it was Marjorie. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2606.82s)]
*  She's like, that was rough. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2609.82s)]
*  I said, I didn't watch it. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2611.02s)]
*  I experienced it. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2612.38s)]
*  I don't need to watch it to know it was rough. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2613.2200000000003s)]
*  So she's like, Tim Burchett from Tennessee [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2615.46s)]
*  really wants to talk to you. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2618.0600000000004s)]
*  Can I give him your number? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2619.1800000000003s)]
*  I said, sure. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2620.1400000000003s)]
*  I didn't even know who or what a Tim Burchett was. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2621.1800000000003s)]
*  And this man comes on the phone and is so kind. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2624.7400000000002s)]
*  And so he extended not just the hand, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2627.6200000000003s)]
*  he extended like a actual body for you to know you can rely. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2631.1400000000003s)]
*  And believe it or not, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2636.18s)]
*  we end up being diagonally positioned [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2637.62s)]
*  from one another in our offices. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2639.46s)]
*  It's like maybe 40 feet away from his door. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2641.42s)]
*  Wow. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2644.2599999999998s)]
*  And I took advantage of that [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2645.1s)]
*  because that's where I would run for refuge many times [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2646.18s)]
*  and seek counseling guidance from him. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2648.2599999999998s)]
*  And he was always there, arms wide open. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2650.5s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2652.74s)]
*  I don't think most people watch this [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2653.58s)]
*  know who Tim Burchett is. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2654.54s)]
*  I happen to know for another reason. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2655.3799999999997s)]
*  And I really don't like most members, but I do like him. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2657.1s)]
*  One of the kindest human beings you'll probably interact with. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2661.1s)]
*  I'm thrilled to hear that. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2663.3399999999997s)]
*  So you get elected to Congress. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2664.22s)]
*  What are your first impressions of it? [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2666.7799999999997s)]
*  What did you expect and what did you find? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2668.94s)]
*  I've learned one thing for the sake of the American people. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2671.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not a serious place. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2674.22s)]
*  It's essentially an overpaid [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2675.46s)]
*  and a very expensive high school. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2677.2599999999998s)]
*  That's the energy. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2679.46s)]
*  I mean, people are pulling fire alarms. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2680.7s)]
*  People are yelling at each other on the Capitol steps. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2683.2599999999998s)]
*  They're the stoners, the preppy. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2685.94s)]
*  It's just so bad. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2688.2599999999998s)]
*  And then there's the fashionistas, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2689.98s)]
*  which was the first time I saw them. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2691.18s)]
*  And then there's the fashionistas, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2692.74s)]
*  which was I was alone in that category. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2693.8999999999996s)]
*  I felt so alone. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2696.58s)]
*  I couldn't even get one of the lady Congresswomen [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2697.74s)]
*  to like join me on that. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2699.9399999999996s)]
*  Like they're all so dull. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2701.06s)]
*  I mean, I'll give Annapollina, she's kind of spicy. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2702.3799999999997s)]
*  She'll put her dad's ties on him. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2705.1s)]
*  I'm like, okay, that's a look, you know? [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2707.3399999999997s)]
*  But we had fun, you know? [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2710.66s)]
*  But it was just so, it's not serious. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2712.66s)]
*  Tucker, I'm fun, okay? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2716.1s)]
*  I have a self-deprecating sense of humor. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2718.2599999999998s)]
*  I am larger than life, but I know how to be serious. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2722.14s)]
*  When serious is required, I will sit there. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2724.38s)]
*  I will freaking give you spreadsheet charts [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2727.18s)]
*  of all the analysis as I did of a lot of the spending pork [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2729.74s)]
*  and the spending porn that was going on. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2734.18s)]
*  And I would present this to the entire conference. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2736.2999999999997s)]
*  I'd say like, just read this over. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2738.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm being serious. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2739.98s)]
*  Are we seriously, are we serious about our jobs [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2740.8199999999997s)]
*  or are we just doing messaging? [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2743.14s)]
*  Because at that point I learned 95% of Congress, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2744.54s)]
*  at least in my time there, was messaging. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2747.98s)]
*  Nothing was serious. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2750.5s)]
*  The only time they were serious was when the Uniparty joined [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2752.94s)]
*  and passed their pork, Scrupulous CRs. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2755.98s)]
*  And I remember asking Mike Johnson this on the floor once. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2759.74s)]
*  Mike, why are we going on recess? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2763.94s)]
*  It's July of 2023. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2766.2599999999998s)]
*  And we don't have the 12 individual spending bills [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2768.54s)]
*  out of the Appropriations Committee. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2771.54s)]
*  What's K. Granger doing? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2774.02s)]
*  He's like, oh, it's not K. Granger's fault. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2775.06s)]
*  Ask your speaker. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2777.94s)]
*  And I said, wait, what? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2780.2599999999998s)]
*  And I proceed to go to one of Kevin's staffers. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2782.9s)]
*  I'm like, why am I hearing that the speaker told K. Granger [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2786.02s)]
*  not to progress with the 12 individual spending bills? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2789.58s)]
*  Oh, George, don't worry. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2795.02s)]
*  It's so complicated, but we're almost there. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2796.02s)]
*  Well, first of all, now in hindsight, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2799.3s)]
*  we know we had a senile chairwoman in K. Granger [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2800.94s)]
*  who before she ended her term, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2805.58s)]
*  she went into a mental health care facility for seniors. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2807.82s)]
*  She was like wandering around Texas, lost. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2812.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2814.7000000000003s)]
*  The actual, you know, when they talk about [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2816.98s)]
*  the power of the purse, she holds the goddamn purse. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2819.46s)]
*  She was senile. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2823.02s)]
*  And she was in a memory care facility. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2824.02s)]
*  She was in a memory care facility. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2825.1400000000003s)]
*  And I empathize with that and I feel bad. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2826.42s)]
*  Of course, no one's mocking her. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2829.1400000000003s)]
*  But that's a coverup. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2830.58s)]
*  But so why would the speaker allow her [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2832.98s)]
*  to be chairman of the Appropriations Committee? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2834.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the coverup. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2836.54s)]
*  Mike Johnson knew of this after he became speaker. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2838.54s)]
*  And so did Steve Scalise, which I like. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2843.14s)]
*  And so did Elise Stefanik. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2845.46s)]
*  Leadership knew she was absent for six months. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2846.86s)]
*  Her staff was still receiving pay without doing any work. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2849.5s)]
*  This is government corruption 101. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2853.58s)]
*  I'm gonna call it out on both sides. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2856.38s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2858.34s)]
*  And you should. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2859.18s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2860.02s)]
*  Nobody's throwing themselves for me to save me. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2860.86s)]
*  I'm going to prison for seven years. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2863.22s)]
*  The only person that can help me is Donald Trump, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2865.06s)]
*  if he chooses to. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2866.82s)]
*  At that, there's a bunch of people telling him not to. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2868.7799999999997s)]
*  So why am I gonna be kind to these people [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2871.22s)]
*  and not say the truth? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2873.74s)]
*  Why, you should be. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2874.58s)]
*  The truth will set me free, Tucker. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2875.5s)]
*  That's how I look at it. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2877.02s)]
*  I totally agree with that. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2877.86s)]
*  So when you go back to that [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2878.94s)]
*  and I'm having this conversation with Mike Johnson, [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2880.98s)]
*  that's where I also picked up a lot of respect for him [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2883.54s)]
*  because he didn't mince his words. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2885.9s)]
*  But we find ourselves in this place that is not serious. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2887.94s)]
*  They're not serious about passing a balanced budget. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2892.62s)]
*  I've noticed. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2895.2999999999997s)]
*  They're not serious about cutting. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2896.18s)]
*  I mean, Elon Musk blew half of his fortune [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2898.02s)]
*  by joining the government and going [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2901.62s)]
*  and being the chair of DOGE. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2903.7s)]
*  For what? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2906.3799999999997s)]
*  None of those cuts have been codified by Congress. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2907.74s)]
*  We're re-appropriating some of these cuts [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2910.98s)]
*  that were identified. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2913.3399999999997s)]
*  We never get rid of NPR funding. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2914.18s)]
*  No. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2915.9s)]
*  I mean, sure. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2916.9s)]
*  The only good thing that comes out of public broadcasting [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2918.14s)]
*  funded by the, it's Big Bird and Elmo. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2920.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2922.94s)]
*  See, the only good. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2923.7799999999997s)]
*  Who are a little creepy if you think about it, but. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2925.06s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2927.2599999999998s)]
*  Aren't we all creepy? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2928.1s)]
*  To someone. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2928.94s)]
*  To someone. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2929.78s)]
*  To someone who are creepy. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2930.62s)]
*  Who is it that has nightmares about you? [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2933.46s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2936.2599999999998s)]
*  The actress? [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2937.08s)]
*  Oh, that's right. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2937.92s)]
*  Probably more than one. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2938.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2939.98s)]
*  But you get what I'm saying. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2940.82s)]
*  I tell you, I know I'm creepy to people [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2941.66s)]
*  because they tell me on X. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2943.98s)]
*  So we're all a little creepy. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2945.42s)]
*  Did you find creepy people in Congress? [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2947.9s)]
*  Oh, tons. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2949.7s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2950.9s)]
*  Purvey. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2951.74s)]
*  I mean. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2952.56s)]
*  Well, actually, purvey. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2953.4s)]
*  Seriously. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2955.7s)]
*  I mean. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2956.54s)]
*  If, look, I'm not in the business [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2957.38s)]
*  of throwing friends under the bus. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2959.38s)]
*  But in confidence, I've had actually reporters come to me [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2961.38s)]
*  and tell me of how members invite them to their offices. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2964.48s)]
*  Oh, I have a scoop for you and then make moves on them. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2967.78s)]
*  In the office. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2970.66s)]
*  In the office. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2971.5s)]
*  In their office. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2972.34s)]
*  There's some weird sex stuff going on in Congress now. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2973.18s)]
*  I keep hearing about this. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2975.46s)]
*  Is that, was that your experience? [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2976.94s)]
*  My experience was that it's a dirty place. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2978.66s)]
*  I bought up to, I can't believe I'm giving all of this. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2981.18s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2984.18s)]
*  But I keep hearing this from members that I know. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2985.02s)]
*  And it's like, really? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2987.42s)]
*  I bought up to Brian Stile, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2988.54s)]
*  the chairman of the admin committee. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2990.14s)]
*  One of my staffers, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2993.6s)]
*  there's something called the cages in Congress, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2996.2599999999998s)]
*  which is a storage unit for us, right? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=2998.54s)]
*  Those are the congressional cages. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3000.42s)]
*  Underneath. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3002.02s)]
*  Underneath in the basement [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3002.86s)]
*  of every congressional house office building. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3003.86s)]
*  So I was in Longworth and we're like, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3006.74s)]
*  there's some stuff in the cages [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3009.3s)]
*  we might want to go check before we order supplies. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3010.3s)]
*  And I'm like, the cages, that sounds pretty racy. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3012.46s)]
*  What's that? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3016.1s)]
*  They're like, oh no, boss, it's the storage unit. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3016.94s)]
*  I'm like, oh, okay, let me go there with you guys. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3019.06s)]
*  He's like, no, boss, you shouldn't go there. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3021.14s)]
*  I'm like, why? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3022.86s)]
*  And he's like, well, you know, there's some rumors. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3024.02s)]
*  People are going out, down there and having sex. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3027.42s)]
*  I'm like, wait, is this serious? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3029.98s)]
*  So I know a few other staffers from other members. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3032.7400000000002s)]
*  So I went to some chief of staffs [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3035.46s)]
*  that I've known from the campaign time. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3036.78s)]
*  When you're campaigning, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3038.62s)]
*  you're talking a lot more to chiefs [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3039.5s)]
*  than you are to staff, to the actual member. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3040.82s)]
*  So you built those relationships as a freshman. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3043.1800000000003s)]
*  So I knew a couple of chiefs. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3045.1000000000004s)]
*  And they're like, yeah, it happens. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3046.1000000000004s)]
*  What am I going to do? [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3049.42s)]
*  Be the cock blocker, the sex police? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3050.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't have time for that. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3053.86s)]
*  I'm like, there's no remedy to this? [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3055.1800000000003s)]
*  They're like, no, I'm like, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3056.82s)]
*  why don't we put cameras down there to create deterrence? [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3057.6600000000003s)]
*  So I approached this novel idea, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3061.6200000000003s)]
*  which is like, we're talking about, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3063.2200000000003s)]
*  it's only like maybe six cameras [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3064.42s)]
*  in each one of these sections to Brian Stile. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3066.2200000000003s)]
*  And he says, oh, we don't have time [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3069.1400000000003s)]
*  to focus on this. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3070.42s)]
*  This is all based on baseless rumors. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3071.26s)]
*  Then I learn that former members were caught having sex [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3073.1800000000003s)]
*  with staffers down in the cages. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3076.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's why cameras will never go up. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3078.06s)]
*  No way. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3079.9s)]
*  So this is what we're dealing with. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3081.62s)]
*  I mean, the last place on earth [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3083.98s)]
*  I ever thought I'd have to deal with sex scandals [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3086.02s)]
*  was in the government building. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3087.98s)]
*  But why in the government building? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3090.42s)]
*  Like everyone has a house, right? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3091.98s)]
*  Can I tell you something? [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3093.58s)]
*  I think part of it is this dominance fetish problem [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3094.6600000000003s)]
*  that they have in DC. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3098.1s)]
*  Interesting. What is that? [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3099.46s)]
*  It's the power. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3100.3s)]
*  Like we're in Congress. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3102.02s)]
*  I'm a staffer of the Hill [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3103.7400000000002s)]
*  and you're coming here to service me. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3106.02s)]
*  That's the mentality. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3108.6600000000003s)]
*  Whether you're a member or a staffer, whatever. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3109.82s)]
*  It's a dirty mentality. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3112.6600000000003s)]
*  And I'm from New York. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3114.3s)]
*  I have a high threshold for dirty and sleazy, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3115.98s)]
*  but even for me, that kind of went like a notch above. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3119.98s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't comprehend this. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  This is a government building. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3128.46s)]
*  We're supposed to be boring. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3130.1400000000003s)]
*  Sex was never in the job description. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3132.2200000000003s)]
*  Especially like sadomasochistic tinged sex. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3134.94s)]
*  Like it's about- [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3138.34s)]
*  We all saw the Senate twink, right? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3139.1800000000003s)]
*  Oh yeah, the guy having sex in the committee room. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3141.9s)]
*  In the confirmation room of all [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3144.26s)]
*  with Amy Klobuchar's chair. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3146.1s)]
*  So tragic. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3148.3s)]
*  What was the response to that? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3150.86s)]
*  I was already out at that point. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3152.98s)]
*  Were you shocked? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3155.6600000000003s)]
*  I was not just shocked. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3157.66s)]
*  I'm gay. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3159.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't wanna be associated to that. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3160.9s)]
*  I've fought too hard to disassociate [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3162.66s)]
*  from the Game, Inc. and LGBT mafia. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3166.1s)]
*  This whole nonsense yesterday in New York City [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3169.38s)]
*  with the gay parade. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3171.58s)]
*  None of that represents me and my partner. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3173.54s)]
*  We don't walk around in thongs, in dog masks, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3175.94s)]
*  on all fours. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3178.62s)]
*  None of that represents us. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3182.82s)]
*  We don't walk around naked. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3184.38s)]
*  But what are you achieving with that? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3185.98s)]
*  And then this kid goes in there and does this. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3187.86s)]
*  What are you trying to achieve? [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3189.94s)]
*  Marginalize people who have fought like hell? [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3191.54s)]
*  Cause if you go back to Stonewall, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3195.38s)]
*  Stonewall was about rights, not about promiscuous city. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3197.22s)]
*  So what are these people trying to achieve? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3201.5s)]
*  Creating hatred towards us. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3204.58s)]
*  That has to be it. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3206.1s)]
*  They're marginalizing us with these acts. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3207.22s)]
*  So a person like that twink, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3209.3s)]
*  that kid from the Senate confirmation room, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3210.82s)]
*  I loathe a human being like that. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3212.94s)]
*  Because I instantly get bundled into a basket, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3214.54s)]
*  to quote Hillary Clinton, of deplorable. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3219.2599999999998s)]
*  And I'm not that. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3221.2599999999998s)]
*  You know? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3223.46s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3224.3s)]
*  I mean, it does seem like a way to establish dominance [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3225.14s)]
*  or something like I get to have sex in the confirmation room. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3229.9s)]
*  Like there's nothing you can do about it. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3233.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3235.22s)]
*  There's a hostility. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3236.06s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3237.54s)]
*  He was fired, but no charges. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3238.38s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3240.42s)]
*  Are members of Congress sleeping with each other? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3242.02s)]
*  There's a few, but consensual. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3245.26s)]
*  Yeah, why are you saying consensual? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3247.34s)]
*  Consensual adults who are out of their relationships [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3249.1s)]
*  at this point. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3253.5s)]
*  Can you tell who the freaks are? [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3254.34s)]
*  The freaks in Congress? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3255.9s)]
*  I can't, you know what? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3258.02s)]
*  I'll say this to you. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3259.1800000000003s)]
*  The freakiest member in Congress [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3260.02s)]
*  is a very good friend of mine. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3261.58s)]
*  Oh, she is? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3263.2200000000003s)]
*  He is. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3264.62s)]
*  He is? [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3265.46s)]
*  But I would not, I don't want to go down this path. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3267.34s)]
*  Let's just- [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3269.78s)]
*  No, no, I won't. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3270.62s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you about Nancy Mace. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3271.44s)]
*  What is Nancy Mace like? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3272.28s)]
*  So Nancy and I used- [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3274.86s)]
*  What is that? [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3276.22s)]
*  What is the Nancy Mace thing? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3277.1s)]
*  I don't know Nancy Mace. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3278.38s)]
*  We used to get along in 2020. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3280.02s)]
*  And then she was the first one to, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3284.98s)]
*  the moment anything goes sideways, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3286.7400000000002s)]
*  that's when you see people who were really your friends, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3288.46s)]
*  she decided to go totally sideways on me [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3291.06s)]
*  and use me as a punching line and all that. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3293.14s)]
*  But didn't vote to expel me. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3295.22s)]
*  Didn't vote to expel me, and I respect her for that. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3296.9s)]
*  But Nancy is just, I mean, I can't explain it. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3299.74s)]
*  According- [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3307.8599999999997s)]
*  She seems very unhappy. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3308.7s)]
*  There is a kind of exhibitionism, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3309.9399999999996s)]
*  but it's not just exhibitionism. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3312.18s)]
*  There's something really sad. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3313.4199999999996s)]
*  She doesn't need to show herself naked. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3314.7s)]
*  Her tits do it for her. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3316.06s)]
*  They're massive. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3317.58s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3318.4199999999996s)]
*  Her tits show up before she does. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3320.46s)]
*  If she's turning a door, you'll see her boobs first, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3322.66s)]
*  and you're like, oh, that's Mace. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3325.74s)]
*  Are they famous in Congress? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3328.2599999999998s)]
*  They're pretty well known all around the country [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3330.5s)]
*  at this point. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3332.18s)]
*  Have you not seen the videos? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3333.02s)]
*  And again, not shaming, not body shaming. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3334.42s)]
*  I think if she's happy with that, that's for her. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3336.8599999999997s)]
*  But I'm just trying to say, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3339.22s)]
*  you don't need to show yourself naked [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3340.42s)]
*  to get the attention. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3342.2999999999997s)]
*  Just put a nice little cleavage like you usually do, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3343.5s)]
*  and it works well. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3345.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, like if it's attention to her currency, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3346.98s)]
*  that's a fact. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3349.46s)]
*  Her staff will tell you that. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3351.14s)]
*  If you speak to a former staff of hers, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3352.3399999999997s)]
*  your mind will blow. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3353.8599999999997s)]
*  What are they saying? [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3355.06s)]
*  She's an attention whore, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3355.9s)]
*  self-angrindizement maniac. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3357.34s)]
*  That's all they say. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3359.7000000000003s)]
*  Every last one of her former staffers will say that. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3363.1400000000003s)]
*  Every last one. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3366.2200000000003s)]
*  Even by the standards of Congress. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3367.0600000000004s)]
*  That's the scary part. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3369.34s)]
*  They say that it goes beyond, [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3371.02s)]
*  and these are people who've worked for other people. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3372.82s)]
*  Remember, we're all megalomaniacs. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3374.6200000000003s)]
*  But for her to stand out, it's a very special situation. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3378.3s)]

*  That's not up for question. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3384.1000000000004s)]
*  And if anyone tells you they're not, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3385.54s)]
*  then they shouldn't be putting their name on a ballot [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3388.26s)]
*  because it takes a special kind of megalomania [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3389.1000000000004s)]
*  to say, pick me, I'm the best for you. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3391.7400000000002s)]
*  No, I totally agree. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3395.5800000000004s)]
*  I could never do that. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3397.78s)]
*  Although I think you'll be president one day. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3399.5s)]
*  I don't think I'm the best. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3401.26s)]
*  But nobody is the best. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3402.6200000000003s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3404.7400000000002s)]
*  But I think you will be. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3406.5s)]
*  I just want to be super clear [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3409.6600000000003s)]
*  because I know Nancy Mace will see this, [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3411.1000000000004s)]
*  and I have nothing against Nancy Mace, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3413.0600000000004s)]
*  and I'm not attacking her at all. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3414.38s)]
*  I just feel a sad, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3416.54s)]
*  that seems like a super unhappy person [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3418.62s)]
*  who should pause, address whatever is making her [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3421.38s)]
*  show naked pictures of herself, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3425.66s)]
*  or talk about sexual assault, or alleged sexual assault, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3426.98s)]
*  or all that kind of behavior. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3430.18s)]
*  I'm like, you should not be in a leadership position. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3431.34s)]
*  Okay, number one, you are not settled inside. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3434.14s)]
*  She needs to take care of herself. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3436.42s)]
*  You shouldn't be in charge of other people. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3438.1s)]
*  Are you joking? [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3439.98s)]
*  How can you have a system that elevates [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3441.02s)]
*  like obviously crazy unhappy people [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3444.1s)]
*  to positions of authority? [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3445.94s)]
*  That's not a working system. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3446.94s)]
*  It explains her turnover. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3448.5s)]
*  Oh, is it high? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3450.2999999999997s)]
*  It's the worst. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3451.14s)]
*  By metrics, it's the worst turnover [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3452.94s)]
*  among staff in Congress. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3457.18s)]
*  Of all Congress people, she has the worst turnover. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3459.58s)]
*  Yeah, that poor woman. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3462.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I hope whatever she needs, she gets. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3463.66s)]
*  I don't hold an ounce of animosity to it. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3466.18s)]
*  Right, no, it doesn't feel like you. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3468.98s)]
*  I say this jokingly because it's funny. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3470.2599999999998s)]
*  And I will not miss a joke if I could make it. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3473.1s)]
*  So it's not to degrade or demean or shame her, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3475.7799999999997s)]
*  but she's definitely traumatized. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3478.4199999999996s)]
*  And maybe there's a lot of truth to what this [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3480.5s)]
*  alleged criminal ex-boyfriend did to her. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3483.2599999999998s)]
*  And it really hurt this woman [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3486.14s)]
*  because she's not the same woman I met in 2020. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3487.4199999999996s)]
*  But she don't get to lead my country. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3489.7s)]
*  I feel like we should be led by sober, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3492.58s)]
*  responsible people who think longitudinally, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3494.46s)]
*  who have squared away personal lives [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3498.18s)]
*  and people who love them, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3499.98s)]
*  people to whom they're accountable, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3500.9s)]
*  grandchildren, like normal people, property owners, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3502.26s)]
*  people who are vested in the country, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3504.94s)]
*  not people who are acting out their self-actualization [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3506.54s)]
*  or whatever on stage. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3510.38s)]
*  Keyword, sober. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3511.86s)]
*  Sober. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3513.1s)]
*  Oh, is there a lot of partying up there? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3513.94s)]
*  Oh yeah, I mean, the sheer volume of alcohol [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3515.7000000000003s)]
*  in Congress is staggering. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3522.46s)]
*  I know, and some of them have been caught by alcoholics. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3525.14s)]
*  A lot of them, and some of them are great. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3528.26s)]
*  Great people. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3530.98s)]
*  And alcoholism is a disease that I, it's very sad. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3531.82s)]
*  In there. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3535.54s)]
*  So I get it, no I get it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3536.38s)]
*  Look, I will say this. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3537.62s)]
*  I like, I drink, I'm not an alcoholic per se. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3540.26s)]
*  Per se. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3544.3s)]
*  Or by the standards of Congress, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3546.1s)]
*  I could never be an alcoholic [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3547.46s)]
*  because I can't drink half a bottle of scotch [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3548.94s)]
*  in one sitting or three bottles of wine [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3551.46s)]
*  like I've seen some of these guys crush it. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3554.14s)]
*  I'm like two glasses in and I'm just like. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3556.46s)]
*  Guys in leadership too. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3558.98s)]
*  Dude, it's. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3561.94s)]
*  No, I know them. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3564.0600000000004s)]
*  I heard from one the other night who I like so much. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3565.1000000000004s)]
*  Nice man, he's texting me late night [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3568.0600000000004s)]
*  about something totally bizarre. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3570.98s)]
*  Not bad, and not creepy or anything, [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3572.6200000000003s)]
*  but just it was clear he was drunk. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3574.3s)]
*  But you know it's a bottle text to you. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3575.46s)]
*  Loaded, loaded, sentimental, stuff like that. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3577.02s)]
*  And I'm like, oh. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3579.42s)]
*  So you noticed that a lot. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3580.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, I smelled it a lot. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3582.5s)]
*  Actually? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3584.46s)]
*  Yeah, it was so bad. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3585.3s)]
*  Everything is a party, right? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3587.46s)]
*  So think of all those late nights voting, right? [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3589.26s)]
*  Some members, Tucker, would show up so wasted. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3594.26s)]
*  They would have to sit in the cloakroom [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3600.26s)]
*  and hand their voting cards to sober members [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3602.9s)]
*  to go do their job. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3605.7400000000002s)]
*  Actually? [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3607.46s)]
*  Yeah, and that's actually against House rules. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3608.3s)]
*  I've seen that in my cloakroom. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3610.34s)]
*  I know it happens in the Democrat cloakroom [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3613.1s)]
*  because I've exchanged notes with a fellow freshman. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3615.18s)]
*  He's like, ah, it happens here too. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3617.58s)]
*  It's a shit show. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3618.94s)]
*  So yeah, I've watched groups of some of my colleagues, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  some guys who I genuinely like a lot, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3624.2999999999997s)]
*  sit in the corner of the cloakroom, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3626.66s)]
*  completely inebriated, incapable of walking outside, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3628.58s)]
*  standing still, sticking their card [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3634.1s)]
*  and pressing yay or nay and back. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3635.98s)]
*  Especially when we had long amendment battles [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3638.58s)]
*  with like 70 amendments. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3640.98s)]
*  They just hand their cards and say, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3643.3s)]
*  just vote whichever way you're gonna vote. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3645.34s)]
*  I mean, it's the only thing I, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3647.1800000000003s)]
*  just don't make me look crazy. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3649.42s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3651.9s)]
*  I've personally seen it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3653.54s)]
*  So, and nobody's ever probably gonna have the cojones [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3654.86s)]
*  to come here and tell you this. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3658.26s)]
*  I mean, clearly no one has respect [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3659.7400000000002s)]
*  for the institution, obviously. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3661.1000000000004s)]
*  Zero, zero. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3662.3s)]
*  I mean, members leave DC to go back home sometimes [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3663.94s)]
*  under like the hush hush, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3669.1000000000004s)]
*  but they're still voting [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3671.06s)]
*  because someone else is voting for them. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3672.66s)]
*  That's criminal. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3674.2999999999997s)]
*  That actually happens? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3676.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that happens. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3677.2999999999997s)]
*  I've seen it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3678.74s)]
*  Well, that's illegal. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3679.7s)]
*  Well, that's what I said, it's criminal. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3680.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3683.66s)]
*  You know, it's not hard to pull up flight logs [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3684.98s)]
*  and do like a tabulation of like, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3687.66s)]
*  wait, how could you be in two places at the same time? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3689.22s)]
*  The FAA keeps strict flight logs. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3692.42s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3694.7s)]
*  It's not very hard to prove that what I'm saying is fact. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3696.5s)]
*  It's just do an investigation and you'll see. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3699.98s)]
*  Why don't congressional reporters [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3703.06s)]
*  ever write any of this stuff? [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3705.5s)]
*  It's hard to note to their defense. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3706.78s)]
*  It's hard to know if a member is there or not. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3709.9s)]
*  It's imagine 435 people from a bird's eye view [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3711.78s)]
*  when you're in the gallery, they look like ants, right? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3718.82s)]
*  They're like scrambling. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3721.46s)]
*  And wait, I didn't stay still. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3722.42s)]
*  I would go from one end to the other. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3723.58s)]
*  It's impossible to keep track. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3725.3s)]
*  The way they keep track is, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3727.2200000000003s)]
*  oh, they must be here, they voted. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3728.94s)]
*  Do you know how many times I would go in through under, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3730.02s)]
*  so the dais is here and you have the reporters [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3733.9s)]
*  on top of it in the gallery. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3736.82s)]
*  Sometimes I would come right underneath there. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3738.62s)]
*  There's a little slip there to vote. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3740.46s)]
*  They wouldn't see me because I didn't go to fly. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3742.38s)]
*  I'd vote because I was giving an interview out [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3744.3s)]
*  or I was on a phone call and you can't talk in the chamber. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3746.1s)]
*  So I'd put it in my pocket, go in there, look up, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3748.9s)]
*  oh, this is a vote, vote, go back out there, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3751.06s)]
*  continue my phone call. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3752.78s)]
*  They would never see me, but they're seeing my vote go up. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3754.02s)]
*  So they're like, oh, he's here somewhere. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3756.5s)]
*  That's why they get away with it. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3758.86s)]
*  It's very- [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3760.86s)]
*  What about all the others? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3761.7s)]
*  I mean, just the general vibe of it, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3762.54s)]
*  I don't live there, I don't know a hundredth of what you know, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3764.38s)]
*  but just from dealing with members of Congress a lot [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3768.42s)]
*  by text or on the phone, it seems kind of out of control. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3770.98s)]
*  It is. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3774.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, it feels that way. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3775.58s)]
*  It's a frat house gone rogue. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3776.42s)]
*  It feels that way and not in a fun way either. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3777.26s)]
*  At her expense. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3780.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3782.7400000000002s)]
*  At our expense. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3783.58s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3784.4s)]
*  That's the problem. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3785.2400000000002s)]
*  When was the last time Politico wrote that piece? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3786.08s)]
*  Like the reporters don't really seem to write about this. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3789.04s)]
*  I don't think there's an appetite [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3791.36s)]
*  because there's a currency of access in DC [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3793.2s)]
*  that reporters are a pigeon hole to. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3796.2799999999997s)]
*  And ethics has gone out the window for reporters in large, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3798.7999999999997s)]
*  because if they actually do the hard bangers, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3802.94s)]
*  the ones that are in DC do the hard bangers, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3806.0s)]
*  you lose access. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3808.68s)]
*  The outlets don't want that. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3809.96s)]
*  So there's an outsourcing that happens, right? [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3810.96s)]
*  So they'll get a whiff of something, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3814.6s)]
*  give it to their editors and say, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3816.8399999999997s)]
*  I can't write this, but find someone. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3818.0s)]
*  But then when you're outsourcing it [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3820.08s)]
*  and the person isn't there and doesn't have access, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3821.68s)]
*  the story doesn't get written without confirmation. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3824.16s)]
*  You can't get a second and a third to confirm. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3827.16s)]
*  It's tough for them to write it. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3829.68s)]
*  It is tough. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3831.04s)]
*  So there's an ethics issue that's going on in Congress [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3831.88s)]
*  and reporting for a while now. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3835.46s)]
*  I believe that the answer to the question I asked [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3839.36s)]
*  at the outset, which is why did they decide to destroy you? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3842.44s)]
*  Not that you did nothing wrong, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3847.1600000000003s)]
*  but your sins compared to the sins of your colleagues [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3848.2400000000002s)]
*  didn't really stand out in my opinion at all. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3851.36s)]
*  I was a great volleyball player. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3854.6800000000003s)]
*  So that's it. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3856.28s)]
*  So I just want to ask you about that. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3858.56s)]
*  So the reason I want to interview those [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3859.7200000000003s)]
*  before I got fired from Fox [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3861.32s)]
*  and I never got to the interview, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3862.7200000000003s)]
*  but I just wanted to tell you, [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3863.96s)]
*  I thought that was the funniest thing I'd ever heard. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3865.92s)]
*  That was like Dada, that was like performance art. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3867.92s)]
*  That was just incredible. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3870.06s)]
*  The volleyball team at Baruch, that's like, [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3873.1200000000003s)]
*  I wish I'd thought of that. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3875.4s)]
*  I'm sorry, I know I will be attacked for being nihilistic [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3876.44s)]
*  or making fun of serious things, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3879.52s)]
*  but I did think that was funny. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3880.88s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3881.92s)]
*  But I think you may have infuriated people [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3883.06s)]
*  by mocking the system itself. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3887.42s)]
*  This is my kind of pet theory. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3890.1600000000003s)]
*  I know it's kind of- [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3891.48s)]
*  Oh no, it's my theory. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3892.6s)]
*  Oh, is it? [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3894.2200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so tell me. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3895.06s)]
*  So the volleyball story, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3895.88s)]
*  a lot of people don't understand. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3897.96s)]
*  So what is the volleyball story? [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3898.8s)]
*  Tell us the volleyball story. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3899.84s)]
*  I had a GOP chairman in the district, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3900.66s)]
*  Joe Cairo, who's a sports fanatic. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3903.3399999999997s)]
*  Notre Dame grad, still live, he's like 80, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3905.2599999999998s)]
*  and he still lives in the dawn of Notre Dame. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3908.2999999999997s)]
*  He used to, what do you whistle? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3911.1s)]
*  Like referee, I guess, games until he got injured [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3913.42s)]
*  so he couldn't, but he still goes to the games. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3915.74s)]
*  Very big football fan. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3917.74s)]
*  Every second word out of his mouth is a sports analogy. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3920.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't like football. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3924.3799999999997s)]
*  I go to watch baseball, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3926.1s)]
*  but I don't understand the plays too much, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3928.78s)]
*  but I enjoy the sport. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3930.78s)]
*  It's all American, right? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3932.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3933.6200000000003s)]
*  I know everything about volleyball, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3935.1400000000003s)]
*  but I've never really played [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3937.0600000000004s)]
*  because I never really went to college. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3938.2200000000003s)]
*  So I said, I'm just going to make up [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3939.86s)]
*  I went to college, played volleyball, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3941.38s)]
*  and I can have some sports analogies and he'll like me. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3943.82s)]
*  And it worked. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3946.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3947.5400000000004s)]
*  It was supposed to be a little white lie [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3949.98s)]
*  just to create proximity with one guy, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3952.02s)]
*  but then he started talking about how I was a volleyball star. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3954.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm like, fuck, this went completely. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3958.02s)]
*  And then I literally started Googling, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3961.98s)]
*  like, oh, Baruch played Harvard. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3964.2599999999998s)]
*  They beat them. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3966.86s)]
*  I'm like, that's all I can think of. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3967.7s)]
*  Sadly, it's the truth. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3971.02s)]
*  I fucked up. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3972.9s)]
*  There's no such thing as a white lie, Tucker. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3975.38s)]
*  I think that's true. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3977.58s)]
*  There's no such thing. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3978.42s)]
*  There's no white little lie, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3979.38s)]
*  just so you don't hurt, feel, no, no, no. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3980.86s)]
*  The truth is imperative because I am, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3982.82s)]
*  I went from being known by my friends [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3985.7s)]
*  as being a blunt asshole [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3988.58s)]
*  to becoming liar, liar, pants on fire. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3989.4199999999996s)]
*  And it's so shocking. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3993.66s)]
*  Some of my friends tell me that. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3994.9399999999996s)]
*  They're like, George, how do you go from being the guy [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3996.3799999999997s)]
*  who would eviscerate people to their face [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=3998.4599999999996s)]
*  to now being called a liar? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4000.54s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4001.8199999999997s)]
*  You think the brood volleyball? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4004.62s)]
*  My favorite was you had said, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4007.3799999999997s)]
*  or you were perceived to have said, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4009.3799999999997s)]
*  I don't have no idea what you actually said, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4011.22s)]
*  but people would say he pretended to work at Goldman Sachs [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4012.5s)]
*  and he didn't, as if working at Goldman Sachs [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4016.54s)]
*  was something to be proud of. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4019.38s)]
*  So that was another thing. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4021.66s)]
*  That's hilarious to me. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4023.42s)]
*  They're mad that you didn't work at Goldman Sachs? [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4024.9s)]
*  Like what? [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4027.18s)]
*  That's where Tulsi actually really got me. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4028.02s)]
*  Oh, she did. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4030.06s)]
*  And I tried to explain and then I said, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4030.9s)]
*  it's just gonna go over everybody's head. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4032.46s)]
*  I worked for a company and we contracted work with them. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4033.7s)]
*  For the sake of embellishing [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4037.7799999999997s)]
*  and everybody embellishes their resume, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4040.3s)]
*  that's an actual fact. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4042.14s)]
*  I'm not saying you should, [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4043.18s)]
*  but everybody likes to make them feel [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4044.66s)]
*  a little bit more important, so I put it on there. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4046.1s)]
*  Oh my God, that was so bad. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4049.14s)]
*  Oh, big mistake. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4050.74s)]
*  Never embellish. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4051.54s)]
*  For me, never embellish. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4052.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm so grateful you didn't work at Goldman Sachs. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4053.94s)]
*  In fact, you should get a tattoo [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4056.22s)]
*  that says I did not work at Goldman Sachs [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4057.2999999999997s)]
*  just to brag about it. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4059.14s)]
*  Or Citigroup. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4059.98s)]
*  Citigroup, can you imagine? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4060.9s)]
*  Can you imagine anything more shameful? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4064.54s)]
*  It's today, actually, I'm embarrassed to ever had said that. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4066.38s)]
*  Thinking to myself today, I'm like, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4071.98s)]
*  of all things to lie or to embellish, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4074.38s)]
*  why would I embellish this? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4076.9s)]
*  No, because if you were like an OnlyFans performer [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4077.7400000000002s)]
*  or just like a straight walker, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4080.1400000000003s)]
*  you could at least say like, I ran out of money, whatever. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4082.02s)]
*  If you work at Citibank or Goldman, [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4084.5s)]
*  it's hard to explain. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4086.82s)]
*  I wouldn't want one of my children to come home [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4088.02s)]
*  and say I took a job at Goldman. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4089.58s)]
*  I would be really upset. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4091.3s)]
*  No, I don't blame you. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4093.26s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4094.26s)]
*  No, no, I don't blame you. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4095.1000000000004s)]
*  It's like working for BlackRock and Blackstone. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4095.94s)]
*  It's these mega corporations [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4098.06s)]
*  are part of the problems we have today. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4100.7s)]
*  I completely agree. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4102.06s)]
*  You think that making a mockery [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4103.18s)]
*  of what the rest of them pretend to hold sacred [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4108.02s)]
*  is what made them hate you? [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4111.5s)]
*  I exposed the theater. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4113.900000000001s)]
*  And you know it's funny, and I say this because, [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4118.58s)]
*  do you know when you look up to someone really well, [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4123.26s)]
*  like, and you're like, this is a standup guy. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4125.42s)]
*  This is somebody I admire. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4128.900000000001s)]
*  And for me, that was Ryan Zinke. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4130.820000000001s)]
*  Always thought he was such a stellar statesman. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4132.9s)]
*  It's the hat thing going on. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4136.7s)]
*  I think it's cool. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4138.259999999999s)]
*  Former SEAL. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4139.339999999999s)]
*  Former SEAL, Secretary of the Interior, [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4140.78s)]
*  Congressman, just a good man. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4142.86s)]
*  Do you know what's the first things he said to me [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4145.9s)]
*  on the house floor once? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4147.78s)]
*  He said, George, I'm gonna talk to you. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4148.62s)]
*  I know you're going through some stuff, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4150.179999999999s)]
*  but just remember this. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4151.86s)]
*  This is all theater. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4153.219999999999s)]
*  All that matters is you have one of the best seats [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4154.46s)]
*  in the house. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4156.46s)]
*  I completely lost respect for him. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4159.58s)]
*  Talk about never meet your heroes. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4162.1s)]
*  Yeah, no, I know. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4163.9800000000005s)]
*  I sat there like, oh, okay. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4165.900000000001s)]
*  I left so defeated that day. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4169.26s)]
*  I remember going back to the office. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4171.26s)]
*  I looked at my chief. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4172.860000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I don't understand this place. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4173.700000000001s)]
*  He's like, what happened? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4177.14s)]
*  I said, this, this, this happened. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4178.58s)]
*  He's like, oh, but he's just trying to be funny. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4180.34s)]
*  I'm like, I didn't think it was funny. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4182.5s)]
*  I'm not laughing at jokes. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4186.18s)]
*  And that's when I started to realize it's all theater [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4188.86s)]
*  and I expose the theater. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4191.54s)]
*  But I mean, how long can this continue? [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4192.78s)]
*  Does anyone there think like, okay, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4195.58s)]
*  Congress doesn't actually make meaningful decisions. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4197.78s)]
*  They passed all their power to the president, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4200.74s)]
*  the executive, to the agencies, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4202.58s)]
*  all the power of regulation, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4204.66s)]
*  all the real power exists outside of Congress. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4205.74s)]
*  They have only budgetary power, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4207.82s)]
*  which they don't really exercise. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4209.34s)]
*  They don't leverage. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4211.299999999999s)]
*  They're a joke and they're having sex in the basement. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4212.139999999999s)]
*  Like, how long does this go on? [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4214.94s)]
*  I don't think, if Congress, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4217.82s)]
*  I hate using this as an example [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4221.3s)]
*  because it can be viewed as a terrible way. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4222.94s)]
*  But did you ever watch a show, [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4225.7s)]
*  Designated Survivor with Keith or Sutherland? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4226.78s)]
*  No. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4228.94s)]
*  Essentially a terrorist attack happens [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4229.86s)]
*  and a conspiracy happens in the country [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4231.82s)]
*  and the whole, during the state of the union, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4234.38s)]
*  the Capitol's blown up. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4236.38s)]
*  All governments wiped out. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4238.42s)]
*  The only person left is a designated survivor, [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4239.86s)]
*  which is the secretary of, I think, HUD. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4241.98s)]
*  HUD. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4244.94s)]
*  And he becomes president of the United States, right? [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4245.78s)]
*  And it's Keith or Sutherland. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4248.98s)]
*  So we all get crappy housing. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4250.0599999999995s)]
*  We all move into state. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4251.219999999999s)]
*  Well, what that show shows, [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4252.58s)]
*  I'm not advocating for that, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4254.78s)]
*  but what that show kind of shows you is, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4256.34s)]
*  Congress was so broken [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4259.82s)]
*  that when they have the clean slate, [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4261.3s)]
*  they bring this whole, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4263.7s)]
*  I got goosebumps talking about this, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4264.78s)]
*  but I think what we generally need is a shakeup. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4266.099999999999s)]
*  We need to clean house Republican, Democrat, everyone. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4270.7s)]
*  It's bad enough we have senators like Chuck Grassley, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4276.74s)]
*  who are like four generations removed [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4279.0599999999995s)]
*  from the actual bulk of the workforce in America today, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4281.099999999999s)]
*  who's what, under 40, under 45. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4285.78s)]
*  Chuck Grassley's almost 90 [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4288.3s)]
*  and he's talking about potentially running for reelection. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4289.7s)]
*  I don't know that he'll do that, but understand that. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4292.58s)]
*  And I love Chuck Grassley. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4295.099999999999s)]
*  Me too. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4296.58s)]
*  Tons of sacrifices. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4297.42s)]
*  But we need to learn how to let go. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4299.099999999999s)]
*  We can't all Dianne Feinstein it. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4302.0599999999995s)]
*  And may she rest in peace. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4304.26s)]
*  She was a trailblazer in her own right. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4307.820000000001s)]
*  I disagree with her, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4310.9400000000005s)]
*  but she was a strong woman, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4312.22s)]
*  went to Congress, became a senator, whatever. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4313.58s)]
*  I disagree with her policies, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4315.900000000001s)]
*  but she served her country [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4317.1s)]
*  in the best way she thought she did. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4318.3s)]
*  But why are we letting these people die in office? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4320.02s)]
*  In such, it's like watching Joe Biden. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4323.02s)]
*  It was elder abuse. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4326.14s)]
*  The whole presidency was elder abuse. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4327.740000000001s)]
*  Why are we doing this to our country? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4330.18s)]
*  At what cost is this coming? [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4331.820000000001s)]
*  So I think we need a reset, a great American reset. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4334.54s)]
*  And that means everybody needs [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4337.7s)]
*  to just not run for reelection. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4339.459999999999s)]
*  I don't care if you're a freshman today. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4341.0199999999995s)]
*  We just need a real reset. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4342.74s)]
*  I try to convince them to pass a bill [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4345.339999999999s)]
*  that would say every Congress, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4348.98s)]
*  if that Congress fails, and it's not my bill, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4351.86s)]
*  but if that Congress fails to balance the budget, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4354.379999999999s)]
*  which is its sole duty and obligation, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4356.379999999999s)]
*  every member therefore would be ineligible for reelection. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4358.7s)]
*  I was laughed at by every single person I proposed this to. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4363.02s)]
*  I bet you were. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4365.700000000001s)]
*  I was laughed at. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4367.1s)]
*  I mean, we were promised term limits, which I support. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4368.540000000001s)]
*  I have some issues with it, [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4371.820000000001s)]
*  because the moment you pass term limits, [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4373.14s)]
*  you're handicapping the choice of the people [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4375.860000000001s)]
*  and deferring the power to staff, which is dangerous. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4379.9800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4382.620000000001s)]
*  It's a very dangerous move. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4383.46s)]
*  So there needs to be provisions in term limits [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4384.38s)]
*  that also move on to staff [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4386.780000000001s)]
*  and what capacity they can serve for how long, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4389.18s)]
*  because we already have an issue. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4391.660000000001s)]
*  I have a problem with staff in DC, which is what? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4393.86s)]
*  Lobbyists, wine and dine committee directors [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4396.74s)]
*  more often than they do members. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4399.82s)]
*  Do you know why? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4401.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4402.54s)]
*  They slip in the pork. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4403.379999999999s)]
*  Because they make the decisions. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4404.54s)]
*  And nobody knows. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4405.379999999999s)]
*  Members aren't reading bills, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4406.78s)]
*  unless you're Thomas Massie and Chip Roy. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4408.219999999999s)]
*  Nobody's reading bills. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4409.78s)]
*  They don't read them. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4411.62s)]
*  No, I did. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4413.58s)]
*  Do you know why? [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4414.419999999999s)]
*  I had no committees. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4415.259999999999s)]
*  I was bored. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4416.099999999999s)]
*  Why did you have no committees? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4416.94s)]
*  I stepped down from committee assignments [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4419.820000000001s)]
*  because I genuinely believed [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4421.860000000001s)]
*  it would really hurt the work of the committee. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4424.02s)]
*  Tucker, I had a tale of 60 reporters at days harassing. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4427.5s)]
*  So you, and pardon my aging memory, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4432.02s)]
*  you were under, so you get elected in 22? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4436.3s)]
*  Yep. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4441.3s)]
*  You come in January 23 and you're out by December 23. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4442.38s)]
*  So that means- [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4447.620000000001s)]
*  11 months. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4448.62s)]
*  11 months. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4449.46s)]
*  And you got there and you were already [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4450.3s)]
*  in the middle of the swarm. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4452.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4453.38s)]
*  I had been already 10 days [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4454.46s)]
*  since the New York Times story broke. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4456.38s)]
*  Wow. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4458.1s)]
*  So when I showed up, you don't understand, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4459.22s)]
*  there's a video of me. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4461.78s)]
*  I looked like Dora the Explorer. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4463.9800000000005s)]
*  I had a book bag. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4465.18s)]
*  I like wearing book bags, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4466.02s)]
*  but this particular one was from my 2020 election [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4467.22s)]
*  that I almost got elected in. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4469.9800000000005s)]
*  The absentee ballots reversed the long story. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4472.26s)]
*  So it was the House GOP conference one. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4475.7s)]
*  And I said, on my first day this time around, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4478.78s)]
*  I'm gonna wear that dumb bag. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4480.94s)]
*  So I had the book bag on my back, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4483.099999999999s)]
*  like literally like first day at school, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4484.9s)]
*  kind of like vibe, had my staff with me [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4487.66s)]
*  and we're walking to my office when we turn the corner, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4490.139999999999s)]
*  at least 50 reporters, cameras. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4492.98s)]
*  I forgot what they're called, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4497.66s)]
*  those bigger cameras that do live feeds. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4498.58s)]
*  I mean, you wouldn't believe it. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4501.0599999999995s)]
*  We couldn't open our door without tripping over reporters. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4503.3s)]
*  And this was from the very first day. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4506.34s)]
*  January 3rd. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4508.1s)]
*  Damn. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4509.900000000001s)]
*  And then if you go back to the speaker's vote [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4510.900000000001s)]
*  as we're going through all those rounds, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4514.66s)]
*  you would think that I was the main subject of the vote [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4518.14s)]
*  because C-SPAN cameras, if I moved all the cameras, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4521.46s)]
*  I remember joking, Matt Gaetz is like, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4525.860000000001s)]
*  George Santos moved. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4529.02s)]
*  You know where he's sitting [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4531.54s)]
*  because the cameras are pointing in that direction. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4532.62s)]
*  I don't know if it was matter for his large, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4535.379999999999s)]
*  somebody said that. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4536.86s)]
*  I actually, I don't think it was Matt. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4537.7s)]
*  I think it was someone else who said it. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4538.78s)]
*  But it was like the cameras kept moving [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4540.139999999999s)]
*  in whichever which direction I went. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4543.46s)]
*  Like if you go back to the coverage of the speaker's vote, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4545.98s)]
*  it's like me plastered everywhere [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4548.9s)]
*  in a very uncomfortable way. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4551.62s)]
*  Like I was scratching my nose [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4553.82s)]
*  and people said I was picking my nose. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4555.259999999999s)]
*  I'm like, I'm scratching my nose. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4556.5s)]
*  Do you think there's anything [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4558.78s)]
*  a Democratic member of Congress could do to get expelled? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4560.34s)]
*  Do you think a hundred Republicans would vote [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4563.9s)]
*  for the expulsion of a Democrat for anything? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4565.94s)]
*  I mean, you assault somebody and they're still there. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4568.54s)]
*  Look, I reject the notion of expulsion. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4570.74s)]
*  I agree. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4573.5s)]
*  I wrote a piece recently [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4574.34s)]
*  and I ran it on the South Shore Press [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4576.5s)]
*  on the case of LaMonica McIverson. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4578.219999999999s)]
*  I reject any notion of expelling her. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4580.78s)]
*  I think she needs to be afforded due process. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4583.66s)]
*  Just because- Obviously. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4585.54s)]
*  Just because you set bad precedent with me [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4586.66s)]
*  doesn't mean one size fits all. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4588.38s)]
*  And that gets people a little like off guard when I say that [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4589.5s)]
*  because they would think I want to see everybody expelled. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4592.3s)]
*  No, I believe in the Constitution. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4595.1s)]
*  I believe in due process. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4596.42s)]
*  100%. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4597.7s)]
*  She needs to have due process. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4598.54s)]
*  The people rule. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4600.1s)]
*  They'll decide who serves them. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4601.26s)]
*  She acted like a thug. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4602.54s)]
*  Don't get me wrong. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4603.54s)]
*  Outside that ICE facility. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4604.38s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4605.58s)]
*  But she has due process. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4606.66s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4609.1s)]
*  And Alina Habba's delivering it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4609.9400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4611.18s)]
*  So in the end, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4613.02s)]
*  the DOJ was just tough on you, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4617.02s)]
*  the Democrat controlled DOJ [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4620.02s)]
*  as some of your Republican colleagues. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4621.860000000001s)]
*  I mean Merrick Garland [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4624.860000000001s)]
*  supervises case directly. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4627.740000000001s)]
*  Directly? [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4630.22s)]
*  Directly. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4631.06s)]
*  I mean, my attorneys were talking to the DOJ attorneys [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4631.900000000001s)]
*  and they say, okay, we got to go back to the AG [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4634.42s)]
*  and see if this works. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4636.1s)]
*  Damn. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4637.42s)]
*  So that's a lot. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4638.38s)]
*  It's a lot of pressure. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4639.620000000001s)]
*  Now I understand probably why. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4640.94s)]
*  I'm a city member of Congress. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4642.74s)]
*  So that kind of checks. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4644.14s)]
*  But you would think that that would be more hands off [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4646.42s)]
*  once I was expelled. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4648.38s)]
*  It continued the same. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4649.5s)]
*  Everything was run through the AG. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4650.62s)]
*  They had zero agency. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4652.22s)]
*  The one thing that brings cause for pause [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4654.14s)]
*  is the amount of discrepancies [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4657.54s)]
*  throughout this entire process I had. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4659.46s)]
*  Exculpatory evidence being withheld for 14 months. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4662.42s)]
*  Significant, not just nominal, [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4665.1s)]
*  significant exculpatory evidence [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4666.78s)]
*  being withheld for 14 months. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4668.94s)]
*  Motions ignoring Supreme Court rulings. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4670.98s)]
*  I mean, it's a laundry list. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4673.54s)]
*  I'm being forced, Tucker, to pay back $200 and somewhat, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4677.66s)]
*  $200 and somewhat odd thousand dollars back to the NRCC. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4682.74s)]
*  Money that I've never seen. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4687.0599999999995s)]
*  It was used towards my campaign. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4688.78s)]
*  And the NRCC in its own admission says [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4691.179999999999s)]
*  they would have spent the money. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4693.9s)]
*  That's the bare minimum they spend anyway, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4694.98s)]
*  because my polling numbers were good. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4697.5s)]
*  The DOJ says they only spend it under false pretenses [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4699.58s)]
*  because I said I was something I was not. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4702.5s)]
*  So NRCC is not National Republican campaign committee. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4704.5s)]
*  Yeah, committing, yeah. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4707.82s)]
*  Is not asking you this. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4708.66s)]
*  But I'm being forced. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4710.74s)]
*  The DOJ is requiring it. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4711.58s)]
*  Is forcing me because they needed that number [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4712.9800000000005s)]
*  in order to get the points higher [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4715.46s)]
*  to get to the 87 month sentence. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4717.06s)]
*  Oh, it's all so grotesque. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4719.5s)]
*  By the way, I forgot to ask you, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4721.86s)]
*  what did your colleagues think of Trump? [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4722.7s)]
*  Like behind the scenes, what did they say about Donald Trump? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4724.58s)]
*  I love seeing the fakery. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4727.0199999999995s)]
*  If I got a dollar for every time I heard somebody say, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4730.419999999999s)]
*  he's not gonna get elected, this is nonsense, [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4733.78s)]
*  we need to move on from him, I'd be a billionaire. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4736.0199999999995s)]
*  You'd be able to pay your legal fees. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4739.099999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4742.139999999999s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be going to prison. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4743.94s)]
*  You feel the fraudulence. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4745.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, Mark Green is one, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4747.54s)]
*  the chairman of the Homeland, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4749.82s)]
*  who's now stepping down [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4750.82s)]
*  because he's doing some gold deal in Guyana, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4751.98s)]
*  but is still serving while he's negotiated employment terms. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4755.94s)]
*  Don't even get me started on that one. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4760.58s)]
*  He's negotiating a gold deal in Guyana [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4762.62s)]
*  while still in Congress? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4764.54s)]
*  Yes, and he's notified the ethics committee [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4765.7s)]
*  according to his own public statements [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4767.7s)]
*  and everything is kosher. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4769.299999999999s)]
*  They're aware that I've already have [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4770.74s)]
*  employment terms secured. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4772.099999999999s)]
*  I'm like, you're lobbying for a new job [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4773.54s)]
*  while still holding a position of public trust? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4776.94s)]
*  That's per se freaking criminal. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4780.179999999999s)]
*  I would say. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4783.82s)]
*  What are we doing? [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4785.66s)]
*  So, you have him, you have so many fraudsters there. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4786.58s)]
*  President Trump has about a good three dozen [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4791.860000000001s)]
*  real allies in the House. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4794.3s)]
*  That's about a real three dozen real allies [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4796.5s)]
*  like Elise Stefanik, Marjorie, Lauren. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4800.38s)]
*  Those are his allies. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4802.9800000000005s)]
*  The rest, they're just as dumbfounded [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4804.3s)]
*  as probably the Democrats are that he got elected. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4806.860000000001s)]
*  And they don't like him. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4810.1s)]
*  They don't like him. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4810.9400000000005s)]
*  And they're fake. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4812.22s)]
*  They're very fake. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4813.26s)]
*  It's this posturing and it's painful [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4815.26s)]
*  because I know some of the guys who work [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4818.26s)]
*  for President Trump who vet this crap, and they know. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4820.54s)]
*  Obviously they need to play nicer [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4823.9s)]
*  or else they're gonna stall his agenda. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4825.179999999999s)]
*  So, I'm not here to tell the president [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4826.66s)]
*  to go scorch earth on them, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4828.5s)]
*  but I just want him to know. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4830.34s)]
*  There's a lot of fake people there, [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4832.98s)]
*  people who were literally trashing him. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4834.94s)]
*  I mean, it just... [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4837.86s)]
*  What do you think Mike Johnson thinks of him? [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4839.66s)]
*  I mean, look, I'll say this about Mike. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4842.0199999999995s)]
*  I know Mike is a supporter because he was in his... [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4843.9s)]
*  He was in the courtroom. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4850.58s)]
*  Not just the courtroom. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4851.74s)]
*  Forget that. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4852.94s)]
*  I can tell you a bunch of those who showed up there [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4853.78s)]
*  who really care for Trump. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4855.46s)]
*  He was in his impeachment defense team. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4857.38s)]
*  So, if you're putting yourself in the first term, [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4859.82s)]
*  if you're putting yourself in that position, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4863.42s)]
*  you care for the guy like Lee Zeldin cares for him. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4864.94s)]
*  I think President Trump's biggest allies [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4867.86s)]
*  are already around him with the exception of Elise, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4869.86s)]
*  who I kind of feel got a raw deal with what happens, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4871.9s)]
*  or she should be the UN ambassador. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4875.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't understand what that was about. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4876.54s)]
*  It's backstabbing. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4878.82s)]
*  I mean, Elise is a knife holder. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4880.219999999999s)]
*  She's the new knife holder in Congress. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4881.78s)]
*  Everybody backstabbed her on that. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4883.58s)]
*  That wasn't by design. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4885.66s)]
*  That was purposefully done to hurt her. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4888.339999999999s)]
*  And I think it's really wrong what they did to Elise. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4891.139999999999s)]
*  Who did it, do you think? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4893.299999999999s)]
*  Look, the speaker I know lobbied, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4894.94s)]
*  begging for him to stop pulling from the house [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4896.58s)]
*  and ask him to reconsider Elise. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4898.66s)]
*  And I have that on good authority. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4900.62s)]
*  I mean, nobody gave me receipts, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4901.9s)]
*  but I spoke to enough people. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4903.46s)]
*  Once you hear something from more than three people [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4905.34s)]
*  and it's the same exact words, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4907.66s)]
*  you start believing that it's credible. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4909.9s)]
*  And I think that's the standard for reporting, right? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4912.1s)]
*  Yeah, it was a standard in life. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4914.9s)]
*  You don't need to give me a receipt or a text message [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4916.18s)]
*  or a recorded phone call, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4918.5s)]
*  because if three different people [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4920.0599999999995s)]
*  within a specific spectrum in DC, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4922.34s)]
*  all were able to, and I didn't just hear it from three, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4926.78s)]
*  I heard it from about four or five. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4928.74s)]
*  And they all said the same thing, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4930.86s)]
*  that the speaker was asking him to reconsider [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4931.98s)]
*  because he was concerned about what was gonna happen [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4933.82s)]
*  in her primary up there, in her special election up there. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4935.42s)]
*  I believe he's culpable. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4939.5s)]
*  And that's why I believe he bought back the position [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4941.0599999999995s)]
*  of the chair of the leadership, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4943.5s)]
*  because it's guilt. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4947.219999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm not accusing him of anything nefarious. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4949.98s)]
*  No, I get it. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4952.42s)]
*  I'm just explaining that math is hard. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4953.26s)]
*  And this math was simple. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4956.58s)]
*  If she left and that special election went to hell, [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4958.18s)]
*  that meant we wouldn't have one more seat. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4961.5s)]
*  And that would have made things even more tight. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4964.34s)]
*  I don't think that's crazy. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4966.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, that seems like a totally legitimate explanation. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4968.02s)]
*  And rumors are she's very unhappy as she should be. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4971.18s)]
*  I would be a bull with tits. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4974.34s)]
*  I would see red everywhere I go. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4979.3s)]
*  I don't know how she's still smiling on camera. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4982.02s)]
*  I'd just be sour puss galore. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4984.1s)]
*  Do you enjoy serving in the house? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4986.06s)]
*  Some do, I did. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4988.34s)]
*  Despite everything, it was an honor of a lifetime. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4989.820000000001s)]
*  I don't think I'd ever do it again, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4993.860000000001s)]
*  because I don't think there's anything happening there [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4996.34s)]
*  that I think I can be more effective out here [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=4998.660000000001s)]
*  than in there. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5002.42s)]
*  Educating people on how it works and how dirty it is. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5004.06s)]
*  Because I will be well sourced in the house [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5006.46s)]
*  for at least another decade and a half. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5009.38s)]
*  With time, it dwindles down, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5012.9800000000005s)]
*  but I will be well sourced at least for a decade and a half. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5014.54s)]
*  A lot of people who came in this Congress, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5017.58s)]
*  I already knew them too, from trying previously [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5019.34s)]
*  or just from knowing them from the MAGA world. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5022.5s)]
*  So again, there's always that. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5025.1s)]
*  So there's some people who enjoy it. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5027.18s)]
*  I enjoyed it very much. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5030.38s)]
*  It was an honor of a lifetime. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5031.54s)]
*  I'm a people person. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5032.7s)]
*  I love helping people. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5033.62s)]
*  It's something I enjoy. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5034.86s)]
*  And that job gave me the official authority to help people. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5036.58s)]
*  And I found it very fun. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5039.86s)]
*  I had Wednesdays, I would answer calls in my office. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5041.9800000000005s)]
*  Again, remember Tucker, I had no committee assignments. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5045.3s)]
*  So I was pretty free. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5047.26s)]
*  So I started answering phone calls every Wednesday. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5048.5s)]
*  Just pick up the phone. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5051.820000000001s)]
*  Pick up the phone. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5052.66s)]
*  I just be like, [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5053.9800000000005s)]
*  Office of Congressman George Santos, how can I help you? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5055.22s)]
*  Who's this? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5057.3s)]
*  I'm like, this is a congressman. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5058.14s)]
*  No way. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5058.9800000000005s)]
*  You pick up your own phone while everybody abandoned? [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5063.3s)]
*  I'm like, no, everybody's busy. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5065.14s)]
*  The phone was ringing and I'm available. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5066.22s)]
*  How can I help you? [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5067.62s)]
*  People would be so shocked. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5069.02s)]
*  Because a lot of these times it was just agitators [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5070.58s)]
*  calling to nag. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5072.5s)]
*  And I'm like, how can I help you? [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5074.06s)]
*  Well, you know, congressman, listen, [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5075.26s)]
*  I take great issue with you, [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5077.06s)]
*  but I'm actually shocked you answered your own phone. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5078.66s)]
*  I'm like, I mean, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5080.78s)]
*  what's wrong with answering your own phone? [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5082.7s)]
*  I'm not a Lord with a pointy hat sitting in a throne. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5084.14s)]
*  I'm like, I answered my own phone. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5087.7s)]
*  So I would have very interesting conversations. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5090.46s)]
*  I regularly, when I was not in DC, [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5093.74s)]
*  I kept the schedule of nine to five in my district office. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5097.26s)]
*  I showed up to work every day. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5100.38s)]
*  And my staff, my chief of staff would find that so strange [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5102.02s)]
*  being a veteran on the Hill. [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5104.66s)]
*  And even my district director [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5105.78s)]
*  who worked for Lee Seldin previously for four terms, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5107.82s)]
*  eight years, found that very odd. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5110.58s)]
*  Like, sir, you don't have to be here. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5113.22s)]
*  Do you have any events, any public agenda? [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5115.46s)]
*  I'm like, no, but I'm on the clock. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5117.14s)]
*  I'm getting paid. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5120.34s)]
*  So what can I do to help? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5121.18s)]
*  And they'd sit there very uncomfortable. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5123.1s)]
*  I mean, I'm the principal and I'm sitting there [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5124.9400000000005s)]
*  and it's a small space and it's just like [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5127.06s)]
*  all stiff on the computer. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5129.46s)]
*  I'm like, guys, you can act normal. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5130.7s)]
*  Please don't pretend you're busy. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5133.54s)]
*  Cause if you're not busy, [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5134.9s)]
*  then that means you're ahead on the work. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5135.74s)]
*  But if you're backed up, let me help. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5137.26s)]
*  And I did constituent work. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5139.62s)]
*  I don't care. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5141.9s)]
*  I totally loved it. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5142.9s)]
*  People would walk by and be like, you actually show up. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5143.82s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, come on in. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5145.9s)]
*  You want some water? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5147.74s)]
*  I got diet Coke in the bag. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5148.78s)]
*  I got snacks. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5149.9800000000005s)]
*  I kept the hefty stockpile of snacks on the taxpayer dime [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5150.9800000000005s)]
*  because it was for the taxpayer. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5155.3s)]
*  What kind of snacks? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5157.66s)]
*  Pirate booties was a big favorite. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5159.42s)]
*  It's like an organic puff of, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5161.86s)]
*  I think it's an organic popcorn. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5164.66s)]
*  I'm very conscious about labels. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5166.66s)]
*  So seed oils or those things are no, no, no, no extreme dyes. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5169.219999999999s)]
*  So I'm like very in line with the Maha movement, right? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5174.0199999999995s)]
*  In Congress, I compared a Dan and nutrition facts label [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5177.179999999999s)]
*  from America, yogurt, and one from Europe. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5180.34s)]
*  Europe has five ingredients, the American one [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5183.46s)]
*  and for strawberry yogurt, the American one had everything [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5185.82s)]
*  but strawberries and like 19 ingredients. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5188.94s)]
*  So at least, so I would keep a lot of pirate booties [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5192.18s)]
*  and some Hershey kisses. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5194.94s)]
*  Try to keep it really fun for people. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5197.1s)]
*  I saw over here, you keep dry fruit. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5198.9s)]
*  I'm a big dry fruit guy. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5200.9s)]
*  I like dry fruit. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5202.1s)]
*  I love dry fruit. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5202.94s)]
*  I don't know if it's good for you, but I like it. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5203.78s)]
*  Mango dry fruit, the best. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5205.5s)]
*  Did you ever see the brand Peeled? [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5207.18s)]
*  Yeah, we've got some over there. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5209.38s)]
*  So good. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5210.38s)]
*  I buy that by the bags. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5211.22s)]
*  I love it. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5214.38s)]
*  I know that it's really good for you, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5216.06s)]
*  but it's really high fructose for sure, but so good. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5216.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I like it too much. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5219.26s)]
*  So I know it's not good. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5220.9400000000005s)]
*  Anything I like is not good. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5222.14s)]
*  That's kind of me. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5223.3s)]
*  So you're going away in 24 days. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5224.14s)]
*  I asked you off camera, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5227.1s)]
*  I know a million people going to prison. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5228.54s)]
*  I know more people going to prison than most people. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5230.02s)]
*  And I always ask everybody the same, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5232.900000000001s)]
*  like you don't think you deserve the sentence. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5234.42s)]
*  You think you got screwed in your case. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5237.3s)]
*  I agree with you. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5239.58s)]
*  I'm a first time offender. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5240.42s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's nuts. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5241.26s)]
*  I wasn't even given those credits. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5242.54s)]
*  I mean, if the system's not going to be fair, [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5245.74s)]
*  then why do you have to play along with the system? [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5248.259999999999s)]
*  Why don't you just split? [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5249.94s)]
*  I'm proud. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5252.66s)]
*  I'm extremely proud. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5253.78s)]
*  I'd rather go down with the ship. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5255.54s)]
*  Like the same way that I said put up or shut up [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5256.98s)]
*  and didn't leave and then quit, I don't run, I don't split. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5259.219999999999s)]
*  And I could, right? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5262.0199999999995s)]
*  And that's why they called me a flight risk [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5263.219999999999s)]
*  and they sequestered my passports [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5265.219999999999s)]
*  because I'm a dual citizen by birth, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5267.98s)]
*  but I was born here, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5269.42s)]
*  but my parents are legal immigrants to this country. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5270.299999999999s)]
*  From where? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5274.46s)]
*  Brazil. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5275.3s)]
*  And through my grandparents, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5276.5s)]
*  I also am legally a Belgium citizen. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5278.46s)]
*  So they sequestered my documents and all of that. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5282.46s)]
*  And here we are. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5285.18s)]
*  But you never seriously considered [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5287.66s)]
*  Never. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5289.1s)]
*  Stowing away to Antwerp. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5289.9400000000005s)]
*  Inquire, reach out the rag, reached out. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5291.38s)]
*  I was still in office and saying that he had gotten a tip [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5294.860000000001s)]
*  that I was planning to flee. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5298.7s)]
*  And this was like, I wanna say June of 2023 [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5300.42s)]
*  that he had multiple sources confirming [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5304.9400000000005s)]
*  that I had planned to flee in a private jet [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5307.06s)]
*  and I was gonna split the country. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5309.06s)]
*  And I had just been indicted probably a month earlier. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5311.58s)]
*  And I called my comms director told me this. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5314.9800000000005s)]
*  I said, let's call this guy. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5320.14s)]
*  I put all my lawyers on the line, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5322.22s)]
*  put the call on speaker, called him from my office phone. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5325.1s)]
*  I had my chief of staff, my communications director, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5328.9800000000005s)]
*  my deputy chief of staff, my operations director, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5334.3s)]
*  and my senior advisor all sitting in the room. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5337.26s)]
*  And I said, hi, how can I help you? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5341.700000000001s)]
*  Oh, congressman, this is Inquire. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5342.860000000001s)]
*  I'm the chief editor, forgot the loser's name, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5344.3s)]
*  could care less. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5347.1s)]
*  And he says, I have on good authority [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5349.34s)]
*  that you're planning to flee in a week or two [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5351.54s)]
*  in a private jet that you arranged. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5354.22s)]
*  I'm gonna keep it PG here, but I said, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5358.5s)]
*  and who told you this marvelous story? [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5360.5s)]
*  Mary Poppins, you effing inbred. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5363.18s)]
*  Like, and then it went from there. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5366.62s)]
*  And I said, I dare you to publish it. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5368.9800000000005s)]
*  I will sue you, I will own your fucking rag. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5371.46s)]
*  And my attorney's on my ear. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5375.860000000001s)]
*  He's like, congressman, that's not, no, no, no. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5378.02s)]
*  You're provoking him. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5381.14s)]
*  And then I'm like, and furthermore, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5381.9800000000005s)]
*  I will hunt down your entire goddamn sorry lineage. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5384.14s)]
*  Fucking do it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5388.26s)]
*  I dared him, it never happened. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5389.42s)]
*  I hung up, the entire staff goes to me and is like, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5392.740000000001s)]
*  that's not how this call was supposed to go. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5395.22s)]
*  I'm like, you know what, I'm tired of playing [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5397.38s)]
*  by whatever recommendations you guys give. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5399.26s)]
*  Well, I mean, a call like that from a journalist [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5400.9800000000005s)]
*  is almost always inspired by a call to him from somebody else. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5405.22s)]
*  He's doing the bidding of somebody else. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5407.820000000001s)]
*  They're like, DOJ is encouraging this, right? [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5409.3s)]
*  They want the story to be out there [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5413.1s)]
*  that you're considering fleeing the country so they can. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5414.820000000001s)]
*  Just like CNN was informed [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5417.740000000001s)]
*  that I was indicted before I was. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5419.26s)]
*  No way. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5421.860000000001s)]
*  Two hours before we were notified of the indictment, [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5423.580000000001s)]
*  my attorney, Joseph Murray, got a call from CNN saying, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5426.06s)]
*  hey, I heard George Anis is indicted. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5429.3s)]
*  What are you doing? [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5432.580000000001s)]
*  And he's like, I'm sorry, this is news to me. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5433.46s)]
*  The guy goes silent. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5436.22s)]
*  Two hours later, he's like, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5437.38s)]
*  hey, now I know you've been notified [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5438.22s)]
*  that he's been indicted. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5440.18s)]
*  And my attorney was like, what is going on? [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5441.3s)]
*  CNN knew two hours prior to me getting indicted. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5444.1s)]
*  So disgusting. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5446.9800000000005s)]
*  How do you feel about it? [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5448.74s)]
*  I mean, looking at this long stretch. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5449.9400000000005s)]
*  Tucker, can I be honest with you? [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5453.14s)]
*  I hope you will. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5454.66s)]
*  I don't know that I survive it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5456.46s)]
*  They're putting me in a violent prison. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5458.38s)]
*  It's a medium facility. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5460.3s)]
*  I'm not a streetwise guy. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5462.02s)]
*  I don't know how to fight. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5464.14s)]
*  I'm a gay man. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5465.7s)]
*  Statistics tell you what happens to gay men in prison. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5467.3s)]
*  I don't know that I survive this. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5470.26s)]
*  I'm being honest. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5471.7s)]
*  I mean, I can't change that. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5472.54s)]
*  It's sad. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5475.34s)]
*  I have a family. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5477.1s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5478.7s)]
*  I'm genuinely serious. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5479.54s)]
*  People think I'm exaggerating when I say this. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5481.18s)]
*  I've never had to fight a day in my life. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5483.7s)]
*  I grew up in a very sheltered life, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5485.900000000001s)]
*  apartment kid in New York City. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5487.66s)]
*  I don't have wilderness. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5490.02s)]
*  I mean, my experience in wilderness, let's call it, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5491.58s)]
*  I like skiing. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5493.780000000001s)]
*  But it's just not me. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5496.18s)]
*  I'm not that guy. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5498.38s)]
*  I don't know that I survive this. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5499.26s)]
*  I mean, this could be very much my last interview. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5500.54s)]
*  And I'm not trying to be over dramatic here. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5504.22s)]
*  I'm just being honest with you. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5505.860000000001s)]
*  I look at this as practically a death sentence [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5507.26s)]
*  to what could occur to me. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5509.54s)]
*  And we've seen this. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5511.02s)]
*  It's not like I'm saying something out of the ordinary. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5512.38s)]
*  I'm not built for this. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5514.5s)]
*  And I'm not saying, oh, don't wanna do the time, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5517.38s)]
*  don't do the crime. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5520.5s)]
*  This isn't about this. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5521.740000000001s)]
*  This is about the type of punishment. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5523.780000000001s)]
*  The justice system is supposed to be reformative [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5527.14s)]
*  for people, not punitive. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5530.18s)]
*  This is punitive. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5531.46s)]
*  We're supposed to dispense justice. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5532.3s)]
*  This is punitive. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5534.06s)]
*  And justice is, of course, absolute. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5534.900000000001s)]
*  Some things are absolutely right, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5536.66s)]
*  others absolutely wrong. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5537.54s)]
*  But it's also a relative measure. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5538.900000000001s)]
*  So if a rapist doesn't get seven years, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5540.46s)]
*  then a guy who's accused of mishandling $50,000 [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5543.18s)]
*  in campaign contributions shouldn't get seven years. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5545.9800000000005s)]
*  Like that's just doesn't, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5548.22s)]
*  I mean, that's part of justice, right? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5549.3s)]
*  That's the crux of it. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5551.38s)]
*  Right, there's a scale of severity [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5552.66s)]
*  when we describe crimes. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5554.9s)]
*  The guy who threatened and plotted to kill Anna Luna Paulina, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5556.58s)]
*  he had three years. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5563.099999999999s)]
*  The guy who plotted to kill me got probation. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5565.179999999999s)]
*  Seriously? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5568.219999999999s)]
*  Serious, it's public record. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5569.0599999999995s)]
*  Guy down in Florida, I think Brevard County. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5571.0599999999995s)]
*  I chose not to ask for like some punitive thing [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5574.219999999999s)]
*  because he didn't actually do it or try, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5578.66s)]
*  but he did devise a plan and notify me of the plan. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5581.46s)]
*  And that's why Capitol Police took action. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5585.9s)]
*  And he didn't get any time. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5588.42s)]
*  Rapists in New York State, up in upstate New York, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5592.58s)]
*  there was this guy who molested nine different children. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5596.72s)]
*  That's six months, six months. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5601.1s)]
*  They're sending me for seven years [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5604.5s)]
*  and three months to prison in a medium facility prison [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5605.82s)]
*  with people there who are known gang members [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5609.14s)]
*  and people who are rapists, sex offenders. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5613.34s)]
*  I should at bare minimum be in a camp. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5616.26s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm special or I deserve special treatment. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5618.58s)]
*  It's just about, I'm kind of violent person. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5621.740000000001s)]
*  I'm a pacifist squared. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5624.14s)]
*  Like I don't get into physical altercations. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5628.820000000001s)]
*  You can come in my face, spit, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5631.22s)]
*  I don't have this urge to be violent. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5635.06s)]
*  I'm not violent. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5637.06s)]
*  I'm a total nonviolent human being. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5637.94s)]
*  Hence I'm also a very non-introventionist type of person [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5639.98s)]
*  when it comes to war. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5643.54s)]
*  So this is like so bonkers and there's nothing you can do. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5644.74s)]
*  The only thing I can do as a human being today is pray [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5649.099999999999s)]
*  that my pardon application or clemency application, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5652.48s)]
*  commutation, whatever, reaches the DOJ on time [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5656.58s)]
*  and President Trump can act on it. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5659.66s)]
*  That's literally the only thing I have on my mind. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5661.099999999999s)]
*  Who do you think is advocating for you to do seven years? [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5662.94s)]
*  Who's whispering in the presidency [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5665.299999999999s)]
*  that you need to serve seven years in prison? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5666.7s)]
*  A few people. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5669.18s)]
*  Can you name any? [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5670.099999999999s)]
*  Of course, the County Executive of Nassau County, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5670.94s)]
*  Bruce Blakeman, the Chairman of Nassau County, Joe Cairo, [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5673.74s)]
*  former Congressman Anthony De Esposito, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5677.26s)]
*  Congressman Nick La Lota. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5679.34s)]
*  These people hate me. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5680.7s)]
*  It's vitriolic, it's personal. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5682.0199999999995s)]
*  But seven years in prison for a nonviolent crime? [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5683.42s)]
*  Some people said that it wasn't enough. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5685.78s)]
*  There were people actually saying [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5688.0199999999995s)]
*  they didn't think it was enough. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5689.26s)]
*  Congressman La Lota was cheering it on his social media. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5690.98s)]
*  Man, I think we should be careful [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5694.379999999999s)]
*  before we cheer other people's destruction. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5696.0199999999995s)]
*  I completely agree. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5697.98s)]
*  That's a principle we should all remember. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5700.219999999999s)]
*  I didn't cheer when they shot Osama Bin Laden, [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5702.46s)]
*  and I didn't like Osama Bin Laden, but. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5704.219999999999s)]
*  I didn't cheer. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5706.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't cheer anyone's death, period. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5706.86s)]
*  I disagreed with killing Saddam Hussein. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5708.139999999999s)]
*  I thought it was a mistake. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5709.86s)]
*  Well, it turned out to be, you were right on that. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5710.98s)]
*  And it was a very unpopular take at the time. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5714.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, Iran controls the country, so. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5716.78s)]
*  Very, very, very, very. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5718.54s)]
*  No, none of the geniuses have ever apologized to that. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5720.139999999999s)]
*  No, but in general, wishing misfortune on other people, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5722.86s)]
*  taking pleasure in the suffering of others, [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5726.139999999999s)]
*  it's not a good thing to do. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5728.46s)]
*  It's very unwise. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5730.219999999999s)]
*  It's just bad karma. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5731.0599999999995s)]
*  Big time. Big time. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5732.0599999999995s)]
*  And the world goes around. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5733.0599999999995s)]
*  I completely agree. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5734.94s)]
*  And karma comes with it and slaps you in the face. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5735.78s)]
*  It's almost like when you're on the merry-go-round [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5738.82s)]
*  and you have your hand out and you're slapping people. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5741.78s)]
*  That's karma on the world. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5744.0199999999995s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5745.179999999999s)]
*  It's pretty bad. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5746.0199999999995s)]
*  When I was in prison, you visited me. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5746.86s)]
*  That's what we're commanded to do. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5747.86s)]
*  So do you expect to be visited and by whom? [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5749.54s)]
*  So I'm not allowed to, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5752.98s)]
*  because I'm a high profiler, they call celebrity status. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5754.42s)]
*  They only allow family members. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5757.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5760.34s)]
*  I don't know what my technology situation is right now. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5762.14s)]
*  If I'm gonna have access to technology, that's dicey. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5764.7s)]
*  We, you know, two of my employers said that they, [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5768.06s)]
*  I can keep writing for them from prison. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5771.3s)]
*  They don't mind. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5773.62s)]
*  They know that I can figure it out and, you know, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5774.82s)]
*  whatever access. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5778.1s)]
*  And that also helps me be able to maintain myself [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5778.9400000000005s)]
*  gainfully employed to continue to support [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5781.820000000001s)]
*  and provide for my family, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5784.14s)]
*  which I'm a big provider for them. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5785.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5788.14s)]
*  I don't know that that's all up in the air. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5789.34s)]
*  It's, they only start talking to you two weeks out. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5791.22s)]
*  So next week is when we start to have these conversations. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5793.860000000001s)]
*  You ever looked at prison TikTok? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5795.9800000000005s)]
*  Huh? [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5797.26s)]
*  You ever looked at prison TikTok? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5798.1s)]
*  I have not, no. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5798.9400000000005s)]
*  I haven't either, but I was just hearing about it [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5800.06s)]
*  the other day. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5801.46s)]
*  Apparently prisoners are all over TikTok [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5802.3s)]
*  recording their thoughts and music videos [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5804.34s)]
*  and stuff from prison. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5806.580000000001s)]
*  The last thing I want to do is get caught with a phone [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5807.42s)]
*  and add more time. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5809.1s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5810.18s)]
*  Last question. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5812.58s)]
*  What are you doing to prepare psychologically? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5813.66s)]
*  I've tried everything. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5816.66s)]
*  I went off, I went on a hiatus. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5818.06s)]
*  I haven't done media until last week when Mandami, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5820.02s)]
*  I was on a six week media hiatus [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5823.78s)]
*  and Chanel Rion from OAN had me to, I love Chanel. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5825.86s)]
*  And I said, you know what? [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5829.86s)]
*  I'll give you one last, we'll do a last one, right? [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5831.3s)]
*  And then when one of your production folks called me, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5834.34s)]
*  I said, I answered the phone and I said her name. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5838.1s)]
*  And she's like, you have my phone number saved. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5841.14s)]
*  I'm like, of course I would. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5843.1s)]
*  I don't want to say her name [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5844.9400000000005s)]
*  because I don't want to dox her. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5845.900000000001s)]
*  So she's like, can you do it? [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5847.34s)]
*  I'm like, look, I can do it. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5849.1s)]
*  Last time you agreed to do my show, it didn't go well. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5850.54s)]
*  I told her that. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5853.66s)]
*  Sorry, sorry, sorry. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5854.5s)]
*  So I said, no fill-ins, right? [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5855.62s)]
*  No surprises, but all kidding aside, she was wonderful. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5857.62s)]
*  And we found, this was Sturzann [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5861.3s)]
*  and here we are today, Monday. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5863.7s)]
*  It's because I was having this conversation [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5864.66s)]
*  with somebody who knows you, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5866.14s)]
*  the other right here on this bar and like last week [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5867.78s)]
*  and George, I was talking to George Santos [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5869.82s)]
*  and I said, how's George Santos doing? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5872.26s)]
*  And he's doing seven years. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5873.54s)]
*  I was like, what? [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5875.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5876.78s)]
*  Couldn't even, I'm so out of it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5877.62s)]
*  And I'm just, and I've been so focused on Iran [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5879.0199999999995s)]
*  and I'm embarrassed. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5880.5s)]
*  I didn't fully get it, seven years federal? [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5881.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5884.18s)]
*  Which means like seven years. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5885.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5885.98s)]
*  And I said to this person, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5887.0199999999995s)]
*  that's the craziest thing I've ever heard. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5887.86s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5889.5s)]
*  Has this gotten a lot of attention? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5890.82s)]
*  Not really, no. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5892.66s)]
*  I haven't, I mean, the day I got sentenced, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5894.58s)]
*  they wrote little, oh, he sobbed in court. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5896.78s)]
*  You damn right I sobbed in court. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5900.3s)]
*  Seven years of my life. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5901.7s)]
*  I mean, a big thing, I'm 36. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5902.74s)]
*  I'm gonna be 37 on July 22nd and three days later, [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5905.099999999999s)]
*  I have to turn myself into federal prison for seven years. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5907.66s)]
*  So once the pinata party's over, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5910.86s)]
*  once they've finished destroying you, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5912.5s)]
*  knocking the stuffing out of you, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5914.46s)]
*  they just, no one cares what happens next. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5915.42s)]
*  Your name is never spoken again. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5918.82s)]
*  Well, we'll be here. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5919.98s)]
*  And I hope you are rescued before you have [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5921.46s)]
*  to serve the time. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5924.3s)]
*  And I hope that if you're not, that it's redemptive. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5925.14s)]
*  And I hope either way you'll come back. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5928.46s)]
*  I appreciate it, thank you. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5929.9800000000005s)]
*  George Santos, good to see you. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5931.46s)]
*  Dr. Carlson, thank you for having me. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5932.7s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5938.66s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising, that's what they do. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5941.94s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5944.26s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5946.02s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5947.94s)]
*  and our politics, with the wars, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5950.58s)]
*  we're on the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5952.38s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5954.54s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5957.54s)]
*  And that is totally wrong, it's immoral. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5958.9s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5962.3s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, that's a waste of time. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5963.82s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5966.42s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5967.46s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5968.74s)]
*  that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5970.94s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5973.74s)]
*  we think it's to subscribe to our channel, subscribe. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5975.42s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5978.14s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5980.9800000000005s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5982.66s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5984.860000000001s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdVCF2dOZZI&t=5987.820000000001s)]
