# Chris Josephs: Nancy Pelosi, Dan Crenshaw, and How They Get Rich at Your Expense
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [February 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys)
*  So Nancy Pelosi's stock tracker is one of those things that I first saw on X on Twitter, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=0.0s)]
*  and I thought this cannot be, this is obviously fake. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=5.96s)]
*  In fact, I didn't even consider for a second that it could be real. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=8.36s)]
*  And then I was sent it by a buddy of mine who spent 30 years on Wall Street. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=12.34s)]
*  Have you seen this? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=15.64s)]
*  And I was like, is this real? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=16.64s)]
*  He's like, it's totally real. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=17.64s)]
*  We're just talking off camera. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=19.32s)]
*  It's like at 55, it's shocking for me. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=21.0s)]
*  It's hard to accept how corrupt leadership of the country is. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I almost can't metabolize it, but I don't think anything has put it into clearer relief [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=28.88s)]
*  than what you have done. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=34.0s)]
*  So you run Nancy Pelosi's stock tracker. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=35.2s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=58.72s)]
*  First of all, I'm really glad to meet you. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=59.72s)]
*  Yeah, not a problem. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=60.72s)]
*  And to know that you're real. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=61.72s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=62.72s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=63.72s)]
*  How'd you do that? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=65.36s)]
*  How'd the whole thing start? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=66.36s)]
*  I mean, I'm 29 now. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=67.36s)]
*  At 25, would I say that, you know, looking five years from then, I'll be running a Pelosi [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=69.92s)]
*  stock tracker, building an app with the slogan, invest like a politician, having that thing [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=75.12s)]
*  become a thing? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=79.08s)]
*  No, I don't think I would have ever gotten to that. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=80.08s)]
*  So at 25, I was actually living in Bali. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=84.24s)]
*  I quit my New York City job when I was doing finance, and I started working on my family [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=86.56s)]
*  company where we would sell sports compression products. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=91.24s)]
*  Like little ones with numbers on them, custom ones that you would get for your kid for, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=94.0s)]
*  you know, peewee football. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  And I was so sick of the finance grind in New York that I was like, I'm going to work [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  on this family thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=102.68s)]
*  I'm going to try and take it up to another level. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=103.68s)]
*  I'll go travel around, move to Bali. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  Was working out there for probably like six or seven months. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=107.84s)]
*  Moved back to Boston, was where I'm from. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=111.72s)]
*  Then went up to New Hampshire, became a snowboard instructor. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=116.08000000000001s)]
*  Was working on the ski slopes. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, there's a whole story behind it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  Was working on the ski slopes as a snowboard instructor. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=122.8s)]
*  Where in New Hampshire? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=126.16s)]
*  Bretton Woods. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=127.08s)]
*  Great, great mountain. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=127.92s)]
*  Very family friendly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=128.92s)]
*  And this is my phone. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=129.84s)]
*  We're all up there. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=130.76s)]
*  And then when COVID hit, moved back in with my family. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=132.44s)]
*  And then that's how I connected with my co-founders Brian, Aaron and Scott. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=134.96s)]
*  They're out in LA. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=138.28s)]
*  And there's a whole story on how I essentially connected with them, which we can get into. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=139.72s)]
*  But we started building an app together. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  And long story short, I'm sure we'll get into the majority of this stuff. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=146.64s)]
*  We essentially built out on a tech side, the first way to follow your friends' stock portfolios. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  So if you had a Robin Hood and I had a Weeble or a Fidelity, we would connect it to our app. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=156.04s)]
*  And you can get push notifications of when a trade would happen. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=160.35999999999999s)]
*  I was the co-founder of it and I was in charge of the growth. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=163.6s)]
*  And one obvious way to do it, this was during the GameStop era was, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=166.44s)]
*  let me build a Nancy Pelosi portfolio. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=171.16s)]
*  I'm seeing on Twitter, I'm seeing on TikTok, I'm seeing on Instagram, politicians crushing it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=173.32s)]
*  And them getting called out for their trades, especially during COVID. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=178.79999999999998s)]
*  I never will forget it. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=183.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you covered it, the Richard Burr. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=184.92s)]
*  Yeah, I knew Richard Burr. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=187.44s)]
*  I was never against Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=188.72s)]
*  And I saw that and it looked like corruption to me. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=191.44s)]
*  I was disgusted by it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=194.6s)]
*  They got investigated by the DOJ, investigated by the SEC. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=196.88s)]
*  Nothing happened. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  And that story is insane. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think that story was where it really started to get... [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=202.56s)]
*  Can you just give us the outline of it for people to forget? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  So, Unusual Whales, he's an account on X. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=207.16s)]
*  He was the one that initially started all this. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=210.04s)]
*  So the Pelosi tracker came... [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=211.68s)]
*  Do you know him? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=212.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, we work with him. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=214.72s)]
*  I love his... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=216.6s)]
*  I don't know his name or anything about him, but I love that feed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=217.44s)]
*  Obscure guy, doesn't want the world to know about him, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  but he actually deserves so much credit for this stuff. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=223.04s)]
*  I don't think anyone would be... [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=226.32s)]
*  Unusual Whales. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=227.48s)]
*  Unusual Whales on Twitter. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=229.6s)]
*  He is the one that would essentially call them out at the beginning. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=230.12s)]
*  He started the Pelosi tracker in a way. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=233.2s)]
*  He was calling out the politician stuff. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=236.72s)]
*  And then the Pelosi tracker came probably in 2022, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=238.32s)]
*  but he started in 2020. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think Richard Burr, that whole story started [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=242.88s)]
*  because Unusual Whales started calling it out. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=246.08s)]
*  The story behind the Richard Burr is around his COVID trades. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  And it was a full on scandal. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=251.08s)]
*  You covered it at Fox News. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=252.68s)]
*  The story is on February 7th, 2020, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=254.32s)]
*  he wrote an op-ed with another senator saying, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=258.88s)]
*  hey, Americans, don't worry. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=261.72s)]
*  COVID's not that bad. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=264.04s)]
*  We're keeping an eye on it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=265.12s)]
*  Everything will be okay. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=266.16s)]
*  While he has and writes that op-ed, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=267.44s)]
*  he's getting insider kind of details [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=269.48s)]
*  because he sat as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=273.32000000000005s)]
*  while he was writing that op-ed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=276.68s)]
*  So while sitting as the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=278.20000000000005s)]
*  he's getting private meetings saying, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=281.68s)]
*  hey guys, COVID is actually way worse than we think. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=283.20000000000005s)]
*  This is not going to end the same way that people expect. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=285.68s)]
*  Be ready for some sort of rapid response. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=289.40000000000003s)]
*  And the head of SSCI, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=291.68s)]
*  is a major player. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=295.76s)]
*  He's not just an average senator. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=298.0s)]
*  That's a very important position in Washington, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=299.36s)]
*  in this country, in the world. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=302.56s)]
*  And so he would have access to a lot of information [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=304.12s)]
*  that fellow senators wouldn't have access to. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=306.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=308.68s)]
*  And he was tasked with partly like, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=309.52s)]
*  get ready for a response. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=311.48s)]
*  Once COVID hits, we think this is going to be bad. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  Get ready for a response. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=315.8s)]
*  Have your materials ready to tackle this situation. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=317.36s)]
*  So he probably knew the severity of it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  10X what the everyday American, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=325.96000000000004s)]
*  and also probably what other senators [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=327.88s)]
*  and representatives did as well. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=329.84000000000003s)]
*  So if you follow the timeline though, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=332.0s)]
*  February 7th is when he wrote that op-ed. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  February 13th is the day that he went [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=335.64000000000004s)]
*  and he sold off $1.65 million [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=338.88s)]
*  of his entire retirement account. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=341.32000000000005s)]
*  So a week after he told the American. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=343.36s)]
*  It was his retirement account. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=345.20000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, not only just a normal kind of investment account, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=346.04s)]
*  it was a retirement account. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=349.08000000000004s)]
*  He sold the whole thing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  Is it fair to say for non-investor [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  just to inform the rest of us [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=354.04s)]
*  who are not familiar with the details [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=355.28s)]
*  to sell off your retirement accounts [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=356.56s)]
*  so that you're not dicking around at that point? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=357.64s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=358.72s)]
*  Yeah, the retirement account is something you don't touch. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=359.92s)]
*  Those are the simply buy and hold, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=362.28s)]
*  never touch them forever. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=364.2s)]
*  But selling off that to that degree is extreme. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=365.72s)]
*  And I think is what caught a lot of people's attention [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=369.48s)]
*  of like, you don't just do that. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=372.0s)]
*  You don't just do that while you're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=375.4s)]
*  the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=377.04s)]
*  But to make this, this is why I get passionate about it. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=380.24s)]
*  It's like, I'm not even a political guy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll tell you the whole story of how this started. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=386.08s)]
*  I didn't grow up being obsessed with politics. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=387.76s)]
*  I just citizen journalists kind of see the opportunity [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  and be like, this is fucked up. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=393.0s)]
*  We should stop this. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=394.16s)]
*  The story though then goes, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=396.08s)]
*  February 13th, he sells off 1.65 million. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=397.8s)]
*  30 minutes later, he calls his brother-in-law [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=400.56s)]
*  and him and his brother-in-law [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=403.44s)]
*  have around a two minute conversation. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=404.92s)]
*  The brother-in-law hangs up the phone, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=407.08s)]
*  calls his financial advisor. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=409.71999999999997s)]
*  His financial advisor doesn't pick up. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=411.84s)]
*  He then calls his second financial advisor. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=413.84s)]
*  They pick up, they have around a 30 second conversation. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=416.52s)]
*  He then goes off and sells off $265,000 of his own portfolio. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=420.03999999999996s)]
*  So now you got the Senator [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  who's the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=427.64s)]
*  calling up his brother-in-law, them having a conversation [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=429.88s)]
*  and then the brother-in-law going and selling off [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=432.47999999999996s)]
*  30 seconds after that conversation. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  Now I don't, that's sketchy as hell to me. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=437.20000000000005s)]
*  The weird thing is that I know the brother-in-law [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=439.92s)]
*  was my neighbor and a super nice guy. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=442.04s)]
*  And I sort of knew her not really, but kind of, you know? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=444.52000000000004s)]
*  And so when you live in Washington, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=448.6s)]
*  I'm only saying that it's not unusual that I would know them [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=449.64000000000004s)]
*  because I lived in Washington my whole life. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=452.32000000000005s)]
*  But that's kind of one of the reasons [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=454.04s)]
*  we have all this corruption [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  is that everyone knows everybody else. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=456.52000000000004s)]
*  And it's just impossible to believe [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  that someone whose house you've been at many times [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=459.92s)]
*  and I have would do something like that. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=461.72s)]
*  The closer you are to something, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=464.76s)]
*  the harder it is to just like having an alcoholic spouse. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=465.68s)]
*  Like you're the last to know. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=467.56s)]
*  1000%. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=468.4s)]
*  And like the other argument to be had is like, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=469.24s)]
*  you know, around February 13th, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't remember the headlines that were coming out. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=473.4s)]
*  Like how extreme was that? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=476.68s)]
*  If you're the brother-in-law, of course you sell out. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=478.08s)]
*  You know, it's like, it's not like you're necessarily [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=480.56s)]
*  gonna listen to that, read all the headlines [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=482.96s)]
*  and do nothing about it. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=484.96s)]
*  So it's not even necessarily his fault for selling. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  And I don't think like that's where the insider trading [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=488.28s)]
*  necessarily happens. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  I think the culprit is the person [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=491.0s)]
*  who makes that initial phone call, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=492.96s)]
*  which is I think where the investigation happened. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=495.47999999999996s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=496.91999999999996s)]
*  So then what'd they do with the money? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=497.76s)]
*  They keep, so they, that happened on February 13th. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=499.84s)]
*  And then the storyline goes, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=503.64s)]
*  they started having private, Richard Burr [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=506.2s)]
*  started having private conversations with his donors. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=508.0s)]
*  And then the donors were starting to set all this stuff up. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=510.84s)]
*  A month later, not even a month, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=513.4s)]
*  three weeks after that around March, early March [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=515.4s)]
*  is when the market fell 30%. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=518.1999999999999s)]
*  And they saved themselves millions. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=520.28s)]
*  That all gets blown up because of again, unusual whales. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=523.12s)]
*  The SEC gets involved, the DOJ gets involved. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=526.2800000000001s)]
*  They then find nothing. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=529.32s)]
*  Well, they find all this information. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=530.6s)]
*  That's how we know about the tax the FBI came in, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=532.2s)]
*  but they don't charge them with anything. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  Nothing happens. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=536.72s)]
*  Richard Burr retires. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=537.96s)]
*  And you know, it's just like, again, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=539.6800000000001s)]
*  we were chatting about this off camera. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=542.32s)]
*  I'm 29, I grew up with this. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=543.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not surprised by it. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=545.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm just like, yeah. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=546.9200000000001s)]
*  Of course the politicians kinda can build this situation [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  where they benefit and people will come after them. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=551.0s)]
*  They'll make a facade, no charges will happen, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=555.28s)]
*  and they'll go off into the sunset. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=557.84s)]
*  So I was raised during the height of empire, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=559.64s)]
*  our Victorian era, and you were raised [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=562.2s)]
*  in the decline of empire, sort of the post-World War era. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=564.96s)]
*  So totally different perspective. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=568.04s)]
*  So you're much better situated to understand [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=569.96s)]
*  what's going on, to see it clearly, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=573.56s)]
*  to not lie to yourself about it. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=575.12s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=578.4s)]
*  So Burr, just to let you know, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=579.24s)]
*  since because I'm from DC, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  I don't think the head of the Senate Intel Committee [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=583.84s)]
*  can ever be charged with a crime [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=585.92s)]
*  because he knows too much. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=587.8s)]
*  He had to step down too while he was getting investigated. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=589.28s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, I believe it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=591.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=594.04s)]
*  So you're watching this just at home [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=594.88s)]
*  because you said you're not political. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=596.52s)]
*  Yeah, I'm watching this at home [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=598.04s)]
*  while I'm building the social investing app [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=599.16s)]
*  at the time was called Iris. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=602.2s)]
*  So that's what's funny about it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=603.4s)]
*  You know, we run the Pelosi tracker. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=605.76s)]
*  I'm not a political guy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=607.28s)]
*  I'm just an everyday dude. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=608.56s)]
*  You know, I'm 26, moved out to California [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=610.4s)]
*  to build this with my friends. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=613.3199999999999s)]
*  And then the politics stuff starts happening. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=615.5999999999999s)]
*  And like our mission with our app [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=618.1199999999999s)]
*  is to try and instill trust back into institutions. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=620.8s)]
*  And we always wanted to do that. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=624.0s)]
*  And our bigger picture was financial management [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=625.52s)]
*  and that whole, you know, space. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=628.16s)]
*  But then we started seeing the politics stuff. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=630.56s)]
*  It's like, this is incredible that they're able to do this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=632.2399999999999s)]
*  We have technology and we have the team [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=635.16s)]
*  that we can actually build a way for us [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=637.08s)]
*  to get involved with it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=639.24s)]
*  And what better way to highlight like the hypocrisy [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=640.84s)]
*  of politician stock trading than to build a way [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=643.08s)]
*  to actually copy them and invest alongside them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=645.12s)]
*  And that's how like how our app started. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=647.44s)]
*  But at the time, no, none of that was. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  And by the way, it's hilarious. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=652.64s)]
*  It's just hilarious. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=653.48s)]
*  It shouldn't be. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=654.6800000000001s)]
*  No, I know, I know. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=655.9200000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=657.24s)]
*  You have to laugh at tragedy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  I know, it's working. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=660.08s)]
*  Like I'll get into the whole thing about how like this, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=661.96s)]
*  Pelosi crushed it. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=665.0s)]
*  She was up 54% last year. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=665.8000000000001s)]
*  We got half a million half a billion dollars [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=667.88s)]
*  invested alongside her where the app is too popular. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=670.5600000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't be this popular with just like a slogan [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=674.32s)]
*  invest like a politician. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=676.88s)]
*  But I think it perfectly encompasses and showcases [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=678.12s)]
*  like the slogan of what's wrong with society right now. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=681.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not only do we not trust politicians, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=685.4000000000001s)]
*  we now are at the point where like throwing up our hands, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=688.44s)]
*  like fuck it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=690.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, if you guys aren't gonna ban it, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=691.64s)]
*  you're gonna keep doing it. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=693.24s)]
*  We're gonna build a way to get in on the action. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=694.16s)]
*  And what better way to do it [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=696.1999999999999s)]
*  and highlight the epoxy than copying them. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=697.48s)]
*  You're wrecking my day. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=699.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, again though, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=701.12s)]
*  if I can snap my fingers and have it just go away. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=703.6s)]
*  Of course, but you can't unfortunately. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=706.36s)]
*  So, okay. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=708.3199999999999s)]
*  So you see this and you decide [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=709.6s)]
*  that this is going on, that there's corruption, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=713.88s)]
*  that people, that politicians are supposed to be protecting [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=716.4s)]
*  and serving the country are actually using this information [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=719.04s)]
*  to their own advantage while the country rots. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=721.28s)]
*  How did you discover that Pelosi was a then speaker [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=725.8s)]
*  of the house was particularly successful? [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=730.28s)]
*  Yeah, Pelosi. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=733.68s)]
*  So Pelosi gets a lot of headlines for obvious reasons. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=734.52s)]
*  One, millions. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=737.48s)]
*  Massively outweighs what the other politicians are trading. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=743.0s)]
*  And I'm talking like she's trading 50 to 60 million [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=747.8399999999999s)]
*  while everyone else is trading smaller amounts. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=750.48s)]
*  When she got married, I think it was in 2012. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=752.5200000000001s)]
*  And there's a whole arc for her. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=756.8000000000001s)]
*  She got married in 2012 to Paul, Paul Pelosi, XVC. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=758.44s)]
*  No, no, she's been married to Paul Pelosi for decades. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=762.32s)]
*  Oh, has she? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=765.24s)]
*  Then, okay, then when they got married, I'm mixing up. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=766.08s)]
*  2012 is when the stock act started. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=769.5200000000001s)]
*  That's when they had to start showcasing it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=771.36s)]
*  When she got married to Paul though, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=774.5200000000001s)]
*  they were worth around 20 million, their net worth. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=775.6400000000001s)]
*  Their net worth now is around 260 million. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=777.84s)]
*  So you're 10Xing that, how? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=781.48s)]
*  She's been a career long politician, making 175K. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=783.5600000000001s)]
*  Her husband's very successful in stocks, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=787.1600000000001s)]
*  particularly tech stocks. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=790.84s)]
*  It all started with her in 2020 when she bought Tesla. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=794.08s)]
*  And this is when I personally started paying attention. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=799.2s)]
*  And then there's, you look back and it's like, holy shit, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=801.8000000000001s)]
*  this has been going on forever. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=804.36s)]
*  And that actually started back in with the Visa IPO. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=805.52s)]
*  So with the Visa IPO, she and her husband [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=809.48s)]
*  were able to get privileged ways to buy in on the IPO. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=813.76s)]
*  No one knows how, no one knows why. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=817.04s)]
*  And then the stock absolutely crushed it. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=818.84s)]
*  So that was brought up on a 60 minutes interview. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=820.64s)]
*  And that was that iconic interview [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=824.8s)]
*  from the reporter asking her like, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=827.76s)]
*  do you think this should be allowed? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=829.8s)]
*  Is this fine that you got in on the Visa? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=831.0s)]
*  And then, this is 10, 12 years ago, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=833.5999999999999s)]
*  nothing had necessarily happened. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=835.7199999999999s)]
*  Again, 2020 comes around COVID. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=838.0s)]
*  So people already necessarily know about her. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=840.5999999999999s)]
*  She now starts trading stocks again, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=843.0799999999999s)]
*  and it's getting blown up on social media [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=845.4s)]
*  because while everyone's with COVID, what are they doing? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=847.52s)]
*  They're on social media and they're trading stocks. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=849.8399999999999s)]
*  So now everyone's acutely watching these things [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  and paying attention. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=855.56s)]
*  She in end of 2020, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=856.7199999999999s)]
*  right after Biden got elected, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=861.34s)]
*  she went and bought up to $5 million of Tesla calls. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=863.38s)]
*  And I can go on forever about the details of these things. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=867.02s)]
*  She's not just buying stock. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=870.34s)]
*  Well, her husband's not just buying. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=872.18s)]
*  She's buying these things called leaps. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=873.58s)]
*  And what a leap is, is a options contract [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=875.3s)]
*  that allows you to buy a stock and be bullish on a stock [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=878.46s)]
*  at a much cheaper cost basis. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=881.9s)]
*  So instead of you needing $5 million to buy, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=884.62s)]
*  X amount of quote unquote risk in a stock for it to go up, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=888.02s)]
*  you can actually take that $5 million and buy a leap [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=891.02s)]
*  and it gives you a broader Delta [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=893.98s)]
*  so that you can make more money. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=896.02s)]
*  It's essentially higher risk, high reward. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=897.34s)]
*  So she goes and she's buying these leaps. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=899.5s)]
*  She's not just buying the stocks in them. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=901.54s)]
*  She buys leaps in Tesla at the end of 2020, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=903.66s)]
*  right after Biden got elected. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=908.38s)]
*  2021 comes around, or excuse me, 2019 into 2020, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=909.9s)]
*  because that was when Biden started trading. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=913.9s)]
*  2019 into 2020, because that was when Biden started. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=915.8199999999999s)]
*  There's so many dates. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=918.5s)]
*  But when Biden's first few weeks in office, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=919.5s)]
*  he introduces the Build Back Better 1.3, 2.3, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=923.22s)]
*  three, whatever massive infrastructure bill. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=927.4599999999999s)]
*  Do you remember that one? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=930.02s)]
*  Very well. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=930.86s)]
*  Part of that bill had tons of not only subsidies [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=931.6999999999999s)]
*  for the electric vehicle industry, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=934.5799999999999s)]
*  but also money to build out and invest [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=936.78s)]
*  for the charging ports for electric vehicles. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=939.98s)]
*  Because you can't just tell people to go buy electric cars. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=942.38s)]
*  You need to have the infrastructure, yeah. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=945.38s)]
*  So when you start following the timeline on it, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=947.74s)]
*  it's like, okay, Biden gets elected. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=949.62s)]
*  She buys up to $5 million of leaps, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=952.26s)]
*  which are very risky in Tesla. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=955.18s)]
*  That agenda then comes out. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=957.66s)]
*  The stock flies 50%. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=960.38s)]
*  So it's not like she's actually buying things [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=963.5799999999999s)]
*  that the public wouldn't necessarily know about, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=967.5799999999999s)]
*  but she's buying things in a high risky way [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=969.78s)]
*  with a ton of money in ways that the public now [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=972.5s)]
*  is paying attention to because everyone's trading stocks [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=976.02s)]
*  and they're watching Tesla, Elon. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=979.14s)]
*  That was when the thing started blowing up. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=980.62s)]
*  And that was the first trade that probably, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=982.34s)]
*  I think, re-triggered everyone's mind into like, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=984.22s)]
*  wait a second, this may not be the sketchiest trade [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=987.62s)]
*  in the world because those things were still public, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=990.5s)]
*  but how are they allowed to necessarily do that? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=992.94s)]
*  How is Pelosi the third most powerful person in America, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=995.38s)]
*  president, VP, the house, the head speaker. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=999.78s)]
*  They shouldn't be allowed to trade stocks. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1005.38s)]
*  How is this even, like, how are we allowing that? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1008.22s)]
*  And I think like the culmination [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1010.9399999999999s)]
*  of those different intersections is why this started [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1012.42s)]
*  getting big and why people started paying attention, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1014.9s)]
*  specifically to Pelosi. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1017.8199999999999s)]
*  How did she do on those leaps with Tesla? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1019.1s)]
*  So she was up around 50% and then she sold a little bit [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1021.3399999999999s)]
*  and then it came back down [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1026.3799999999999s)]
*  and then she actually just sold those shares [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1027.82s)]
*  because the way that a leap works is [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1030.06s)]
*  if you're buying a contract and that gives you the ability [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1031.74s)]
*  to buy a hundred shares of that underlying stock, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1034.98s)]
*  it's pretty complex-ish. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1038.58s)]
*  But so when she bought the leaps a year later, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1041.1399999999999s)]
*  she exercises the right to buy those shares. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1044.4199999999998s)]
*  So now she has, I think it was around like 5,000 shares [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1046.82s)]
*  of Tesla and she's held those all up [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1050.1799999999998s)]
*  until July of 2024, this year actually. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1052.86s)]
*  And she sold them too early. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1056.38s)]
*  She sold them before Trump got reelected [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1058.5800000000002s)]
*  and the things started flying. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1060.98s)]
*  But I think she was up around 40 to 50% in total [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1062.3000000000002s)]
*  from that Tesla trade. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1067.38s)]
*  Her best ones are Nvidia. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1068.74s)]
*  Nvidia is a whole nother story for her. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1070.2600000000002s)]
*  But on that Tesla one in particular, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1072.6200000000001s)]
*  I think it was like 40 to 50. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1074.0200000000002s)]
*  When you sleep better, you live better, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1075.38s)]
*  you feel better and you live longer. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1077.0600000000002s)]
*  Sleep is really important, [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1078.8600000000001s)]
*  but there's a lot acting against us [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1079.8600000000001s)]
*  who are trying to get a good sleep, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1082.7s)]
*  starting with screen time. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1083.94s)]
*  It scrambles your brain, makes it hard to sleep. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1085.8600000000001s)]
*  So we're thinking a lot about sleep, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1088.3400000000001s)]
*  not getting as much as we should. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1089.54s)]
*  So a new partner we wanna tell you about can help you. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1090.66s)]
*  It's called Beams Dream Powder [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1093.3400000000001s)]
*  and it's made with a blend of all natural ingredients. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1095.18s)]
*  It's not made by Pfizer. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1097.54s)]
*  It's science-backed, it's American built and run [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1099.02s)]
*  and best of all, it legitimately tastes good. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1101.66s)]
*  It can help you fall asleep, stay asleep [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1103.74s)]
*  and wake up feeling amazing. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1105.3400000000001s)]

*  Awesome. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1145.8200000000002s)]
*  What has she done on Nvidia? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1146.66s)]
*  So Nvidia is the second trade that got the masses attention. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1148.18s)]
*  For people to know, tell us what Nvidia is. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1152.14s)]
*  Nvidia is a semiconductor. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1153.94s)]
*  They're essentially the most popular stock [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1155.3000000000002s)]
*  and the best company. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1157.7800000000002s)]
*  I think they're worth more than Apple now. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1158.9s)]
*  They're the most valuable company in the world. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1160.9s)]
*  They sell the chips for semis [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1163.18s)]
*  and like they have a whole broader thing beyond just that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1165.26s)]
*  but essentially they're a semiconductor company. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1167.38s)]
*  They buy and sell chips. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1169.5s)]
*  So in 2022, that's when the Chips Act, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1171.6599999999999s)]
*  if you remember this $54 billion chips bill [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1175.02s)]
*  that Biden and Pelosi pushed, she bought, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1178.6999999999998s)]
*  and this is where social media, again, why it's powerful [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1181.9799999999998s)]
*  and the pressure started billing up to her at this point [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1184.5s)]
*  because people were following the trades. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1187.1s)]
*  The markets were crashing it. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1188.9399999999998s)]
*  She was crushing it in 2021. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1190.26s)]
*  When 2022 came around, the Chips Act comes out, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1193.5s)]
*  $54 billion of infrastructure for chips [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1196.3799999999999s)]
*  and subsidies for them. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1199.58s)]
*  She bought Nvidia, I think a couple months before that. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1200.98s)]
*  Oh, come on. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1204.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1204.8600000000001s)]
*  The problem with her is every trade is suspicious. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1206.98s)]
*  There's never a trade that you just are like, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1210.18s)]
*  okay, I could not and I'll get into them without, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1211.98s)]
*  there's a couple more I can get to, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1215.34s)]
*  but with that Nvidia trade in particular, she bought it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1216.74s)]
*  The Chips Act comes out. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1219.78s)]
*  We start making TikToks. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1220.94s)]
*  We start tweeting about it. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1222.22s)]
*  And then everyone's like, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1223.82s)]
*  what the fuck, what's going on with that? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1224.66s)]
*  She then sells it for a loss [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1226.58s)]
*  because the stock was already coming down. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1229.86s)]
*  This was when the market started falling. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1232.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1234.1799999999998s)]
*  And she ended up selling it for a $300,000 loss. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1235.02s)]
*  She sold it all. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1237.3799999999999s)]
*  Cause I think the public was starting to be like, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1238.5s)]
*  what the fuck? [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1240.26s)]
*  How are you doing this when we're already calling you out [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1241.9799999999998s)]
*  and you're still continuing to do it? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1244.3s)]
*  She sold those things for a 300K loss [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1246.3s)]
*  and then she sold her shares for a 200K loss. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1248.78s)]
*  So she lost money on that first Nvidia time. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1251.54s)]
*  But the interesting thing about that is per these filings [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1253.8999999999999s)]
*  the way that the filings work is [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1259.06s)]
*  the Stock Act requires politicians to disclose them, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1260.6999999999998s)]
*  their spouses and their dependents of any trade [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1264.6599999999999s)]
*  up to 45 days. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1267.34s)]
*  On that trade in particular is the only time [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1269.3799999999999s)]
*  she's ever publicly said her profit and loss. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1271.9399999999998s)]
*  So never before, never since then, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1274.9399999999998s)]
*  only in that filing was when she said, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1277.8999999999999s)]
*  hey everyone, I lost 250K in Nvidia, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1279.78s)]
*  get off my back kind of thing. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1283.6599999999999s)]
*  She's never done that for when she's profited. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1284.86s)]
*  She's only done it when she's lost. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1287.26s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1290.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1290.94s)]
*  There's so many things with her. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1292.26s)]
*  The filings she sends out are always before holidays. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1293.94s)]
*  So she's notorious in our community for releasing reports [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1298.9s)]
*  around Thanksgiving, July 4th, Christmas. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1303.42s)]
*  And I think the argument is cause like, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1308.54s)]
*  if you put it on December 23rd, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1310.46s)]
*  everyone's going off to vacation. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1312.14s)]
*  Of course. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1313.5s)]
*  Yeah, it gets lost. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1314.34s)]
*  Gets lost in the media. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1315.82s)]
*  And then she drops bad news on Fridays. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1317.3799999999999s)]
*  That's the rule. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1318.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1319.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1319.8999999999999s)]
*  This year she dropped it on July 4th. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1320.74s)]
*  That was when she dropped all of these previous trades. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1321.8999999999999s)]
*  Happy birthday America. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1323.78s)]
*  I know, yeah. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1324.62s)]
*  So that Nvidia trade goes on, she loses money. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1326.86s)]
*  The whole market was doing bad in that year. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1329.74s)]
*  So she didn't do too well in that, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1331.8999999999999s)]
*  I think it was 2022. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1336.3s)]
*  2023 comes around, the market starts going up again. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1339.46s)]
*  And we have all this information, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1342.22s)]
*  which I could probably get to, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1343.6599999999999s)]
*  but she then re-buys into Nvidia at the end of 2022, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1345.22s)]
*  or at the end of 2023, excuse me, in November. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1352.38s)]
*  She goes and buys $5 million worth of leaps again. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1355.1000000000001s)]
*  Those leaps then right after she buys, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1358.5s)]
*  there's no laws or anything that comes up after that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1361.8600000000001s)]
*  It just turns out to be a tremendously well-timed trade [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1366.42s)]
*  because from there Nvidia goes up 160, 170%. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1369.1000000000001s)]
*  And on that trade in particular, [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1373.46s)]
*  she then bought a little bit more. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1375.6999999999998s)]
*  That $5 million, and the ranges are hard [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1377.34s)]
*  because the way that these filings work is they have [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1381.34s)]
*  to file from 1K to 15K is one little check. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1384.1s)]
*  15K to 50K, 50K to 100K, 100K to 250K, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1388.86s)]
*  250K to 500K, 500K up. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1394.1799999999998s)]
*  So we're going off of the ranges. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1397.26s)]
*  So you don't know the exact amount that she's buying, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1398.82s)]
*  but that Nvidia trade is the best trade she's ever made [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1402.34s)]
*  that we followed in recent memory. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1405.02s)]
*  And she's up around like 140% on that trade in particular. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1407.6599999999999s)]
*  And like, this is millions. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1411.78s)]
*  It's not like it's, you know, 50K. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1413.74s)]
*  It's up to $5 million. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1417.3799999999999s)]
*  That $5 million could be worth 7.5 million now. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1419.4199999999998s)]
*  And she's just quiet about it. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1423.3s)]
*  Doesn't say anything when we call her out. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1425.86s)]
*  How long have you been doing this? [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1428.02s)]
*  We've been doing it since 2022. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1429.54s)]
*  So we've tracked her in particular. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1431.58s)]
*  And let me be clear, it's not just her. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1433.42s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1434.74s)]
*  I've got a bunch of questions for you. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1435.58s)]
*  Crenshaw and them, but yeah, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1437.18s)]
*  we've been tracking her since 2021. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1438.86s)]
*  You know, you look at, if I looked at the Congress, [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1441.06s)]
*  who were the filthiest members of Congress? [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1442.86s)]
*  Well, Dan Crenshaw would be right at the top with Pelosi. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1444.3s)]
*  And it's not surprising that they're- [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1447.6599999999999s)]
*  No, and he is interesting because- [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1449.82s)]
*  Hold on, before we get to that, he's his whole thing. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1453.78s)]
*  But I just want to close out Pelosi for a sec. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1456.7s)]
*  So you've been doing this for two and a half, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1458.62s)]
*  three years on Pelosi. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1460.54s)]
*  Yep. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1461.78s)]
*  And gotten, you said you've never done an interview before, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1462.62s)]
*  which is very weird. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1465.78s)]
*  No, no. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1466.62s)]
*  But a lot of people I know read you a lot. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1467.46s)]
*  So she's gotten a lot of scrutiny [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1471.1399999999999s)]
*  because of what you've done. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1472.62s)]
*  Has her office ever reached out to you in any way? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1473.82s)]
*  No, the office has never reached out. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1475.62s)]
*  And again, like the crazy thing about this stuff is, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1477.78s)]
*  we took this whole thing a step further [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1482.54s)]
*  by building our app, Autopilot. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1484.3799999999999s)]
*  And Autopilot, the way that it works is, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1486.86s)]
*  you literally can go and invest [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1488.74s)]
*  alongside these politicians. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1490.14s)]
*  So it's one thing to be like, [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1491.82s)]
*  oh, fuck you, Pelosi, you're trading in front of us. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1493.54s)]
*  And then it's like, oh, wait a second, you're crushing it. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1496.58s)]
*  Like, whoa. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1499.42s)]
*  And now it's like, and now I can invest alongside them [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1500.42s)]
*  so I can get in on the action. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1504.5s)]
*  And I think allowing people to get their money in [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1506.18s)]
*  makes the whole thing kind of just more hypocritical [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1509.38s)]
*  and funnier. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1511.42s)]
*  So Pelosi, since we've been tracking her, is up 87%. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1512.26s)]
*  That's from, I think around May of 2021. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1515.94s)]
*  Outperforming the spy by 50%. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1518.78s)]
*  In that time period, since we've been doing this thing, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1521.8600000000001s)]
*  we now have $300 million [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1524.7s)]
*  literally investing alongside her. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1526.54s)]
*  People have profited $30 million trading, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1528.5s)]
*  doing whatever she does in that time period, give or take. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1531.38s)]
*  And her office has never reached out. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1535.3400000000001s)]
*  She's gone on, been questioned in the press conferences [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1538.02s)]
*  being like, do you think you and members of Congress [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1541.74s)]
*  should be allowed to trade stock? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1544.38s)]
*  And she's like, yeah, well, it's a free economy. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1546.06s)]
*  Like if it's a free market, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1548.34s)]
*  we as citizens should be able to trade. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1549.9s)]
*  But of course it's not a free market. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1551.82s)]
*  And her example shows you what a rigged market it is. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1553.18s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1556.22s)]
*  I mean, she's, so yeah, she's benefiting from information [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1557.06s)]
*  that she has because of her position. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1560.26s)]
*  She's not allowed to do that. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1561.82s)]
*  She does it anyway. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1562.66s)]
*  It's a crime. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1563.5s)]
*  She should be prosecuted. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1564.32s)]
*  It's certainly a moral crime. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1565.98s)]
*  So give us some perspective. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1568.18s)]
*  So she's up this fantastic number [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1570.3s)]
*  relative to like average investors, informed investors, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1574.14s)]
*  like how well has she done? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1577.8200000000002s)]
*  Yep. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1579.0200000000002s)]
*  So last year in particular, and this is probably we, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1579.94s)]
*  and let me be clear. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1583.26s)]
*  So we're not tracking, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1584.1000000000001s)]
*  since it's hard to know the exact amount [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1585.6200000000001s)]
*  and it's hard to track her actual trades. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1587.94s)]
*  So what we track is the filings of it. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1590.66s)]
*  And they're roughly the same [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1592.9s)]
*  because they don't get displayed or filed too long after. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1594.14s)]
*  So in 2024, for example, she was up 54%. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1599.3400000000001s)]
*  The market was up around, I think like 26 or 27. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1603.18s)]
*  So she personally outperformed the stock market, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1605.98s)]
*  the broader S&P by 20%, 25%. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1609.94s)]
*  We also have these other trackers that track the hedge funds. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1614.1000000000001s)]
*  And there was a report from Bloomberg [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1618.22s)]
*  where she actually outperformed, I think like 95% [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1620.26s)]
*  of professional hedge fund managers. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1623.78s)]
*  And when you take a step, it's like, what is good? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1625.5s)]
*  The politicians, Unusual Wells has a report in 2024 [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1630.5s)]
*  and she was only the seventh best trader. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1634.46s)]
*  There were traders that were better than her. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1636.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, the funny thing, I was talking about this yesterday [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1638.3s)]
*  with a buddy of mine who's in business, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1639.86s)]
*  but you often see retired politicians decide [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1641.06s)]
*  they're gonna go get rich in business, in finance usually, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1643.18s)]
*  but in some form of PE or whatever [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1646.34s)]
*  that they think they're gonna be, and they are all terrible. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1649.94s)]
*  Like there's not been, we're talking about Pompeo [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1652.58s)]
*  thinks he's gonna get rich with Pompeo. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1654.3s)]
*  And like, no one wants Pompeo, [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1655.78s)]
*  cause he's like an idiot, isn't, this is not his area. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1656.66s)]
*  Well, I should say he's not, he's smart, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1659.6599999999999s)]
*  but he's not a business guy. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1662.1799999999998s)]
*  And politics and business are very different. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1664.22s)]
*  So it's especially striking to see, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1665.62s)]
*  this is the only way politicians can make money [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1669.34s)]
*  is through insider trading. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1671.3s)]
*  I know. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1673.06s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1673.8999999999999s)]
*  Pretty much, yeah, it's that or books. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1674.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1676.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a book and honestly, Netflix specials now, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1678.1s)]
*  yeah, the Clintons with all that stuff. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1681.06s)]
*  But she again is extreme cause you just trade so much. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1683.34s)]
*  The other politicians, they're trading on lower levels. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1687.02s)]
*  But I think like the bigger thing that we're trying to do [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1690.3799999999999s)]
*  with all this stuff is like, we don't want them trading. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1693.58s)]
*  Again, like we think that it's messed up. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1695.94s)]
*  It creates distrust in the politicians. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1698.66s)]
*  Of course. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1700.74s)]
*  It's not like we don't, me personally, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1701.58s)]
*  it's not like I am saying, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1703.58s)]
*  hey, you guys can't do that cause you're getting rich. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1706.62s)]
*  Like obviously that's a piece of it, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1709.1s)]
*  but it's more of like, hey, you guys can't do that [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1710.66s)]
*  because the average American can't do that. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1713.1399999999999s)]
*  And we're all just looking at you guys. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1715.22s)]
*  Well, it also influences their policymaking behavior. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1716.98s)]
*  I mean, of course it sets up incentives [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1720.26s)]
*  that you don't wanna have [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1722.82s)]
*  in your legislative branch at all. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1723.82s)]
*  Yeah, and you know the saying, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1725.74s)]
*  like show me the incentive, I'll show you the reward. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1727.34s)]
*  It's like, the war ones are crazy too. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1730.06s)]
*  Like there's so much that you can get into. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1734.9s)]
*  I have trouble laughing at that. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1738.02s)]
*  That actually makes me feel like these people [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1739.9s)]
*  are going to hell. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1741.42s)]
*  But I wanna ask about that in two seconds. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1742.82s)]
*  But first you said she's the seventh most successful [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1744.66s)]
*  congressional trader, who are the others? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1748.26s)]
*  In 2024. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1749.46s)]
*  So the other ones off the top, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1750.3000000000002s)]
*  and this is all unusual on Unusual Wails' Twitter. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1752.5s)]
*  We work with them. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1755.18s)]
*  He actually took some of the portfolios [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1756.02s)]
*  and he put them on our app. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1757.8600000000001s)]
*  So now people can go in and they can trade alongside [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1758.8200000000002s)]
*  not just Pelosi, but other ones too. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1761.46s)]
*  David Rauser was the top one. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1764.22s)]
*  And I think he made a lot of money in Nvidia. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1766.14s)]
*  He also owns some other smaller ETFs. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1769.66s)]
*  So he doesn't trade that much. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1771.78s)]
*  These are stocks that he's owned for a while. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1774.5800000000002s)]
*  Debbie Wasserman Schultz, she's now a two time, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1777.42s)]
*  top five political stock trader. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1780.94s)]
*  Speaking of filthy. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1784.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1785.5400000000002s)]
*  So we run the Pelosi tracker [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1788.74s)]
*  and we also have a politician trade tracker [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1790.0600000000002s)]
*  on Instagram and TikTok that each have 800,000. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1791.98s)]
*  On TikTok we have around 100,000 followers. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1795.8200000000002s)]
*  People don't like that woman. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1798.74s)]
*  Well, nobody likes her. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1800.9s)]
*  She was bounced out of a leadership position [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1802.38s)]
*  in the Democratic party [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1804.46s)]
*  because people disliked her so much personally. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1805.3000000000002s)]
*  And she honestly is one of the five or six [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1807.7800000000002s)]
*  that I personally track, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1810.66s)]
*  that I know a decent amount about [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1812.18s)]
*  because of how many times she has conflicts of interest, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1813.46s)]
*  what she trades. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1816.6200000000001s)]
*  For example, she bought this company called Viasat. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1818.1000000000001s)]
*  And what Viasat does is they're a military contractor. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1820.74s)]
*  They're like a Starlink, like Elon's thing, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1824.5800000000002s)]
*  but they do the communications for the military. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1827.46s)]
*  They get hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1829.94s)]
*  from this or that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1832.5s)]
*  She sits on the committee [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1834.3400000000001s)]
*  that oversees military construction. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1837.38s)]
*  And it's like, I'm watching you trade this stock, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1839.78s)]
*  even aside from performance, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1843.94s)]
*  I'm watching you buy and sell a military construction company [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1845.26s)]
*  while sitting on a committee [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1849.8600000000001s)]
*  that oversees military construction. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1851.06s)]
*  How is that allowed? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1852.98s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1854.5s)]
*  Another one was she bought a mining company [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1855.6200000000001s)]
*  called Helca Mining with ticker symbol HL. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1857.66s)]
*  That stock has been fluctuating here and there. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1860.74s)]
*  And I think she is up around 15% on it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1863.78s)]
*  She sits on the energy, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1867.14s)]
*  one of the energy resources committees. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1868.9s)]
*  And it's like, what are we doing? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1871.18s)]
*  How do they allow it? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1874.62s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1875.7s)]
*  We're watching corruption happen [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1876.74s)]
*  and it's destroying any confidence [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1878.7s)]
*  people have in their government. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1881.58s)]
*  It's priming the country for some kind of revolution, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1882.66s)]
*  hopefully a peaceful one, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1885.78s)]
*  but a revolution anyway, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1886.82s)]
*  this can't continue in a democracy. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1888.1s)]
*  So tell us about my all time favorite member [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1890.98s)]
*  of Congress, Dan Crenshaw. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1896.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1897.3s)]
*  So he's a tough one. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1898.1399999999999s)]
*  He's a hot head on Twitter now. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1900.9399999999998s)]
*  He's out of control. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1903.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I don't understand why he's taken this stance [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1904.02s)]
*  a little bit. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1906.82s)]
*  Because I think his personal life is out of control. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, because he used to be like a right wing darling. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1909.62s)]
*  Like he was, you know, with the Navy SEALs, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1912.46s)]
*  I think early, early on. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1914.46s)]
*  Not with me, I always thought he was a freak [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1916.22s)]
*  and a warmonger weirdo. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1918.02s)]
*  Yeah, he's a freak and a warmonger weirdo. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1919.74s)]
*  He's showing it now. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1921.98s)]
*  Did you see the free press? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1923.6200000000001s)]
*  He did where we posted this. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1924.9s)]
*  He essentially comes out and he's like [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1927.38s)]
*  supporting politicals, politician stock trading. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1929.8200000000002s)]
*  He's like, if you get rid of it, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1932.98s)]
*  you're gonna get crappy politicians. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1934.26s)]
*  And it's like, what are you talking about? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1936.78s)]
*  You know, like we're not asking you guys to crack it. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1938.94s)]
*  That's like saying, if you don't allow the police [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1941.42s)]
*  to shake down speeders at gunpoint, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1944.18s)]
*  you're gonna get a worst kind of cop. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1946.26s)]
*  Exactly, yeah. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1947.74s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1949.1000000000001s)]
*  It's, yeah, so he had a fiery one with the free press, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1949.94s)]
*  probably about like two months ago, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1954.8200000000002s)]
*  right before Thanksgiving. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1956.3400000000001s)]
*  I saw that. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1957.18s)]
*  His portfolio though, in particular, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1958.42s)]
*  he's up around like 48 to 50%. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1960.22s)]
*  And all of this, you know, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1962.6200000000001s)]
*  I gotta say this for compliance reasons, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1964.02s)]
*  like you can see all this on our app, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1965.26s)]
*  you know, it's all right there. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1966.74s)]
*  So I may kind of be, depending on the day, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1967.8200000000002s)]
*  but he outperformed the market. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1970.66s)]
*  He was right below Pelosi. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1972.1000000000001s)]
*  But he's an idiot though. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1974.7s)]
*  I mean, with no business background that I'm aware of. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1975.98s)]
*  So like, how would you do that? [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1978.42s)]
*  His stocks, the one that in particular [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1980.14s)]
*  that really frustrated me about him was Metta. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1982.42s)]
*  So he, the stocks that he's buying is, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1986.46s)]
*  his portfolio is comprised of Metta, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1988.8200000000002s)]
*  which he's crushing it up like 200%. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1990.54s)]
*  He bought the dip perfectly back in 2022, I believe, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1992.8600000000001s)]
*  like pretty much perfectly. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1995.8200000000002s)]
*  The things started flying. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=1997.5800000000002s)]
*  He bought Amazon, he bought FAS, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2000.14s)]
*  which is like a finance ETF. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2003.06s)]
*  He bought the spy and then he bought Wynn Resorts, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2006.34s)]
*  and then he bought some other company. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2008.7s)]
*  The stock though that crushed it for him was Metta. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2010.3799999999999s)]
*  And the part that I get annoyed about, you know, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2015.06s)]
*  aside from TikTok bans, this and that, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2017.94s)]
*  you can't, he buys the stock, a couple months later, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2020.3799999999999s)]
*  starts pushing and publicly vocalizing like, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2025.5s)]
*  hey everyone, we should ban TikTok, you know? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2027.86s)]
*  And it's like pretty convenient to say [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2030.78s)]
*  when you own TikTok's main competitor, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2033.18s)]
*  and every time you're saying that, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2036.38s)]
*  the stock's going up 5%. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2037.78s)]
*  He then goes off and starts asking for the ban on, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2040.5800000000002s)]
*  and again, like I feel like I'm pretty pro ban TikTok, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2043.74s)]
*  so there's a whole world with that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2046.8600000000001s)]
*  But he then goes off and votes against the bill [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2049.06s)]
*  to ban TikTok. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2052.26s)]
*  So now you got a politician [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2053.3s)]
*  that is buying TikTok's main competitor Metta. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2054.62s)]
*  You're then publicly talking about [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2057.98s)]
*  how you want to ban it from government officials' phones [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2060.1s)]
*  to then voting on the bill to ban TikTok [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2064.38s)]
*  all while the stock has gone up 200% while you've owned it. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2067.18s)]
*  This is like, you're shocking me. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2072.22s)]
*  I'm numb to it. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2075.1s)]
*  And when he gets called out on it, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2075.94s)]
*  and this is one of the reasons I dislike him, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2078.66s)]
*  and I do think that there's a lot wrong with him personally, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2080.58s)]
*  so I do feel sorry for him, a lot wrong. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2084.22s)]
*  I mean, I know that. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2086.66s)]
*  But anyway, leaving that aside, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2087.5s)]
*  the reason I don't like him is because he's self-righteous. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2089.3s)]
*  If I catch you shoplifting, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2093.5800000000004s)]
*  and then you punch me in the face [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2094.98s)]
*  and scream how you're being victimized, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2096.1400000000003s)]
*  I can't deal with that. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2097.6200000000003s)]
*  Just admit you're shoplifting. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2098.54s)]
*  Say sorry, and I'll prove you and move on, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2099.94s)]
*  but don't yell at me. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2102.0600000000004s)]
*  Or even just help the conversation. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2103.7000000000003s)]
*  Be like, yeah, I mean, if you guys are allowing us, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2105.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll vote on it, this and that, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2108.54s)]
*  just be open and be transparent about it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2110.6600000000003s)]
*  You don't have to attack and gaslight the American people. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2112.78s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2115.9s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2117.1000000000004s)]
*  And boy, is he a specialist in that area. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2118.14s)]
*  Yeah, the Free Press one, I'll send it to you after. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2120.18s)]
*  I've seen it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2123.38s)]
*  Yeah, that one gets my blood boiling, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2124.22s)]
*  because it's like, what frustrates me about this stuff [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2127.2999999999997s)]
*  is you can't sit on the committee, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2130.42s)]
*  you can't be voting on these things, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2132.14s)]
*  you can't be doing all this stuff [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2133.54s)]
*  in front of the American public. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2135.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, I have a friend that is a consultant [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2136.7s)]
*  at EY or Deloitte, he can't trade individual stocks. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2140.2599999999998s)]
*  I got friends in banking [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2145.2599999999998s)]
*  that can't trade individual stocks. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2146.42s)]
*  It's like, why can you not let the low level analysts, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2148.1s)]
*  the JP Morgan buy Apple? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2151.7000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, you got these politicians buying up [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2155.5s)]
*  this $500 million military construction company [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2158.38s)]
*  all right in front of us. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2162.06s)]
*  I know the answer, you wanna hear the answer? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2162.9s)]
*  Because after the financial crisis [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2164.34s)]
*  that Congress helped cause, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2166.1800000000003s)]
*  Congress runs in with Dodd-Frank, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2169.86s)]
*  Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2173.66s)]
*  remember the Senate, remember the House, both Democrats, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2174.94s)]
*  and they come up with all these regulations [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2176.66s)]
*  that are supposedly gonna protect America [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2178.94s)]
*  from future disasters of this kind, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2180.78s)]
*  and they pass these so-called reforms, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2183.06s)]
*  destroy the banking sector, really, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2187.38s)]
*  don't make it less corrupt, just wreck it, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2189.1s)]
*  take all the innovation out of it, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2191.98s)]
*  and then they don't apply those same standards themselves. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2193.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2196.58s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of the short- [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2197.42s)]
*  Rules for the, not for me. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2198.2400000000002s)]
*  Is that a fair- [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2199.08s)]
*  Yeah, 100%. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2199.9s)]
*  The history of the Stock Act that started [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2202.26s)]
*  because of the housing crisis. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2204.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2206.3s)]
*  So it was initially introduced in 2006, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2207.14s)]
*  and the Stock Act literally, what it says is, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2209.5s)]
*  stop, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2213.08s)]
*  ST, whatever, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2214.98s)]
*  stop trading on congressional knowledge. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2216.46s)]
*  That's what it means. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2219.2599999999998s)]
*  So if you have a bill that literally says, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2220.58s)]
*  stop trading on congressional knowledge [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2222.42s)]
*  as the name of the act, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2224.62s)]
*  you know that there's something already sketchy going on, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2226.86s)]
*  and why was that not a thing to begin with? [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2229.06s)]
*  And so what happened to it? [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2231.54s)]
*  So in 2006, it got introduced. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2232.94s)]
*  No politicians cared about it. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2234.9s)]
*  You know, whatever. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2236.62s)]
*  After the housing crisis, they found out, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2238.1800000000003s)]
*  and they realized that there were around 33 politicians [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2240.46s)]
*  that set their portfolios up [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2243.62s)]
*  after talking with the officials at the Fed, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2245.42s)]
*  and you know, the people melding out the monetary policy. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2247.92s)]
*  They reconstructed their portfolios [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2250.46s)]
*  while that whole crisis was going on. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2252.5s)]
*  They didn't have to display or publicly talk about it [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2254.7000000000003s)]
*  because the Stock Act wasn't announced. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2256.9s)]
*  All that stuff came out after that, like, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2258.8s)]
*  while the housing market is crashing [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2260.98s)]
*  and Americans are losing their homes left and right, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2262.98s)]
*  these politicians are moving millions, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2265.2599999999998s)]
*  reconstructing their portfolios [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2267.3799999999997s)]
*  after getting out of the meetings with the Fed officials. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2269.54s)]
*  So that's how it came back onto the center stage. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2272.18s)]
*  The Stock Act then gets introduced in 2012, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2275.7999999999997s)]
*  and then it gets passed shortly after that. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2278.5s)]
*  What is crazy in my head though, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2281.3399999999997s)]
*  is like, what the heck was going on before it? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2283.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2285.98s)]
*  Like, what do we, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2286.8199999999997s)]
*  that I think was, we were talking off camera, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2288.02s)]
*  our generation, we grow up with it and we're used to it. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2289.8799999999997s)]
*  Now, because of things like that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2292.64s)]
*  It's like, how can they have not had any limitations [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2295.48s)]
*  before 2012? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2299.8399999999997s)]
*  What were they doing? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2300.96s)]
*  You know, I can't answer your question. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2302.3199999999997s)]
*  Clearly it's been very corrupt for a long time. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2305.96s)]
*  Well, they murdered the president of the United States [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2308.04s)]
*  in 1963 and no one was ever held accountable for it. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2310.64s)]
*  So, you know, looking back, you can say, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2313.44s)]
*  boy, we've had big problems for a long time, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2315.68s)]
*  but I can tell you, someone who grew up [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2317.9199999999996s)]
*  right in the middle of it in DC, in Georgetown, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2319.44s)]
*  all this stuff was going on. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2322.12s)]
*  Like when that COVID, those COVID trades, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2323.04s)]
*  you've started our conversation by describing, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2328.36s)]
*  Kelly Woffler was involved in that and all this stuff. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2330.42s)]
*  I was like, part of me, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2333.3199999999997s)]
*  I think I was the only person at Fox News [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2334.7999999999997s)]
*  who did anything on it, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2336.36s)]
*  because it's a great story. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2337.2s)]
*  But even as I was doing the story, I was like, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2339.2s)]
*  there's gotta be another explanation. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2341.4s)]
*  This can't be real. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2342.64s)]
*  Trading on a pandemic? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2344.24s)]
*  Insider trading on a pandemic. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2346.36s)]
*  I was like, you have to be a monster to do that. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2348.2799999999997s)]
*  This can't actually have happened. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2350.3199999999997s)]
*  That was me with the Pelosi tracker [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2352.04s)]
*  every day in the early days. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2355.3599999999997s)]
*  I remember a couple of these trades, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2356.6s)]
*  and there's so many now, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2360.04s)]
*  but I remember calling my dad up and I'm like, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2361.4s)]
*  wait a second, is this actually, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2364.8399999999997s)]
*  are they actually trading? [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2366.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not just Mike McCall. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2368.04s)]
*  I can't remember the specific trades. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2370.08s)]
*  I think it was him, but. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2371.8399999999997s)]
*  No one, here I'm talking about poor Dan Crenshaw, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2372.96s)]
*  who was just like totally unbalanced. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2376.44s)]
*  That won't end well, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2378.52s)]
*  but Mike McCall is like, now we're getting really sinister. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2379.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2382.44s)]
*  He, I'm trying to remember the trades, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2383.28s)]
*  because he sits on the, [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2385.08s)]
*  he sits on a lot of the intelligence committees, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2387.04s)]
*  or not the intelligence, a lot of the big committees, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2388.96s)]
*  and he's trading millions, but it's not just. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2391.84s)]
*  Mike McCall? [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2394.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so, I think so. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2394.84s)]
*  He's in particular, because he's really hard to track. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2396.52s)]
*  We know this in the world of the us, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2398.7200000000003s)]
*  quiver quant, usual whales, we're the ones that do this. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2401.32s)]
*  He manually fills out the filings by hand. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2403.72s)]
*  So his trades don't get picked up. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2407.3199999999997s)]
*  No way. By the majority of, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2410.04s)]
*  I'm 99% sure, I can confirm that, but yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2411.68s)]
*  He, and his trades, I think are weird, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2414.16s)]
*  because it's him, it's the dependent and the spouse. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2418.4399999999996s)]
*  The trades, they come in kind of as the same. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2423.14s)]
*  So there's an argument that maybe Mike McCall's trades [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2425.58s)]
*  are from a financial advisor, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2428.64s)]
*  but if he can tell us, we tag him on Twitter. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2432.84s)]
*  It's like, you guys can just tell us what's going on. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2437.6000000000004s)]
*  He doesn't care. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2439.48s)]
*  A couple of years ago, somebody said, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2440.32s)]
*  I was talking to Mike McCall, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2442.08s)]
*  and he described you as a Russian agent. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2443.08s)]
*  Really? Oh, so he's one of these guys. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2444.92s)]
*  So I called Mike McCall, and I said, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2447.1600000000003s)]
*  listen, bitch, can I call you bitch? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2449.04s)]
*  I, you, I think I said exactly that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2451.0s)]
*  You told someone I was a Russian agent, [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2453.36s)]
*  like I'm from this country, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2455.36s)]
*  I feel like I'm pretty patriotic. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2456.32s)]
*  And did you say that? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2458.88s)]
*  And he said, yeah, I did say that, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2460.44s)]
*  because the intel briefers told me that. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2462.44s)]
*  And I said, how old are you, son? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2464.92s)]
*  I think he's older than I am. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2466.48s)]
*  You believe your intel briefers? [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2467.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2469.04s)]
*  And he said, yeah, I do. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2470.84s)]
*  I got to give him credit. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2472.54s)]
*  He took my call and the whole thing, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2473.38s)]
*  but I was like, this guy is the most controlled, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2474.96s)]
*  scary, stupid, but also scary person [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2478.0s)]
*  I think I've ever dealt with in Congress, ever. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2481.4s)]
*  So I guess I'm not that surprised that he's, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2483.2000000000003s)]
*  what is it with Texas Republicans anyway? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2486.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2488.36s)]
*  You corrupt a lot of them. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, you go a little bit north of Oklahoma [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2490.44s)]
*  and Mark Wayne Mullin is an interesting one too. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2492.84s)]
*  What do you believe in there? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2495.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know too much about his, he's a fiery guy too. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2496.08s)]
*  Yeah, he was threatened to beat somebody up. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2500.12s)]
*  Yeah, he was threatened. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2501.92s)]
*  Sean O'Brien. The Teamsters, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2502.76s)]
*  the Teamsters president, I think. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2503.84s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, during that, yeah, we built a whole, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2505.32s)]
*  I have a whole thing. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2507.4s)]
*  I like Sean O'Brien for the role. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2508.38s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2509.56s)]
*  Good guy. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2510.4s)]
*  I don't, so that's what's, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2511.2400000000002s)]
*  the thing that's interesting about me, again, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2512.36s)]
*  from my background is I don't know anything [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2514.0s)]
*  about these politicians. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2515.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm not like a political person. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2516.08s)]
*  I call out, we call out the politicians, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2517.44s)]
*  the Democrats, like the New York Times came out [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2519.4s)]
*  with a report in 2022 that said that 180 politicians traded [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2521.52s)]
*  over 3,700 times that totaled over 110, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2527.12s)]
*  115 million dollars of volume in, from 2019 to 2021. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2530.64s)]
*  Out of those, it was literally half, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2536.28s)]
*  pretty much half Democrats, half Republicans. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2538.2400000000002s)]
*  So they're all doing it. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2540.4s)]
*  Of course. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2541.48s)]
*  Out of those 180 politicians, though, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2542.32s)]
*  90 of them sat on committees that directly [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2543.6s)]
*  oversaw companies that they traded. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2545.88s)]
*  And you're like, okay, well, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2549.52s)]
*  so that sounds like a conflict of interest. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2551.12s)]
*  And then that's what's the mark to me to get really [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2552.7200000000003s)]
*  into this and being like, what actually are the trades [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2555.28s)]
*  that are going on? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2557.4s)]
*  Are they outperforming? [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2558.2400000000002s)]

*  but I know this because our app is venture backed. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2878.02s)]
*  He had, again, credit to him. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2881.62s)]
*  He had money in rumble. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2883.66s)]
*  So YouTube's competitor. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2885.18s)]
*  Before he, via his venture capital firm. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2887.1s)]
*  I can't confirm this. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2891.22s)]
*  I've never met him. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2892.2599999999998s)]
*  But when he got into office, before he became VP, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2893.1s)]
*  he sold out of rumble. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2896.42s)]
*  So only the stocks that he owns are just the main ETFs. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2897.5s)]
*  Can I ask you, is there some easy or workable way [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2901.22s)]
*  for members of Congress to put all their investments [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2904.9s)]
*  into some blind? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2908.02s)]
*  Yep. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2909.2999999999997s)]
*  Blind trust? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2910.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2910.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2911.7999999999997s)]
*  So this is where it gets complex. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2912.64s)]
*  And I'd be curious to hear your take on this. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2915.2999999999997s)]
*  So there's bills out there to get it banned. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2917.42s)]
*  I think social media has done a tremendous job with this, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2921.54s)]
*  with the Pelosi tracker, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2923.7000000000003s)]
*  with all of us trying to call out with our app. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2924.86s)]
*  It's like our app, part of it is built [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2927.38s)]
*  to highlight the hypocrisy [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2929.58s)]
*  of just how big of a problem this is. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2931.06s)]
*  $500 million shouldn't be copying Pelosi. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2932.94s)]
*  If they are, that's a problem. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2935.1800000000003s)]
*  So to credit to some of these politicians, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2937.98s)]
*  AOC has done a lot. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2940.58s)]
*  She's a fiery figure, but she has had two bills. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2942.06s)]
*  She actually just released a bill a week ago [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2944.94s)]
*  called the Restore Faith in Government Act. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2947.5s)]
*  And it calls for banning political stock trading. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2950.42s)]
*  There's been around five bills. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2952.98s)]
*  That's good for her. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2953.82s)]
*  Yeah, she's been, she had a bill with Matt Gaetz. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2954.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2957.66s)]
*  The bill that's got the farthest, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2959.2200000000003s)]
*  and this is where, this just frustrates me [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2960.96s)]
*  with all the stuff going on is, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2963.7000000000003s)]
*  there was a bill introduced by Josh Howley, [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2966.18s)]
*  John Ossoff and a couple other politicians. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2969.26s)]
*  The reason why that one's important [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2972.34s)]
*  is because they got that to the Senate. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2973.7999999999997s)]
*  In the Senate, while they were in one of the committees, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2975.3599999999997s)]
*  the way that the bills enter the floor [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2978.8399999999997s)]
*  is they have to get passed off by the committee. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2980.24s)]
*  This is the bill that made it the farthest. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2983.6s)]
*  In that bill though, they offered kind of four things. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2985.6s)]
*  First, members can't trade stocks by 2025. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2988.96s)]
*  This was introduced 2024. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2992.68s)]
*  Members can't trade stocks. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2994.2s)]
*  Second, spouses and dependents can't trade stocks [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2995.72s)]
*  through 2027. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=2999.52s)]
*  Third, any private investment you have, [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3001.52s)]
*  you have to sell out of to run, to become a politician. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3006.12s)]
*  No one has ever asked for that. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3010.56s)]
*  That has never come up and that became a big, big problem. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3013.46s)]
*  This is where it gets scary and we have to be careful [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3017.4s)]
*  with like what we're essentially pushing for. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3019.32s)]
*  So what everyone has asked for on these bills is, [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3021.36s)]
*  no trading, no members and their spouses can trade, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3024.62s)]
*  put it in a blind trust. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3028.04s)]
*  Now this fourth bill, no trading, no members and spouse, [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3029.84s)]
*  blind trust, but also you have to sell out [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3032.52s)]
*  of every private investment. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3034.6400000000003s)]
*  And that when they started debating it, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3036.2400000000002s)]
*  Mitt Romney, Tim Scott, and a couple other politicians [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3039.6000000000004s)]
*  on it were like, wait a second, we can't vote yes on this. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3044.3s)]
*  Like let's take, if you guys are telling me [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3047.8s)]
*  that any future politician that wants to run [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3050.0s)]
*  has to sell out of private investments, [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3052.94s)]
*  that could become a major, major problem. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3055.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, if you want to run and be a politician, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3057.8s)]
*  you'd have to sell out of your businesses. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3060.6s)]
*  If I were to run, I would have to sell it to my businesses. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3061.4399999999996s)]
*  A farmer would have to sell it to his family businesses. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3063.3999999999996s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3066.04s)]
*  Like why are we essentially doing that? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3066.8799999999997s)]
*  And when you take a step back at the time, [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3068.7599999999998s)]
*  this was, you know, Kamala versus Trump. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3070.6s)]
*  Kamala just picked Tim Walz to be the VP. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3073.4399999999996s)]
*  And you think about where the directions [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3077.7599999999998s)]
*  of each parties are going. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3079.48s)]
*  If you have a bill out there that bans politicians [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3081.08s)]
*  from owning in private investments, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3085.16s)]
*  you are turning off kind of a whole part of future people. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3087.82s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, you know, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3092.1800000000003s)]
*  you do kind of want people who are invested in the country, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3097.46s)]
*  you know, who have some like longitudinal stake in America. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3101.82s)]
*  I mean, I do think that like I'm fighting for my, [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3105.9s)]
*  that's why I believe in home ownership, you know, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3108.46s)]
*  cause like I own a piece of ground here. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3110.1800000000003s)]
*  You know it's crazy. It's my country. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3112.1400000000003s)]
*  And you know it's crazy. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3113.34s)]
*  You had Trump and JD Vance, JD Vance, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3115.46s)]
*  probably the most in my lifetime, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3118.42s)]
*  the smartest, like most accomplished, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3121.1s)]
*  like guy running for politics that I've ever seen. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3123.7400000000002s)]
*  I think he's just tremendous. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3126.7s)]
*  You got him with Trump, business guys first, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3130.94s)]
*  politician second. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3133.18s)]
*  You got Vivek, business politician second. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3134.58s)]
*  On the other side, you got Kamala, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3137.06s)]
*  career long politician, 20 plus years. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3138.78s)]
*  Just parasite, yeah. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3140.82s)]
*  Tim Walz, Tim Walz, [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3143.2200000000003s)]
*  you have to disclose what you own. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3144.7000000000003s)]
*  He doesn't own anything. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3146.54s)]
*  Like you even just said, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3147.7400000000002s)]
*  like I own part of land in America. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3148.82s)]
*  He doesn't, from my memory, he doesn't own a house. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3150.62s)]
*  The only thing he owned on that public disclosure [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3154.38s)]
*  was a teacher's pension. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3157.62s)]
*  And then you start, it's like, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3159.62s)]
*  where can we go with this path of, you know, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3161.58s)]
*  pro-business, successful, competent people [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3165.46s)]
*  running our country versus career long politicians [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3169.1s)]
*  that just know how to play the game of thrones in politics [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3172.7s)]
*  to be able to get to where they want. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3175.7s)]
*  Nicely put. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3177.14s)]
*  That scared the shit out of me [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3177.98s)]
*  when they started talking about that. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3180.42s)]
*  At that. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3182.14s)]
*  Well, it may be just a way to kill the whole idea. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3183.14s)]
*  So that was the other thing, is it a kill pill? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3185.06s)]
*  And again, that's why, like, I don't know. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3186.62s)]
*  Yeah, just don't use insider information [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3189.02s)]
*  that you get with my money in the, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3190.94s)]
*  we own all that information that belongs to us. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3192.74s)]
*  It does not belong to Mike McCall [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3194.2599999999998s)]
*  or any of these other douchebags, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3196.22s)]
*  corrupt douchebags like Mike McCall, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3198.06s)]
*  who is, I just want to say again, is a corrupt douchebag. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3200.18s)]
*  I just want to say that really clearly. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3203.3s)]
*  But they don't own this information. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3205.62s)]
*  It belongs to the public. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3207.06s)]
*  It belongs to the US government, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3208.46s)]
*  which is owned by the people [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3209.5s)]
*  who are citizens of this country. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3210.58s)]
*  So just stop that. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3211.62s)]
*  But you don't want to encourage like government by, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3214.46s)]
*  you know, people who own nothing. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3217.5s)]
*  Like what? Government by the homeless? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3219.02s)]
*  I want people who are like, no, my kids live here. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3220.58s)]
*  My grandkids live here. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3222.7400000000002s)]
*  This is our family farm or whatever. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3224.14s)]
*  Like you want that. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3225.7400000000002s)]
*  Skin in the game. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3226.58s)]
*  Skin in the game. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3227.66s)]
*  Protect this country because it's mine. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3228.78s)]
*  Yeah. 100%. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3230.5s)]
*  And give me the incentive. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3231.82s)]
*  I'll give you the outcome. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3234.66s)]
*  It's like, if you have politicians that are incentivized [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3235.82s)]
*  for the good of American families, you know, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3239.46s)]
*  it's like JDM, kids, Trump, pro-family. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3241.42s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3244.9s)]
*  You're going to build for your grandkids, not for you. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3245.74s)]
*  I would ban childless politicians [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3248.78s)]
*  from having too much power. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3250.94s)]
*  Cause it's like, you're not, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3252.02s)]
*  I just know anyone who has kids will tell you. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3253.74s)]
*  It's like, you're really worried about that. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3255.54s)]
*  At a certain point, why do you care? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3257.02s)]
*  You're going to die anyway, [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3258.8599999999997s)]
*  but you care about the next generation. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3259.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3261.2999999999997s)]
*  And you know, give Ro Kahana credit. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3262.14s)]
*  The representative out of San Francisco, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3264.7799999999997s)]
*  he's doing a lot on social media. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3267.4199999999996s)]
*  He doesn't have as much power, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3269.18s)]
*  but he's calling for term limits. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3270.8999999999996s)]
*  And I think cause we're looking at, you know, again, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3272.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm 29. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3274.62s)]
*  I'm not, I don't, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3275.4599999999996s)]
*  I'm just out here just calling citizen journalism on X, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3276.8999999999996s)]
*  being like, this is ridiculous. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3280.02s)]
*  Let me build with my, like my skillset is, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3281.62s)]
*  I feel like I can do, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3284.5s)]
*  I know how to use social media algorithms. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3286.26s)]
*  And I know how to build a product [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3288.78s)]
*  to get people involved in it. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3290.02s)]
*  Let me use this as the best way in my ability [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3291.14s)]
*  as an American citizen to promote change, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3293.58s)]
*  to bring trust back into the institutions. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3296.06s)]
*  A big part of the problem looking at it is like, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3298.34s)]
*  what are these 85 year olds doing? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3300.78s)]
*  I agree. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3302.7s)]
*  And you know, for 30 years. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3303.54s)]
*  It's just so obviously unwise, you know. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3305.38s)]
*  Yeah. At 85, at 75, you know, [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3309.54s)]
*  it's just harder to, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3312.26s)]
*  don't have the mental acuity. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3313.82s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3314.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a biological fact, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3315.86s)]
*  but ignoring biology is one of our main, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3316.82s)]
*  our main pastimes at this point. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3318.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm grown up with that. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3320.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3321.1800000000003s)]
*  My mom's a pediatrician. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3322.1000000000004s)]
*  I know. Oh, is she really? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3323.3s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3324.1400000000003s)]
*  Believes in biology. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3324.98s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3325.82s)]
*  That's pretty funny. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3328.78s)]
*  So tell us about the war stocks. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3329.6600000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry, I had to calm down before you went down. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3333.94s)]
*  That's really dark. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3336.6200000000003s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that people are encouraging war [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3337.98s)]
*  because they're profiting from it? [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3341.02s)]
*  Yeah, that, this is the, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3343.98s)]
*  this topic gets a lot of conversation on TikTok [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3346.3s)]
*  and Instagram in particular. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3351.58s)]
*  Just mainly because it's like, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3352.86s)]
*  warmongering, not warmongering, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3354.3s)]
*  the idea of even being able to profit from war [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3356.34s)]
*  probably shouldn't be allowed. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3359.1400000000003s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3360.7400000000002s)]
*  But they do. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3362.2200000000003s)]
*  And you know, whether they do it inherently or not, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3363.2200000000003s)]
*  the three main companies are Lockheed Martin, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3366.34s)]
*  General Dynamics and Raytheon Technologies. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3368.54s)]
*  Raytheon, Raytheon's hard because Raytheon is the company [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3371.14s)]
*  behind the Israel's Iron Dome. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3375.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3377.8599999999997s)]
*  So Israel and Hamas, that's pro-Raytheon. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3378.7s)]
*  Like Raytheon's now selling missiles for the Iron Dome [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3383.1s)]
*  that we're watching on X go off every two days back then [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3386.22s)]
*  when that all went to Iran and all that, and Lebanon. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3389.58s)]
*  But the politicians, Markway and Mullen, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3395.74s)]
*  he sits on the Armed Services Committee. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3398.66s)]
*  He owns Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3401.02s)]
*  And we've called them out for it [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3403.1s)]
*  because that's to another degree [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3405.66s)]
*  because you sit on the committee. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3407.5s)]
*  Never heard anything about it. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3409.74s)]
*  Unusual Wales has a great report on this. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3412.14s)]
*  What could possibly, and again, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3413.62s)]
*  I've only met Markway and Mullen once. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3415.54s)]
*  He's a friend of a friend of mine who says he's great. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3417.62s)]
*  He seemed nice. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3419.9s)]
*  But what could possibly be the excuse [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3421.02s)]
*  for owning defense stocks [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3423.7s)]
*  if you sit on the committee that funds them? [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3425.18s)]
*  Yeah, so this is what's the problem [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3427.2999999999997s)]
*  with the way that they disclose right now [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3430.02s)]
*  is I don't know which ones are theirs [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3432.26s)]
*  or which ones are being run by a financial advisor [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3434.7s)]
*  because some of them have financial advisors [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3437.58s)]
*  running their portfolios, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3441.1s)]
*  but they still have to disclose it. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3442.18s)]
*  My hope is that it's financial advisors [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3444.02s)]
*  running some of these portfolios. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3446.54s)]
*  My hope would be, and I'm sure that's right. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3448.58s)]
*  I mean, I guess I have stocks, I have no idea what they are. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3450.38s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3452.82s)]
*  Whatever, I've got some person doing that, I guess. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3454.5s)]
*  But I would hope that they would be thoughtful enough [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3458.18s)]
*  that if you sit on a committee that's overseeing an industry [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3462.14s)]
*  that you would just call up to your broker and say, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3466.02s)]
*  hey, we can't buy anything that I regulate. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3467.7799999999997s)]
*  Five minutes, that's all it takes. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3470.66s)]
*  Right? Yeah. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3472.46s)]
*  And again, this is... [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3473.2999999999997s)]
*  And you put that out there publicly and he still owns those. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3475.42s)]
*  Yeah, we call out everybody. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3477.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3479.7s)]
*  There's no one that we, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3480.62s)]
*  there's no politics, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3482.14s)]
*  like we called out the new politician this morning. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3482.98s)]
*  Can't remember his name. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3486.5s)]
*  Yeah, he's a Republican from Kentucky [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3488.3399999999997s)]
*  who sits on the accountability committee. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3489.8999999999996s)]
*  He traded for the first time in three years. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3493.8199999999997s)]
*  We made a tweet about him. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3497.2599999999998s)]
*  Dan Goldman. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3499.74s)]
*  So Dan Goldman, he's a rich guy from New York. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3500.98s)]
*  We called him out to the point where he stopped trading [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3504.98s)]
*  because we were making all these tweets of like... [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3507.62s)]
*  Well, he's got a ton of inherited money. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3509.7s)]
*  A ton of inherited money, yeah. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3510.8999999999996s)]
*  And credit to him, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3512.3799999999997s)]
*  but I think this is the power of social media [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3513.58s)]
*  and I think this is a win, in my opinion, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3514.98s)]
*  putting in a blind trust or just tell your, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3517.7400000000002s)]
*  while you're a freaking politician, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3520.7400000000002s)]
*  just go put it in the market. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3522.5s)]
*  Like just don't buy individual stocks [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3523.7400000000002s)]
*  for the four or five years, eight, 10 years. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3525.5400000000004s)]
*  Just put it in index fund. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3527.38s)]
*  Just put it in index fund. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3528.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's not... [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3529.0600000000004s)]
*  Just do what everyone else is doing. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3530.5400000000004s)]
*  You know? [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3532.38s)]
*  Like... [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3533.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, that's such a good point. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3534.0600000000004s)]
*  It's not rocket science. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3535.3s)]
*  And that's why I don't feel bad for calling out anybody [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3536.6200000000003s)]
*  because it's like, Dan Crenshaw, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3540.1000000000004s)]
*  you're gonna complain about it, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3543.3s)]
*  just sell out of it and go put it in an index fund. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3544.42s)]
*  No one's stopping you. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3547.22s)]
*  Well, then you could plausibly say [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3548.34s)]
*  if you had an index fund, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3549.42s)]
*  which is just the whole market, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3550.42s)]
*  you could just say, I'm betting on America. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3551.86s)]
*  Great, good for you. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3554.5s)]
*  I want you to do that. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3555.34s)]
*  Pro America. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3556.18s)]
*  And that's why, like, if you were to ask me, [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3557.02s)]
*  what is the solution? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3559.18s)]
*  I think the solution is kind of two things [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3560.82s)]
*  for how do you solve this whole thing. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3563.26s)]
*  And again, like our mission is, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3565.18s)]
*  we're trying to instill trust back in society. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3566.62s)]
*  Like I'm pro America. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3569.06s)]
*  You know, I want my grandkids to do well. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3570.22s)]
*  I don't think a society functions [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3572.42s)]
*  if you can't trust your institutions. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3575.7400000000002s)]
*  That's right. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3577.6200000000003s)]
*  And it starts with the politicians. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3578.46s)]
*  So like, look at, I'm going off on a tangent, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3579.34s)]
*  but you know, I live in LA. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3581.94s)]
*  California, your heart breaks for it. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3583.6200000000003s)]
*  And then you just are like, I don't know what to believe. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3586.5s)]
*  Cause these, you got Newsome, [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3588.7000000000003s)]
*  you got everything going on on X. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3590.34s)]
*  There's conflicting sides. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3593.0600000000004s)]
*  And you go on and you say, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3594.6200000000003s)]
*  hey, if you loot, you will get arrested. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3596.46s)]
*  Okay, you guys are telling me that. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3600.34s)]
*  I've watched for the past two years, [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3601.6600000000003s)]
*  everybody loot and no one get arrested. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3604.06s)]
*  So you're now at this point where we're supposed to trust you [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3606.62s)]
*  on this fact that, oh, if you loot now, you'll get arrested. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3609.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, you've promoted and incentivized that behavior [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3613.22s)]
*  for people to get away with it. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3617.2599999999998s)]
*  And what do you think happens? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3618.5s)]
*  No one's going to believe you. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3619.58s)]
*  The trust is gone. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3620.94s)]
*  What happens? [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3621.86s)]
*  So do you feel, this sidebar, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3622.7s)]
*  but you feel as a resident of LA, San Monica, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3624.3s)]
*  you've watched looting for the past two years [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3627.78s)]
*  cause that's really what it is. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3629.82s)]
*  Yeah, I haven't seen it in particular, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3630.66s)]
*  but I mean, you can't walk into a CVS. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3632.86s)]
*  Like the amount of times I've walked into CVS [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3635.06s)]
*  and your heart breaks for the little girl [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3637.94s)]
*  behind the cashier having to deal with these guys [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3642.1800000000003s)]
*  is walking in and out. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3644.98s)]
*  Like, cause you do see it and it's scary. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3646.42s)]
*  That's looting on smaller proportions, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3649.7000000000003s)]
*  but you for sure see it in California. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3651.42s)]
*  I think it's major. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3653.86s)]
*  I think things fall apart when you see stuff like that. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3654.86s)]
*  Why doesn't someone shoot them? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3656.82s)]
*  I always think that. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3657.86s)]
*  I only see it on video. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3659.26s)]
*  I haven't been to a CVS in a while, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3660.38s)]
*  but I think it's just, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3662.18s)]
*  it's like you're begging for total collapse [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3664.2999999999997s)]
*  if you allow that. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3666.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3667.06s)]
*  And my, I'm a first principle thinker. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3667.8999999999996s)]
*  I think it's trust. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3670.46s)]
*  I just don't think people trust that things will get done. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3671.4199999999996s)]
*  And now if you take it out, you know, I love California. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3675.06s)]
*  I don't think it's as bad as people make it sound, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3677.58s)]
*  but if you can't trust the politicians, society crumbles. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3680.22s)]
*  And I see you with the trading. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3683.8999999999996s)]
*  If you can't trust the majority of politicians, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3686.02s)]
*  America will crumble. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3688.54s)]
*  Cause why would I believe what the politician [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3689.62s)]
*  is telling me while I'm watching them do these other things [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3692.54s)]
*  right in front of my face and I can't do anything about it. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3694.82s)]
*  So we want them banned to get the trust back into that. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3697.1800000000003s)]
*  But problem with the ban is, is it constant? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3700.38s)]
*  Like if in that ban, you would have to ban the kids [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3704.7400000000002s)]
*  and you would have to ban the spouses from trading. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3710.58s)]
*  Is it constitutionally allowed to say, hey, you know, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3712.98s)]
*  say you're a Senator from Florida and you're like, hey, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3716.7000000000003s)]
*  Tucker, you want to be a Senator, that's fine. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3721.14s)]
*  But per the stock act now, your kids can't trade stocks [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3724.14s)]
*  and your spouse can't trade stocks. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3727.06s)]
*  What if your kid is a hedge fund manager or your kid is, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3729.02s)]
*  you know, like how do you ban that kid? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3731.5s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3733.8199999999997s)]
*  It's hard. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3734.66s)]
*  I mean, well, like any, any system is voluntary basically. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3735.5s)]
*  I mean, if everyone tries to subvert a system of any kind, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3738.58s)]
*  the system will collapse. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3742.06s)]
*  So people have to decide like, [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3743.14s)]
*  I want to be a better person and not take everything I can. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3744.58s)]
*  Don't be greedy. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3748.18s)]
*  Don't be selfish. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3749.58s)]
*  I mean, it's the things you tell your kids. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3751.6600000000003s)]
*  Like you show up at somebody's house, [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3752.86s)]
*  you're eight years old on Halloween [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3754.42s)]
*  and there's a huge basket of Hershey's cases. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3755.54s)]
*  Don't take everyone. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3759.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, when you're Halloween trick or treating, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3759.94s)]
*  you're not taking every big Reese's bar. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3762.2200000000003s)]
*  They don't have Halloween in Africa [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3764.34s)]
*  because people just take every Reese's bar. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3765.6200000000003s)]
*  But here we always have because there's a lot of self [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3768.02s)]
*  restraint in the population. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3770.9s)]
*  So what do you do about that? [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3772.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3773.5s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3774.82s)]
*  I don't know either. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3775.6600000000003s)]
*  But I think a solution though can be in, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3776.5s)]
*  this is where like get rid of the delay, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3778.58s)]
*  make them file the same day [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3781.94s)]
*  so that you increase transparency around that. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3783.38s)]
*  How long is it like now? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3785.86s)]
*  45 days. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3786.82s)]
*  And I did a lot of Reese's, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3787.74s)]
*  I couldn't figure out why there was a delay to begin with. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3789.42s)]
*  Like I don't understand why do you need a 45 day delay? [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3791.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3795.58s)]
*  That's per the stock act. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3796.7799999999997s)]
*  But also once you get rid of the delay, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3798.14s)]
*  just make it so that either the politicians [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3800.98s)]
*  have to invest in a blind trust or major ETFs, [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3803.58s)]
*  or if you're not gonna go that far, [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3807.18s)]
*  just don't allow them to trade companies they oversee. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3809.74s)]
*  And it's very, very simple. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3812.58s)]
*  If I'm a consultant covering pharmaceutical industry [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3813.8199999999997s)]
*  at Deloitte, Deloitte does not allow that consultant [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3818.06s)]
*  to buy pharmaceutical stocks. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3821.3399999999997s)]
*  They can buy other stocks, [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3823.02s)]
*  but they can't buy pharmaceutical. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3824.1s)]
*  And like, it's all just a step in the right direction [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3825.7799999999997s)]
*  towards something that like we can get on the right path [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3829.46s)]
*  to trusting the politicians again. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3832.54s)]
*  And that's like my goal. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3833.94s)]
*  I think the fact you're watching makes a big difference. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3834.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it has to, right? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3837.3399999999997s)]
*  I think it has, yeah. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3838.94s)]
*  That's what I tell myself. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3839.7799999999997s)]
*  Have you thought about calling DOJ [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3840.62s)]
*  or copying DOJ on some of these social media posts [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3843.1s)]
*  and saying, you know, maybe there should be [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3848.3799999999997s)]
*  a criminal referral here. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3850.22s)]
*  Yeah, and we haven't. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3851.7799999999997s)]
*  Maybe that's the next step. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3853.22s)]
*  The SEC has never investigated any of them. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3855.8999999999996s)]
*  And I think the SEC just has a ton of stuff on their hands, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3858.42s)]
*  to be honest. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3860.54s)]
*  Well, that's for sure. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3861.3799999999997s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3862.3799999999997s)]
*  Because there's a lot of corruption in the country now. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3863.3799999999997s)]
*  It's not just the Congress. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3864.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and the hard part about this is the SEC [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3866.02s)]
*  there's billion dollar schemes. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3870.22s)]
*  Like they should have found SPF, you know, kind of thing. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3871.7400000000002s)]
*  The politicians is not the major, major thing [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3874.7400000000002s)]
*  on the monetary side. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3878.46s)]
*  But it is though on the public image side. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3879.78s)]
*  And that's what I think like, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3882.78s)]
*  I don't think people understand the long-term effects [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3884.42s)]
*  of not trusting institutions. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3886.66s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3888.02s)]
*  And there should be a priesthood, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3888.86s)]
*  a secular priesthood in charge. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3890.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3891.94s)]
*  That's why they call them public servants. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3892.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3894.14s)]
*  They're giving up something to serve their country. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3895.9s)]
*  I don't think that's unfair to ask people to do that. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3897.9s)]
*  I feel like they've forgotten about it. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3899.66s)]
*  They forgot the whole fruit, you know. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3901.14s)]
*  If you've been paying attention, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3903.22s)]
*  you know that Alp is not just another nicotine pouch. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3904.38s)]
*  It is literally the best nicotine pouch in the world. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3907.58s)]
*  And we know because we use it all day long. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3912.66s)]
*  We've used all of them. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3915.1s)]
*  Turns out you can actually make money [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3916.14s)]
*  by telling people about Alp. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3917.26s)]
*  We're launching our affiliate program. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3918.58s)]

*  By the way, compared to all the other products [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3932.2999999999997s)]
*  people sell online, Alp is truly good. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3933.54s)]
*  It's delicious. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3936.7799999999997s)]
*  It is easy to sell because it's heartfelt. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3938.06s)]
*  So spread the word, get rewarded for it. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3940.2999999999997s)]
*  Best nicotine pouch in the world. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3942.14s)]
*  How are defense stocks doing? [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3947.74s)]
*  They're up. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3949.46s)]
*  They're up. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3950.2999999999997s)]
*  They were not earlier this year, I believe. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3951.2999999999997s)]
*  But I think the one that I followed in particular [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3954.7799999999997s)]
*  was Raytheon and I think Raytheon's up around 80%. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3958.54s)]
*  So my thought is Lockheed and General Dynamics are up too. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3960.98s)]
*  But there's smaller ones. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3965.18s)]
*  I mean, Tommy Tuberville bought this company called [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3966.02s)]
*  Humisite. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3969.9s)]
*  And what Humisite does is it treats soldiers [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3971.1s)]
*  injured in war in Ukraine. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3974.06s)]
*  And he bought that stock. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3976.3799999999997s)]
*  We flagged it because he sits on the Armed Services Committee [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3977.9s)]
*  and if you go on the Armed Services website, [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3981.98s)]
*  it literally says helping companies do military research. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3983.02s)]
*  He buys the company that does military research. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3988.58s)]
*  The stock was up, I think, at the peak of it, 100%. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3991.2999999999997s)]
*  He sold out early, so I think he made 30%. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3994.42s)]
*  But it's not even just, my point is it's not necessarily [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=3997.14s)]
*  even just Lockheed, Raytheon. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4000.02s)]
*  It's these companies that get military government contracts [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4002.94s)]
*  to help the long tails up these wars. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4005.7799999999997s)]
*  That's all of Northern Virginia. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4007.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4009.38s)]
*  I know, yeah, I was listening to a couple of your other [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4010.5s)]
*  podcasts. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4012.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I've spent my life there, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4013.14s)]
*  so I'm deeply resentful. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4015.1s)]
*  And it's also very ugly, which tells you a lot. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4016.18s)]
*  What they do for a living is ugly. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4018.7799999999997s)]
*  Killing people is the ugliest thing you could do. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4020.14s)]
*  But they've also constructed an incredibly ugly world [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4022.2599999999998s)]
*  physically. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4025.22s)]
*  Like if you drive from Dulles Airport into the city, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4026.06s)]
*  you see not a single pretty building. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4028.62s)]
*  Everything is awful and it's a reflection of their souls, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4030.7s)]
*  in my opinion. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4033.18s)]
*  Others disagree. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4034.58s)]
*  Tell us, and I went right over this, I'm sorry, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4036.4199999999996s)]
*  but about Jim Cramer. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4038.3399999999997s)]
*  You have an inverse Jim Cramer. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4039.42s)]
*  So if you were to invest with Jim Cramer, [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4041.66s)]
*  would you do better or worse than say Debbie Wasserman [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4045.78s)]
*  Schultz or Nancy Pelosi? [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4048.14s)]
*  In 2024, you would have done better. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4049.3s)]
*  And this is all up, if people want to go on joinautopilot.com [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4051.78s)]
*  or even on our app Autopilot, you'll see all these numbers [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4055.98s)]
*  because I don't want to mess up the numbers. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4058.42s)]
*  Yeah, of course, yeah. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4059.94s)]
*  But Cramer was up 48%. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4061.7400000000002s)]
*  Stock market was up around 25%. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4063.66s)]
*  He was up, not inverse. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4065.54s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4066.9s)]
*  Inverse Cramer was up 48%. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4068.58s)]
*  Oh, inverse Cramer. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4069.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so when you're talking about Cramer, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4070.66s)]
*  you're talking about Cramer's stupidity. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4072.58s)]
*  Do the opposite. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4074.22s)]
*  The opposite of Cramer was up 48%. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4075.06s)]
*  And we balance that thing on a monthly basis. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4077.3399999999997s)]
*  He has his own stock group, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4079.7s)]
*  which maybe we'll pay to get the subscription in [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4081.3399999999997s)]
*  to actually see the stocks that he's talking about. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4084.3799999999997s)]
*  He has this through CNBC. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4086.8199999999997s)]
*  But yeah, he was up inverse. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4089.74s)]
*  But inverse Cramer has done 48%. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4090.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4095.06s)]
*  It's... [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4096.7s)]
*  Do you think it's a gag? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4098.94s)]
*  I think it's social media. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4100.82s)]
*  Not even social media. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4102.38s)]
*  I think it's just how media works. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4103.3s)]
*  It's headlines and you have to talk about... [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4105.78s)]
*  But he's like a Harvard graduate [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4108.18s)]
*  who's like a genius, everybody. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4109.62s)]
*  He's a man, obviously not a genius. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4110.82s)]
*  But he's employed to tell you about the stock market, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4113.22s)]
*  but betting against him gets you 48%. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4115.98s)]
*  Like, how does that work? [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4118.0599999999995s)]
*  And he has a private stock market group [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4118.9s)]
*  that does all this stuff [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4121.82s)]
*  that he tells people with personal stock picks [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4123.86s)]
*  and stuff like that. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4127.26s)]
*  So it's not even just he gets employed [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4128.1s)]
*  and does it on social media and TV. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4128.94s)]
*  He has a personal group that does it. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4130.26s)]
*  But yeah, that one blows my mind [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4132.26s)]
*  because I don't know how you can say, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4135.7s)]
*  don't sell Tesla and the stock goes up 100%. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4138.46s)]
*  There's a tremendous video from when early days with Tesla, [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4142.74s)]
*  when Cramer is essentially talking about Tesla says, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4147.34s)]
*  it's trash, get rid of it. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4150.1s)]
*  Don't even talk about it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4152.14s)]
*  From that day, the stock, some thousands, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4153.54s)]
*  thousands and thousands of percent up. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4156.66s)]
*  And Elon loves it. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4158.38s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4159.22s)]
*  Do you think like Cramer, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4160.38s)]
*  like why would they employ Cramer? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4163.5s)]
*  How could he be that bad? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4165.7s)]
*  If you just employed like your dog [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4168.58s)]
*  or a whole bunch of dogs. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4171.58s)]
*  You get a chicken. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4172.66s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4173.5s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4174.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4175.16s)]
*  Do you have any guesses? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4177.22s)]
*  No, I mean, I think like, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4178.78s)]
*  if I'm thinking about it, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4183.9s)]
*  cause I haven't really thought too much about it [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4184.94s)]
*  on the sense of how does it actually like, [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4187.26s)]
*  how can it actually do it so well? [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4189.62s)]
*  My thought is maybe though, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4191.58s)]
*  like the way that the markets work [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4193.1s)]
*  and I'm no expert at this is, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4195.0199999999995s)]
*  you want to buy the news and sell the, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4197.18s)]
*  or buy the buildup and then you sell the news. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4200.0199999999995s)]
*  Cramer could just be slow [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4202.86s)]
*  with getting onto these popular stocks. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4204.14s)]
*  So that by the time he's talking about Tesla, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4206.86s)]
*  by the time he's talking about, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4208.78s)]
*  hey, go buy Nvidia. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4209.86s)]
*  It's like, yeah, everyone's been talking about Nvidia [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4212.3s)]
*  for six months before you start talking about it. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4214.900000000001s)]
*  The portfolio that we have for him on autopilot [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4217.06s)]
*  is $15 million following him, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4219.02s)]
*  following his inverse picks. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4221.26s)]
*  So essentially there's a, [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4223.18s)]
*  we have a pseudo ETF ish sort of thing [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4225.1s)]
*  that does the exact opposite of it. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4229.7s)]
*  All based on his stupidity. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4231.54s)]
*  All based on his stupidity, yeah. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4232.38s)]
*  Or all based on what he thinks is right [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4233.860000000001s)]
*  that turns out to be wrong. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4236.18s)]
*  That's incredible. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4238.18s)]
*  So you got venture backing for all the, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4240.02s)]
*  because it does sound like I love everything I love at all, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4242.5s)]
*  but the fact that you made a business out of it [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4245.66s)]
*  is especially amazing. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4247.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4248.339999999999s)]
*  That's been a journey. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4249.86s)]
*  And again, I don't come from this world. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4250.74s)]
*  I was living in Bali before we started this thing [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4253.46s)]
*  and Brian, Aaron, Scott, my co-founders, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4256.7s)]
*  we all did this stuff together. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4260.339999999999s)]
*  We didn't think it would get this big. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4261.5s)]
*  We got a lot of nos. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4263.5s)]
*  And the slogan of what our app essentially was, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4264.86s)]
*  was invest like a politician. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4267.379999999999s)]
*  So if your app says invest like a politician, [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4269.42s)]
*  how big can that thing actually become? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4272.78s)]
*  How popular can that actually be? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4273.74s)]
*  Turns out it can be very popular [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4275.82s)]
*  because not only are they good, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4277.42s)]
*  it's also the perfect, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4278.58s)]
*  it's the perfect way to highlight the hypocrisy. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4281.219999999999s)]
*  Because it's like, what better way to highlight [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4284.099999999999s)]
*  the hypocrisy of politician stock trading [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4285.7s)]
*  than to literally build an app [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4288.0599999999995s)]
*  to invest alongside that hypocrisy. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4289.46s)]
*  And the next thing you know, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4292.219999999999s)]
*  you got ABC News talking about us. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4293.259999999999s)]
*  Elon's retweeted us. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4295.179999999999s)]
*  Major thanks to you. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4298.099999999999s)]
*  This is the first time [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4299.179999999999s)]
*  we've ever had a long form conversation about this. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4300.42s)]
*  Our app is, when we launched it, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4302.78s)]
*  we were number two in the app store. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4304.7s)]
*  No way. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4306.42s)]
*  The whole thing blew up right before our very eyes. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4307.26s)]
*  And the Pelosi tracker was a great part of that. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4310.42s)]
*  But we have much, much bigger, much broader ambitions. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4313.9800000000005s)]
*  And that's where the venture backed part comes in. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4317.3s)]
*  What's so cool is that, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4319.9800000000005s)]
*  so you've built a whole business mocking [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4321.06s)]
*  and simultaneously profiting from the corruption [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4324.26s)]
*  of politicians, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4327.46s)]
*  but you're at the same time calling for an end to it. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4328.58s)]
*  If we lose the politician stock trading, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4333.42s)]
*  we lose a major chunk of our business, for sure. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4335.62s)]
*  But you're still in favor of losing it. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4337.9s)]
*  100%, 100%. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4339.26s)]
*  Cause our mission is to instill trust [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4341.0199999999995s)]
*  back in the institutions. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4342.94s)]
*  And I'm not an expert at this, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4345.0199999999995s)]
*  but this topic, but like the way that we see it [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4348.62s)]
*  is knock out the politicians. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4351.86s)]
*  And this is all through autopilot. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4354.3s)]
*  Autopilots are like our slogan in the broader, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4355.62s)]
*  when we pitch investors. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4358.0199999999995s)]
*  I love the name by the way. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4358.86s)]
*  Yeah, I know, put your money on it. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4359.7s)]
*  It's to redefine money management. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4361.98s)]
*  So I'm 29 and we're about to go through [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4364.66s)]
*  the greatest wealth transfer in the history of the world. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4367.0599999999995s)]
*  85 trillion is about to be parked on people like my doorstep. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4369.74s)]
*  Say I get half a million dollars. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4374.74s)]
*  This is when the boomers die. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4376.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, this is when the boomers die. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4377.459999999999s)]
*  And part of that money is in housing, [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4378.94s)]
*  but there still is a lot that goes into money management. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4380.5s)]
*  75% of kids who inherit their parents' money [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4383.820000000001s)]
*  fire their parents' financial advisor [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4388.820000000001s)]
*  the day they get that money. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4390.820000000001s)]
*  So now you got a kid who has half a million dollars [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4392.14s)]
*  parked on his lap, fires the financial manager [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4395.34s)]
*  cause it's like, who the heck are you? [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4398.34s)]
*  And now they have to make the decisions [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4399.820000000001s)]
*  of how do I invest this money? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4401.58s)]
*  Do I do it on my own? [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4402.78s)]
*  Do I do it through a Google search, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4404.42s)]
*  pick the top financial advisor? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4406.26s)]
*  Do I do it through a friend? [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4407.66s)]
*  We think there's a lot of problems in that. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4409.66s)]
*  And there's no trust and transparency in those decisions. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4413.38s)]
*  So with autopilot, what we're trying to do [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4416.219999999999s)]
*  is solve that trust and transparent way [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4418.0199999999995s)]
*  by building a marketplace to find a money manager [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4420.179999999999s)]
*  and then invest through that money manager [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4423.94s)]
*  in a way that you still have control. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4425.86s)]
*  And I think like what you said earlier, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4427.9s)]
*  and I'm sorry for rambling, but- [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4430.259999999999s)]
*  No, I love it. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4431.58s)]
*  The big, big thing that we're trying to do is [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4432.42s)]
*  we're trying to ensure that people's money [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4437.139999999999s)]
*  builds the futures that they want. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4439.139999999999s)]
*  And I think in 2030, 2035, 2040, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4441.22s)]
*  this is gonna become a bigger and bigger thing. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4443.900000000001s)]
*  And a good example of the early inklings of this is this, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4445.62s)]
*  whether it's conspiracy theory or not, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4449.740000000001s)]
*  we'll see what happens with it. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4451.780000000001s)]
*  But this topic of BlackRock and Vanguard having money [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4454.1s)]
*  in taking the assets in their own ETFs and stuff [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4458.5s)]
*  and using that to sway public laws and public opinion [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4463.780000000001s)]
*  in the states that they oversee. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4469.42s)]
*  They're getting sued in Texas, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4472.179999999999s)]
*  they're getting sued in Florida. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4473.54s)]
*  And part of like, again, whether that's true or not, [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4475.179999999999s)]
*  what annoys me personally when I invest is [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4478.219999999999s)]
*  I want to make sure that my money goes towards my beliefs. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4481.34s)]
*  And if you have someone else managing your money [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4484.78s)]
*  or you put your money in a Vanguard, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4487.099999999999s)]
*  you put your money in a BlackRock, [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4488.74s)]
*  there's possibilities for that to happen [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4490.78s)]
*  at a much broader scale than if you do it on your own. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4492.66s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4495.58s)]
*  And that's what we're trying to build that. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4496.42s)]
*  We're trying to essentially build out the way [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4499.74s)]
*  that you can have your money managed [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4501.14s)]
*  without you having to sacrifice your own values, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4502.26s)]
*  your own voter rights, your own beliefs. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4505.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4507.14s)]
*  Yeah, you don't wanna turn over your money [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4508.02s)]
*  to someone who's trying to eliminate all your rights. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4510.14s)]
*  I mean, that's crazy. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4512.58s)]
*  It's contradictory. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4513.9800000000005s)]
*  And it works for both sides. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4515.22s)]
*  For me personally, pro-America, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4518.7s)]
*  I don't want any dollars invested in Chinese stocks. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4520.18s)]
*  And if I have maybe a couple hundred bucks [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4524.34s)]
*  if you're trying to swing in Alibaba, [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4527.02s)]
*  but if you got half a million dollars in retirement, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4528.54s)]
*  I don't want any of that invested in Alibaba [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4531.38s)]
*  because inherently you are funding a future [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4534.06s)]
*  where Alibaba succeeds. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4538.46s)]
*  Do you want that? [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4540.22s)]
*  And the other side is we have customers [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4541.46s)]
*  and we have clients that are like, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4543.7s)]
*  I don't want my money invested in oil companies. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4544.78s)]
*  I want to be pro-EV. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4547.82s)]
*  It's like, okay, but did you know [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4549.860000000001s)]
*  that you got your retirement account with these other people [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4551.3s)]
*  and they have money in Chevron, Oxy, things like that. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4553.5s)]
*  That's like what we're trying to solve [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4559.02s)]
*  and trying to build to. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4560.38s)]
*  And again, it all starts with just trust. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4561.26s)]
*  Cause if you can't trust even where your money [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4563.7s)]
*  is being invested, what does that mean? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4565.86s)]
*  In my opinion, that means society is worse off [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4568.54s)]
*  cause you don't even trust how your money is being managed [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4571.9s)]
*  in that state that you're in. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4575.38s)]
*  Right, and it changes people if they conclude [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4576.78s)]
*  that the whole deal is a scam. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4579.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4582.98s)]
*  I live a lot of the year in a really rural area [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4584.139999999999s)]
*  and my whole life, no one I knew ever took [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4586.139999999999s)]
*  any government benefits. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4590.179999999999s)]
*  Cause the idea was that we're like proud, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4591.139999999999s)]
*  working class people were not doing that. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4594.339999999999s)]
*  And then the state brought in all these immigrants [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4595.94s)]
*  from Africa and gave them everything. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4597.78s)]
*  Houses, phones, airplane tickets, food vouchers, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4601.099999999999s)]
*  free medical, just these are immigrants [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4604.459999999999s)]
*  getting all this free stuff. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4607.259999999999s)]
*  And everyone in the town where I am, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4608.5s)]
*  which very few immigrants or people, [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4610.419999999999s)]
*  people I knew were like, wait a second, [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4613.66s)]
*  I served in the military, I've worked, paid tax [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4615.34s)]
*  my whole life, I never gotten anything from the government. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4617.62s)]
*  Screw it, I'm putting in for any benefit [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4619.7s)]
*  I possibly can in it. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4622.62s)]
*  And it's easy for me to disapprove cause I'm rich. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4623.74s)]
*  So it's like, I don't have to do that, but I got it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4627.259999999999s)]
*  It's like they all of a sudden realize people [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4629.299999999999s)]
*  who've lived in this country their whole lives, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4631.42s)]
*  did a lot for the country, I would argue, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4634.099999999999s)]
*  they realized the whole thing's a freaking scam. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4635.86s)]
*  So I might as well get in on it. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4637.5s)]
*  If you have that attitude, man, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4639.42s)]
*  things fall apart like that. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4640.5s)]
*  Look at COVID. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4642.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4643.18s)]
*  Happened with all the COVID loans. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4644.58s)]
*  The PBO stuff or whatever. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4646.5s)]
*  Pelosi was a big part of this too. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4647.860000000001s)]
*  The PBO stuff. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4649.54s)]
*  The PBO with the employees. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4650.78s)]
*  So there's documents, so Pelosi owns a hotel up in Napa. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4652.820000000001s)]
*  I think it's a hotel. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4658.58s)]
*  And she has had this one property [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4660.5s)]
*  that has made $100,000, lost $100,000. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4663.22s)]
*  You all have to file this every year. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4666.46s)]
*  And in it, you have your income. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4668.5s)]
*  Made 100K, lost 100K, made 100K, lost 100K. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4670.14s)]
*  The year that COVID happened, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4673.780000000001s)]
*  they made 5 million plus in profit. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4676.14s)]
*  So how do you go from, and this is income. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4679.620000000001s)]
*  This isn't necessarily even just like, [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4681.780000000001s)]
*  like it's not necessarily loans or anything. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4684.42s)]
*  This is income. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4685.9800000000005s)]
*  You lose 100K, you make 100K, COVID happens, [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4687.26s)]
*  the loans go out, your business now makes 5 million. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4691.38s)]
*  Year after that, you go back down to making 100K [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4695.34s)]
*  and then making 100K, losing 100K. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4698.1s)]
*  So there was an anomaly. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4700.38s)]
*  This came out, I think by the New York Post [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4701.46s)]
*  right after Thanksgiving, I think. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4704.58s)]
*  And they highlight this. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4707.42s)]
*  And it's like, was the corruption around these PPP loans, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4708.740000000001s)]
*  these COVID loans, did this get up to the degree [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4712.9400000000005s)]
*  that the politicians were benefiting from this too? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4717.14s)]
*  And it seems like it did. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4720.54s)]
*  So that's again, like the, that frustrates me [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4721.860000000001s)]
*  because we have a family company. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4725.1s)]
*  We sell sports compression products, little arm sleeves. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4727.3s)]
*  We don't necessarily have employees, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4729.780000000001s)]
*  but you know, we're a small family business. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4731.66s)]
*  We took out a loan to survive because we sell in sports. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4733.54s)]
*  Sports got canceled. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4737.860000000001s)]
*  We have to pay that loan back, which is fine. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4739.5s)]
*  We knew that when we took it out [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4741.9400000000005s)]
*  that we have to pay this loan back. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4743.54s)]
*  But that loan money didn't go towards profiting us. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4744.74s)]
*  It essentially went towards sustaining us. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4747.900000000001s)]
*  We had to pay it back though. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4750.46s)]
*  That loan to Pelosi, the $5 million that she makes, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4751.9400000000005s)]
*  it comes in as income. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4755.34s)]
*  You don't have to pay it back [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4757.78s)]
*  because it's just so messed up. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4758.820000000001s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4761.78s)]
*  Yeah, it's, again, I don't come from any of this stuff. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4762.66s)]
*  I know nothing about the politics [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4767.1s)]
*  and how it was before we started tracking. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4769.14s)]
*  And it just shocks me of like these rules for the [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4770.74s)]
*  and not for me to the every single aspect of our lives. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4774.18s)]
*  You should be shocked by it. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4779.42s)]
*  You should fight against it. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4780.54s)]
*  You are, I hope you get, ironically, I hope you get rich. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4781.62s)]
*  And I really appreciate that explanation. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4785.9800000000005s)]
*  It was even more interesting than I thought. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4788.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4789.5s)]
*  Thank you. Appreciate it. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4790.34s)]
*  Thank you again for having me on. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4791.18s)]
*  Dude, you're one of the reasons I like social media. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4792.3s)]
*  Whenever I think, oh, social media is turning everyone trans [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4794.26s)]
*  and it's bad, then I see what you do. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4796.46s)]
*  And I'm like, no, it's actually, there are some great things. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4798.46s)]
*  And it's not just us. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4801.700000000001s)]
*  I think Elon with X saved everything [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4802.62s)]
*  because we had a Pelosi tracker on Metta banned. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4806.22s)]
*  They banned it? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4809.26s)]
*  Banned the first week. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4810.34s)]
*  Why? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4811.780000000001s)]
*  I think in their disclaimer and stuff, whatnot, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4812.62s)]
*  they said they can't use the name Pelosi tracker. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4816.3s)]
*  You can't criticize any politician from the Bay area [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4818.38s)]
*  where they're based. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4820.54s)]
*  Yeah. And so we then created [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4821.38s)]
*  and we did the politician trade tracker. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4822.66s)]
*  So we're on Instagram now, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4824.42s)]
*  but Elon with X in the citizen journalism that's going on, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4825.78s)]
*  I think that's like the biggest thing that I get, [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4830.9s)]
*  I'm proud of is like, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4833.58s)]
*  in the weather, these news, CNNs, Fox news, NBCs, [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4836.22s)]
*  and I don't know how they're going to adapt to it, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4839.3s)]
*  but they have to figure out a way to [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4841.62s)]
*  hit the masses through social media. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4844.74s)]
*  And the best people at it are these citizen journalists [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4848.34s)]
*  on X that are doing all this work [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4851.34s)]
*  that are uncovering these stories. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4853.34s)]
*  They may not have all the facts. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4855.26s)]
*  They may not be a hundred percent right. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4856.5s)]
*  There's probably some grifters out there, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4858.26s)]
*  but at the end of the day, the conversation is being had [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4860.18s)]
*  and it's a step in the right direction. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4862.46s)]
*  Oh, it's wonderful. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4864.46s)]
*  Everything about it is wonderful. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4865.54s)]
*  Thank you for taking this time. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4866.66s)]
*  Thank you, appreciate it. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4867.5s)]
*  I do. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4868.34s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4870.06s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4873.06s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4874.66s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4875.5s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4877.22s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy and our politics [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4879.18s)]
*  with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4882.700000000001s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4885.58s)]
*  rather than more. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4888.58s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4890.1s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4892.14s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4893.46s)]
*  Well, we could wind up with a bunch of people [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4894.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, we could wind about it. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4898.06s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4899.620000000001s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4900.780000000001s)]
*  or we could find a way around it. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4901.820000000001s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4903.14s)]
*  not intentionally deceptive. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4906.38s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4908.14s)]
*  we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4909.780000000001s)]
*  Subscribe, hit the little bell icon to be notified [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4911.700000000001s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4914.700000000001s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4917.06s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4919.22s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7j2HdPuUys&t=4922.18s)]
