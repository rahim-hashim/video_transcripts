# Ryan Salame Facing Prison for Donating to Trump, His Journey With SBF, & Why the Banks Hate Crypto
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys)
*  So I feel like kind of an idiot as someone who is watching from afar this case [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=0.0s)]
*  That I it never really occurred to me that the way it was prosecuted would be determined by politics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5.28s)]
*  But of course because the justice system is inherently political now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  It's openly political and we're in an election year where Trump is running [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=15.72s)]
*  So I was interested to note in reading about it and in our breakfast that we just had [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=18.92s)]
*  That you were not indicted [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=24.92s)]
*  You're about to go away for seven and a half years to federal prison but not for financial crimes fundamentally for campaign finance violations [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=27.040000000000003s)]
*  And so in one sentence, let me tell you the overview from my perspective. Correct me if I'm wrong here [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=34.58s)]
*  You have Sam Bankman Friede who's in prison for a long time, but he's not been charged with any campaign finance violations [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=40.36s)]
*  He gave it to Democrats. He helped get Biden elected you gave to Republicans and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  And you're going away on campaign finance violations is that that's correct [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=52.64s)]
*  That's correct, okay [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  So I I initially assumed that the Justice Department was not sort of a political organization [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=79.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and you know because I was new to DC I hadn't been around that much and you grew up in this country [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  Correct grew up in this country and you know, you you try to have faith in the system [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=88.88s)]
*  You try to have faith in how it all shakes out in there. I'm now realizing that it is [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=92.24s)]
*  Incredibly political but you're not going to prison for making up a fake cryptocurrency or defrauding investors [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=96.8s)]
*  No [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  in fact the Justice Department is sort of [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=103.88s)]
*  Specifically noted and stated that they know I was not aware of the central fraud so they introduced some [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=105.88s)]
*  Evidence some testimony during Sam's case that showed right up until the last minute [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=111.62s)]
*  Caroline Ellison was lying to me and to the rest of sort of people at FTX and Alameda [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=116.26s)]
*  about funds being stolen so [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=121.5s)]
*  Good that what I mean again, I'm coming at this as a non [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  Finance person just as a reader of the news, but I thought the crime at FTX was defrauding a million investors [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=128.34s)]
*  Using investor funds for things like real estate right completely agree that that is the crime that occurred [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=134.74s)]
*  But that's not what you're going to prison for correct. They you know in uncovering that crime [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=140.9s)]
*  They manufactured a lot of other crimes and intent behind them that was just not there and never existed [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=145.86s)]
*  so the two things that I've pled guilty to are [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=151.38s)]
*  operating an unlicensed money transmitting business and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  campaign finance fraud the reality is the campaign finance fraud is [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=157.62s)]
*  Everything that they wanted and then they sort of found some other things to lay at my feet and put pressure on me with so [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=161.5s)]
*  Let's just go through them what can you describe what the first crime is? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=168.78s)]
*  Yeah, so you need a money transmitting license to operate a money transmitting business in the United States [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=172.42s)]
*  Everyone is money transmitting is moving money from one place to another moving [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=178.94s)]
*  Yeah, essentially moving money one place to another I actually when I arrived at Alameda [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  I went to our lawyers and questioned whether we needed money transmitting licenses or not because I had just been at a company [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  That had money transmitting licenses [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=193.85999999999999s)]
*  So I knew of these licenses and where they were relevant and I got very specific [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=195.82s)]
*  Legal instruction from you know good lawyers that we did not need money transmitting licenses and those licenses are bestowed by the federal government [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=200.78s)]
*  I assume yeah, that's correct and state governments as well. Okay. Um [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=208.22s)]
*  Okay, so that's one [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=213.42s)]
*  Running and not getting a license a government license to move money from one place to another correct [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=215.94s)]
*  I will note that the company that I ran was we didn't touch us customers [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=221.06s)]
*  There was a separate US division that did touch us customers and they had money transmitting licenses [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=224.46s)]
*  Okay, so what how could you be indicted for that? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=231.1s)]
*  And I mean, it's a great great question [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=236.58s)]
*  Certainly, even if we needed MTL's I was not a lawyer. I sought legal advice [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=239.54s)]
*  You know the lawyers that sort of ran the company ran regulation ran the licensing [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=245.18s)]
*  Noted that this is was their responsibility [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=251.18s)]
*  But it has been laid at my feet [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=254.1s)]
*  so you're [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=256.7s)]
*  accused of not getting a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=258.58s)]
*  US government license to move the money of non US citizens, correct [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=260.58s)]
*  How can that be a crime? I've yet to have a lawyer explained to me why we needed MTL licenses [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=267.26s)]
*  Okay [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=274.9s)]
*  All right [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=275.94s)]
*  um [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=277.38s)]
*  interesting [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=278.06s)]
*  This is just sort of blowing my I mean even when I was considering doing this interview [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  I was thinking well FTX bad fraud bad [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=283.7s)]
*  We did a whole documentary on why FTX committed fraud and why they're bad, which I still think [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=285.92s)]
*  And I just didn't know that you weren't charged for any of those crimes [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=292.18s)]
*  and I don't think that most people reading the news coverage of [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=296.44s)]
*  Your pleas would understand like if you're just following Bloomberg News or Reuters would understand that you were never charged with [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=301.02s)]
*  the crimes that FTX is famous for yeah, that's that's correct [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=309.3s)]
*  I think and you know, that's a big part of why I'm here and why we're talking about it [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=313.06s)]
*  But interesting, you know, there's a lot of misconception around. Yeah many aspects of the case [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=317.5s)]
*  Well, but this isn't in the realm of opinion [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=322.5s)]
*  These are just the facts publicly available facts like what you're you were indicted for what you pled to what you're being sentenced for [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=324.62s)]
*  Like those aren't opinions. Those are [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=331.22s)]
*  Verifiable facts. Yeah, that's correct [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=333.94s)]
*  And none of these charges are in any way defrauding any individual or taking money from them or stealing from them [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=335.42s)]
*  You know, I had [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=341.3s)]
*  98 ish percent of my net worth on the platform if I thought Sam was stealing money [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=343.21999999999997s)]
*  I know I would not have left all my money on FTX. It wouldn't make any sense [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=347.94s)]
*  Okay, so that's you [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=352.5s)]
*  Committed a crime that doesn't seem to be a crime logically, but whatever and then they're the campaign finance violations [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=355.14s)]
*  The campaign finance violations are because I borrowed money from Alameda [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=361.38s)]
*  Which was Sam's company that he owned private company [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=367.06s)]
*  No investors all just lent money [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=369.58s)]
*  But I borrowed money and then I went and did a lot of things with that money and one of the big things I did [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=371.5s)]
*  Was get involved in political contributions, right? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=375.78s)]
*  But you know, I also bought like a house with that money. I lived off that money. So [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=378.65999999999997s)]
*  the sort of the real story there is when I decided to get involved in politics and take a lot of money off of the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=384.17999999999995s)]
*  FTX platform I again went to our legal counsel [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=390.22s)]
*  I said look I'm gonna sell off a large chunk of the money that I have on the platform [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=393.22s)]
*  This is various crypto tokens. This is I think I had some equity. I was looking at selling [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=397.42s)]
*  I was I was gonna cash out essentially [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=401.54s)]
*  And the lawyers advised that that is not the way to do it [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=403.74s)]
*  The proper way to do it would be to borrow the money against these holdings [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=406.86s)]
*  It's a tax advantageous strategy. It's not a crime. It's how most people borrow [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=411.18s)]
*  When they have sort of a large pool of equity, it's how a lot of prominent people get money out [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=416.84s)]
*  And I would say right around 100% actually [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, well the lawyers advise it, you know you go to lawyers [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=425.52s)]
*  You don't want to get hit on the gains because correct, correct. It will eventually be taxed. It's it's right [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=428.28s)]
*  It's just you've got a little basis on this stuff [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=433.64s)]
*  You know, right you took possession of these assets when they were worth much less than they're worth now, correct [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=436.28s)]
*  And so you borrow against it to cash out correct and then I use a bunch of that money to get involved in the political [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=442.44s)]
*  So I but I just even before you did I just want to confirm that that is not not only is that not unusual [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=448.71999999999997s)]
*  That is the standard correct for people in your position. Correct. I happen to know that so yeah [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=454.14s)]
*  Yeah, and accountants advise it lawyers advise. I mean it is you know what you're told to do [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=458.88s)]
*  That is a hundred percent true. Yeah, whether you agree with our system or tax system. It doesn't matter. That is what everybody does [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=463.64s)]
*  Legitimate people so [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=470.4s)]
*  Okay, so then but the problem that you ran into arose from the fact that you use some of that money to give political campaign [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=472.71999999999997s)]
*  Contributions, correct. Okay. So what did that consist of I believe in total I donated about 20 to 30 million [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=478.44s)]
*  throughout the cycle [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=485.47999999999996s)]
*  to Republican candidates [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=487.35999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so anywhere from your PACs to individual donations to specific candidates up to the I think it was [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=489.47999999999996s)]
*  2800 [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  limit and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=497.59999999999997s)]
*  What percentage of that money went to Republicans a hundred percent of the money I gave went to Republicans [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  I've always been a Republican [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=505.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's just the party that makes the most sense for a plethora of reasons at this point, right? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=509.08000000000004s)]
*  But those it's consistent with your beliefs. This is my beliefs. It's rare to be I think young in tech [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=514.36s)]
*  And a Republican so it's a lot of why I you know got involved [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=519.96s)]
*  But yes [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=524.08s)]
*  At the same time Sam Bankman freed famously was contributing to politicians as well, correct he was running [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=525.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he was giving primarily to Democrats though. He was doing some dark to Republicans as well [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=532.4s)]
*  How much did he give to Democrats? I? [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=537.74s)]
*  Don't know the exact numbers. I want to say we're close to 60 to 70 million in total Wow [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=540.56s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So one of the biggest donors in the cycle. I think he was second or third. Yeah in the 2020 cycle [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=545.16s)]
*  That's correct [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=550.56s)]
*  And he has not been indicted for campaign finance violations [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=551.8s)]
*  That's correct. He was not indicted on the campaign finance violations only two of us got in trouble for campaign finance [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=555.28s)]
*  And that was Nishad Singh who was part of the central fraud and myself [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=560.92s)]
*  hmm, so he gave publicly anyway to Democrats you [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=565.4799999999999s)]
*  Gave to Republicans much less, but you get indicted. He doesn't that's correct [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=570.8s)]
*  Hmm. How do you think that works? I? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=576.16s)]
*  You know, I've I don't understand how all of this works anymore [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=578.88s)]
*  So I don't know what to what to say to that, but it's strange especially especially since [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=582.28s)]
*  You know, he was the central political figure sort of this is yeah [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=589.0s)]
*  Um, huh [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=596.9599999999999s)]
*  What was your crime exactly [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=599.72s)]
*  My crime was they accused me of being a straw donor for Sam Begman freed [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=602.04s)]
*  So I was only doing I was taking his money and spreading it out [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=606.4s)]
*  Because it was borrowed from Alameda, but it was your money though [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=611.84s)]
*  Well, I was borrowed against my money and it would have been my money had I not gone to the lawyers and asked them the [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=615.28s)]
*  Appropriate way to to take money out. Yes [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=620.88s)]
*  Okay, so I mean [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=623.72s)]
*  Is that I'm just confused by the concept a little bit if I [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=626.5200000000001s)]
*  You know if my net worth is mostly borrowed which is in the case that's true for a lot of people [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=633.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I donate to a political campaign. Is that a straw contribution? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  It was in this case [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=643.1600000000001s)]
*  It was considered a straw. Have you ever heard of that before? No. No, I mean the the sort of [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=645.44s)]
*  The thing I have to wrap my head right there has to be a why right you have to ask why for for anything [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=651.24s)]
*  I don't know why I would make something a crime that didn't need to be [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=655.6s)]
*  Right. It doesn't what does that mean? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=660.32s)]
*  Like if I had just sold off my crypto and contributed the way I initially wanted to and plan to there is no crime [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=663.5600000000001s)]
*  But because I sort of went listened and borrowed the money [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=670.76s)]
*  The way I was advised to they've now [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=674.24s)]
*  So it doesn't seem to make any sense these charges actually [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=676.28s)]
*  Yes, I would agree with the fact that they don't and I was you know [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=681.2s)]
*  I was very close to going to trial the government's came comes up with creative ways to get you to not go to trial [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=685.24s)]
*  And they came up with a very smart way to get me to avoid trial, which was what? [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  They told me that if I pled to go to trial [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=695.48s)]
*  I would be able to get a very good deal of money [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=697.96s)]
*  I mean, you know, as well as I'd an investigation can destroy your life regardless of whether you're innocent or guilty [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=700.84s)]
*  So they threatened the mother of the child? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=707.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=709.76s)]
*  And they said that if I pleaded guilty to these two crimes, they would not pursue my loved ones and looking at anything that they had done [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=710.88s)]
*  Or investigating them [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=718.72s)]
*  Your loved ones. Yeah, the mother of my child [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=720.72s)]
*  Is she a criminal no no, absolutely not [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=725.2s)]
*  So they threatened the mother of your child in order to get you to plead to things that were not self-evidently crimes, correct [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=728.84s)]
*  What did your lawyers say? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=736.44s)]
*  My lawyers are pretty surprised by it. They were they said this inducement was incredibly strong [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=738.24s)]
*  Not something that they had ever done when they were prosecutors and not something that they had [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=743.24s)]
*  expected [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=747.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, they said it's it's up to me. I mean I they present all the information to you [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=750.6s)]
*  It's a very odd process for anyone who's never gone through an investigation, which I assume is most people you never speak directly to the prosecutors [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=754.68s)]
*  It's all through lawyers who then give you sort of a readout of what's going on [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=761.0s)]
*  You know and they lay out your options, right? So if I went to trial it was a jury in [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=765.92s)]
*  New York [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=771.12s)]
*  I'm a Republican [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=772.52s)]
*  Heterosexual white male had accumulated a fair bit of money. The jury's not gonna love me already [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=774.6s)]
*  So they did lawyers tell you that yeah, they lay that out, you know [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=780.44s)]
*  The lawyers will tell you that even if you're completely innocent [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=783.84s)]
*  It is hard to win at trial the government has all because of your demographic profile demographic profile and the government controls the entire narrative [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=786.72s)]
*  You know people are scared. No one's gonna get up and testify in my defense [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=794.44s)]
*  They're scared that the government's gonna go after them if they do [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=797.16s)]
*  You know, this is a big problem. I had with Sam Baker and Fried's trial [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=800.08s)]
*  I'm not saying he's innocent by far [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=803.08s)]
*  But you know, I watched it and thought had I you know [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=804.8s)]
*  I if I'd been on the defense for him a lot of that stuff was just not accurate the way they were describing it [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=808.12s)]
*  But no one got up to counter any of the government's narrative because then you know [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=812.84s)]
*  You get threatened with more time in prison [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=817.6s)]
*  like you say one wrong thing on the stand in defense of someone and [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=819.76s)]
*  They will get you for perjury or your lawyers will tell you this so [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=823.64s)]
*  I flirted with the idea of being on the defense for Sam not because I thought he was innocent of [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  Everything you know that they accused but [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=833.88s)]
*  There was no one up there providing a counter narrative to this narrative that the government had spun up and that's not how the justice [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=837.0400000000001s)]
*  Supposed to work now. So I I note this to my lawyers and the lawyers, you know [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=843.44s)]
*  Said you could face an extra ten years for doing that. Like do you really want to sort of risk that? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=847.6s)]
*  you know, it was clear Sam was going to lose ultimately and I'm not saying that's wrong, but [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=853.2s)]
*  It's not the way the system is supposed to work [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=858.6400000000001s)]
*  You know the government hands get out of jail free cards [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=860.6400000000001s)]
*  If you parrot the narrative that they want and then the you know, everyone who would provide any counterpoint is frightened [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=862.6400000000001s)]
*  It's just it's [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  That's not justice. It's an odd version of it. It's not an American version of it [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=872.8000000000001s)]
*  It's not the point of our whole American system on it [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=878.0400000000001s)]
*  You know trials also going to be 10 to I think was 8 10 12 million dollars [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=881.8000000000001s)]
*  Most of my money was gone locked up on FTX. So, you know, I was operating from [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=887.16s)]
*  Substantially less beans and I had before [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=892.36s)]
*  You know, I don't know how anyone I don't know how anyone does it and you can't just go out and get a job [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=894.88s)]
*  No, can't go out and get a job. I mean, I'm not gonna make 10 million dollars overnight to defend myself. So [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=899.8399999999999s)]
*  You know and the inducement I think was the ultimate decision-maker [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=905.8399999999999s)]
*  I'm putting the mother of your child in prison, right? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=909.56s)]
*  I mean you can get me to plead guilty to anything if that's on the table [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=911.76s)]
*  They were explicit yeah, yeah, thanks. I mean they explained the government's careful, right? I mean, I'm I'll say that I think today or tomorrow [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=914.72s)]
*  I'm gonna file an appeal [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=921.9200000000001s)]
*  to my [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=924.44s)]
*  guilty plea [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=925.8000000000001s)]
*  Because the the government has now continued to pursue [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=927.8000000000001s)]
*  the mother of my child despite [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=932.32s)]
*  Saying that they wouldn't if I pled guilty so I'm gonna use that an attempt an appeal wait [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=934.96s)]
*  So they got you to plead by threatening the person you love [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=940.12s)]
*  With indictment and so you pled on the basis of their promise that they would not indict her [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=945.84s)]
*  Correct, not even not indict not investigate. They would drop the investigation or any investigation into her if I pled [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=952.72s)]
*  What did she do wrong? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=960.04s)]
*  We we are not married currently [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=961.72s)]
*  And we are not married currently [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=965.4s)]
*  We are not married currently and we shared finances and [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=967.4s)]
*  So they're accusing her of also a campaign finance fraud violation because our finances are commingled and intermixed [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=972.12s)]
*  So so your lawyers told you if you do this you're basically doing it for the mother of your child [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=981.72s)]
*  She will not be hassled they'll leave her alone that's correct [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=991.56s)]
*  I mean and they went further than that they sort of put her her case into cold storage [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=994.92s)]
*  Which you know, they they didn't have her [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=999.2s)]
*  Plead the fifth during times as she should have she's also going through a sort of difficult divorce proceeding [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1002.16s)]
*  Which is why you're not married, which is why we're not married. So [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1006.52s)]
*  You know, she should have pled the fifth during things for that [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1010.04s)]
*  Everyone thought the investigation was dropped into her because of this inducement and then what happened and then we found out I [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1012.8s)]
*  Don't know a few months ago that it is not [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1020.44s)]
*  They have continued to pursue investigating her they don't acknowledge the inducement as being real and they're going to charge her [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1023.1600000000001s)]
*  The inducement being their promise not to do this correct on the basis of which you pled guilty correct to crimes that are not actually crimes [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1031.64s)]
*  Correct, right and then so they said they wouldn't hassle her and then once you pled they indicted her anyway, correct [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1040.28s)]
*  Well, yeah year when a year later year and a half later. Why do you think they did that? I [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1046.54s)]
*  Don't know it doesn't make any sense to me [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1050.74s)]
*  So I mean just if you zoom out a little bit if you lie to a federal agent, that's a felony. Yes [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1053.94s)]
*  But if a federal prosecutor lies to you, it's fine [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1060.14s)]
*  That's correct. And I think they know the public narrative around FTX is so terrible, you know that they control the narrative, right? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1063.74s)]
*  No one talks to the media more than [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1070.22s)]
*  The prosecutors and the government even though they sort of lock people up on the other side if they talk to the media the government sort [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1072.06s)]
*  Controls the narrative publicly right so they know how bad the FTX story is and how little the public wants to even think about any [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1077.94s)]
*  aspect of it anymore [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1084.5s)]
*  So I think that emboldens them to just sort of do whatever they want [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1087.06s)]
*  How much should you spend on lawyers in this process? I've spent five or six million in totals so far on lawyers, correct [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1090.6200000000001s)]

*  Yeah, people feel that way for sure. Yeah [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1214.94s)]
*  But there's no hint of that in your case. There's the opposite [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1217.8600000000001s)]
*  There's literally Caroline Ellison who was sort of the central to this entire thing [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1221.98s)]

*  Interview sort of to the company, but you know right after it collapsed noting that it was her Gary Nishan [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1259.6s)]
*  Sam that has sort of orchestrated this large [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1265.4799999999998s)]
*  Theft or use of customer funds in an inappropriate way [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1268.8799999999999s)]

*  But this chick who has admitted being part of the fraud is not facing prison [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1282.52s)]
*  We don't she might go sometime. She's certainly not going as of right now as of right now correct [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1287.72s)]
*  What do you think of that? [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1293.22s)]
*  you know I [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1295.52s)]
*  Know what to think you've reached some level of Zen acceptance here [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1297.6000000000001s)]
*  That's sort of you enter this Twilight Zone in the whole process [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1300.56s)]
*  You know where like reality isn't a thing anymore, and you either cope with it or you go mad so [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1303.3999999999999s)]
*  Coping with it [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1310.1599999999999s)]
*  Now what about so Sam Bankman freed? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1311.62s)]
*  So you just listed the officers of the of the company, but Sam Bankman freed was [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1314.84s)]
*  Heavily involved with his parents both attorneys once an ethics professor. I believe correct [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1320.12s)]
*  Who seemed remarkably sleazy on the bitch? I'm just judging from the from the emails that came to light [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1326.28s)]
*  greedy [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1331.52s)]
*  Pushing for more money more real estate whatever and then his brother Gabe [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1332.96s)]
*  Have any of them? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1337.2800000000002s)]
*  Pled guilty to anything no no one else was charged outside of the central for and myself and now [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1339.24s)]
*  You know Michelle so none of the bankman freed family has faced any legal consequences from this [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1346.0400000000002s)]
*  They're not correct or any of the lawyers that advised a substantial amount of this [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1352.2800000000002s)]
*  I mean in both of my fact patterns the lawyers were heavily heavily involved. You know they make I [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1356.1200000000001s)]
*  Forgave it was my lawyer that said it [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1362.0s)]
*  But it's he said you can't go ask your lawyer if you can shoot someone in the head have them say yes [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1363.88s)]
*  And then shoot them right that's not a defensive. You can't say that lawyer told me I could do this so I did it [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1367.48s)]
*  But I don't know what the point of the lawyer is then right if I go to the lawyer and say is this sort of? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1373.24s)]
*  MTL legal or is this campaign finance what thing we're doing legal and they say yes [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1379.36s)]
*  You know what am I just supposed to be a lawyer like this is their purpose [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1384.56s)]
*  This is the whole reason I you know you go to them or you talk to them or you ask them these questions, so [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1387.92s)]
*  It's frustrating [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1393.16s)]
*  To be in trouble for things that you [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1394.96s)]
*  Genuinely try to do legally and feel like you went the route you were supposed to to do them legally [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1397.44s)]
*  Also, I mean if you you know if you're getting indicted for not having the US government [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1402.96s)]
*  Licensed to transfer the funds of people who are not US citizens outside of the United States like that's insane like who would ever imagine? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1408.8200000000002s)]
*  That you would be indicted for that it's correct. Yeah, I I couldn't imagine I mean could I? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1416.0s)]
*  Know could the FBI arrest a driver in Abu Dhabi for not having a US driver's license like I [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1422.32s)]
*  Think at this point the government just does whatever it wants anywhere in the world [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1428.3999999999999s)]
*  Think you're on to something. I think you're getting warmer there ran [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1432.48s)]
*  Wow, okay, so it just gives it's just very interesting who gets punished in this and I'll just confess my ignorance once again [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1436.24s)]
*  You know I read SPFs getting 25 years in prison. That's a long ass hard time [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1444.28s)]
*  I feel feel bad for anybody facing 25 years in prison, but it's like kind of case closed right at that point [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1448.88s)]
*  Justice has been done [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1454.92s)]
*  But I don't see how his family escaped [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1456.84s)]
*  Indictment I don't get that [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1460.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I don't want more people in I'm not saying you do but I mean [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1462.08s)]
*  I don't know how a lot of people sort of avoided this and I don't know how I ended up in the hot seat [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1465.84s)]
*  You know it's the it's the Republican donations for sure at this point [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1472.28s)]
*  But it's very strange and disheartening. So what did the lawyers tell because seven and a half years? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1476.3600000000001s)]
*  I don't want to rub it in I feel so sad for you, but that well that's real [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1482.1200000000001s)]
*  You know it's not six weeks in the drunk tank. No, that's correct [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1486.16s)]
*  And it is more time than even the prosecutors requested so the prosecutors push for five to seven years [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1489.2s)]
*  We push for 18 months the sort of standard playbook is typically you know they'll split that down the middle [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1495.76s)]
*  um [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1501.84s)]
*  Seven and a half years was more than anyone asked for except. How did you wind up with that? [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1503.04s)]
*  You know the the judge read me a whole statement [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1507.76s)]
*  He sort of indicated tell us who the judge was it was judge Kaplan [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1511.2s)]
*  He had just finished with Trump's I think the Gino Carroll case. I think I was a week after [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1514.6s)]
*  You know he spent the first half of the comments to me talking about how he disliked Citizens United [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1520.56s)]
*  So I knew I was in trouble at that point what did were you involved in the Citizens United decision? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1524.84s)]
*  No, no, and it's legal to be clear so once it started there though [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1530.52s)]
*  I knew we were off to this is a Supreme Court decision correct you did not argue that before the Supreme Court correct [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1535.4s)]
*  You didn't work for Citizens United correct. What does that have to do with you? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1542.16s)]
*  That's the beginning of you know him talking to me [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1546.3799999999999s)]
*  He goes into a lengthy discussion about how America's losing faith in its political system [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1548.9s)]
*  You know I you know what he was trying to say [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1553.94s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1557.16s)]
*  He's a judge he's been on the bench a long time judge Kaplan [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1558.76s)]
*  I know this is all I know about him. You know throughout the the plea process they [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1562.08s)]
*  You know [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1567.72s)]
*  My lawyers told me what Kaplan really cares about is acceptance of responsibility [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1569.08s)]
*  If you want to minimize the amount of time that you're gonna serve the most important thing is to just get up take responsibility [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1572.76s)]
*  Own it describe how you are responsible [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1579.2s)]
*  Apologize say you'll do better going forward so we didn't sort of that's all I did I made this whole you know [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1583.0s)]
*  Apology speech and everything and I'm genuinely sorry for all the customers of FTX. So there's not nothing there [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1589.08s)]
*  You know, it's a real, you know, what happened to them is horrific and haunts me daily [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1595.6s)]
*  but [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1601.56s)]
*  You know in front of that sort of the whole speech we put together was geared toward that but Kaplan sort of grabbed all these [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1603.72s)]
*  Things that just weren't true and started listing them off to me, right? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1609.76s)]
*  So he said I ran to the Bahamian regulators to save myself [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1612.58s)]
*  That's not true the Bahamian regulators emailed Sam and I asking what was going on Sam was busy with the collapse of the company [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1615.92s)]
*  So I got on with the regulators and told them what I was learning about in real time [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1622.48s)]
*  But sort of the judge spinned it that I ran to the Bahamian regulators to save myself [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1627.32s)]
*  I did manage to withdraw some money from FTX [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1632.68s)]
*  It was before I knew that it was gonna be [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1637.56s)]
*  File bankruptcy [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1640.1999999999998s)]
*  So everyone else is withdrawing [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1641.52s)]
*  I also withdrew a little bit just enough to cover legal fees because I had no money in the bank [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1643.0s)]
*  He twisted that as me sort of [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1647.1999999999998s)]
*  Getting out before all the customers. I think he said, you know, your point was to hell with the customers [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1649.72s)]
*  I'll save myself. But may I ask you weren't charged with that, correct? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1654.32s)]
*  That has nothing to do with the charges you pled to that's correct [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1658.9199999999998s)]
*  So that's like saying, you know [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1665.1000000000001s)]
*  You were drunk at a dinner party three years ago and I found you obnoxious therefore more jail time for you [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1666.8600000000001s)]
*  Like what does that have to do with the the crime? Yeah, the whole thing was odd the whole experience [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, that's insane. And he said this in open court [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1677.06s)]
*  Yeah, this is this his final statement to me as he you know was about to tell me that I was gonna do seven and a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1679.3400000000001s)]
*  half years [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1684.54s)]
*  You know, he described me as part of the mastermind behind this campaign finance fraud scheme that we were all involved in [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1686.26s)]
*  You know, which is crazy [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1693.1s)]
*  Alright, it's tough to stay me you stand there. You're listening to this. You can't say anything. Why? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1696.26s)]
*  It's the court, you know, you're in the courtroom. You're there to listen and then he gives a judge [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1700.98s)]
*  You have to feign respect for people judge Kaplan course. Yeah, I don't I have no respect. Yeah, sorry [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1704.98s)]
*  How so your but your lawyers sounds like did not prepare you for this at all? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1711.1799999999998s)]
*  No, the lawyers expect I mean they do the maximum was 10. It was zero to 10 [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1716.2199999999998s)]
*  It's up to the judge almost indiscriminately what they want to do [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1720.94s)]
*  But the standard procedure here would have been to basically split the time we requested and the time the prosecutors [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1723.98s)]
*  Requested and at worse what the prosecutors requested. It's almost unheard of to go above [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1729.42s)]
*  Even what the prosecutors want [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1735.6200000000001s)]
*  Did your lawyers apologize to you? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1738.7s)]
*  No, they don't they don't apologize. I mean they always they're always caveatting their statements, right? [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1740.8600000000001s)]
*  It's always it could go this way could go that way. This isn't an exact science [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1745.42s)]
*  Were any of the lawyers at FTX charged with anything no [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1749.78s)]
*  Really? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1753.66s)]
*  It almost sounds like a system designed by and for the benefit of lawyers [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1754.7s)]
*  I'm just kind of throwing it is a hundred percent of system designed for to benefit the lawyers. I mean all of it is [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1759.02s)]
*  You know the bankruptcy team is about to take a billion dollars in fees [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1764.94s)]
*  For a company that has enough money to pay back customers that doesn't mean Sam did nothing wrong [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1769.46s)]
*  But there is money in this whole system to pay back customers 120% and would have been even more [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1774.34s)]
*  Had a number of sort of more intelligent things been done [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1781.54s)]
*  But the lawyers got to the trough first and just stole the money themselves. They take it [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1785.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean they keep describing this [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1789.8799999999999s)]
*  Massive massive organization with no accountants. No nothing. I mean that wasn't true [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1791.82s)]
*  There was a whole accounting department [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1796.3s)]
*  The accounting department was hiring more people and the company's only three years old [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1797.8999999999999s)]
*  Was only three years old and just had meteoric growth from basically the beginning so hiring people was a catch-up [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1801.8000000000002s)]
*  You know every week you try to hire someone you got to interview them. They got to come [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1808.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, you're now a week behind in work [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1812.5s)]
*  There's an attempt by every department that I was aware of and involved in to hire good people and build out [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1814.3000000000002s)]
*  But but you're describing the aftermath and like how do we make the investors hold? [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1821.88s)]
*  This whole scandal is predicated on the fact that investors were defrauded [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1826.64s)]
*  They lost their money because the money was misused that that's the core allegation. That's the crime, right? Right? So [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1829.84s)]
*  The injured party [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1837.9199999999998s)]
*  Is the investors correct or the users of FTX who had their phones on there? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1839.9599999999998s)]
*  Right. Yeah, but the people whose money was taken by FTX for okay, but the lawyers wind up with a billion dollars [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1845.0s)]
*  Yeah, and then all of the individuals lawyers that we've hired [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1852.3999999999999s)]
*  But why would why would they get a billion dollars that's in bankruptcy the lawyers typically make out the bankruptcy lawyers make out phenomenally well [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1856.16s)]
*  You know, they kind of have indiscriminate ability to do whatever they want [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1865.28s)]
*  You're acting like that's normal this sounds like a disease bankruptcy laws wildly horrific [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1871.68s)]
*  And it benefits just the the parasites the lawyers [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1878.04s)]
*  Correct and they also have the power to intimidate a lot of people [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1881.88s)]
*  I mean a lot of people aren't speaking up about the FTX situation because they're still waiting to settle with the bankruptcy estate [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1885.0s)]
*  and so the bankruptcy lawyers in conjunction with the [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1890.96s)]
*  Government keep everyone silent [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1895.44s)]
*  And by the way, as you just said no lawyers were indicted so like all the hyenas are on the same team it feels like [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1899.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's a it's a problem. It's a systemic issue [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1906.52s)]
*  That you know, I don't know how it gets addressed [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1910.24s)]
*  So how involved again my knowledge of this is just purely from stupid wire stories on it [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1913.24s)]
*  But how involved was Sam Bankman Fried's family in this very involved? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1919.28s)]
*  His mother was only involved in the political side. How was she involved in the political side? She ran her own political organization [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1925.76s)]
*  I think it was called mind the gap [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1932.3799999999999s)]
*  And then his father was involved in the company was part of hiring lawyers was part of advising on tax treatment [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1934.9s)]
*  You know [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1941.98s)]
*  Yeah, his father was heavily involved. So the mother was using FTX money to help Democratic politicians, correct [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1943.22s)]
*  But that's not a campaign finance violation I [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1950.74s)]
*  Don't know what you want me to say [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1956.38s)]
*  It's just it's so [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1959.3400000000001s)]
*  It's just great it [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1962.2600000000002s)]
*  Just parenthetically [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1965.18s)]
*  it's just one of those stories and I've seen so many in 30 years where you have these perceptions because you don't really know anything beyond what [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1966.3000000000002s)]
*  You know you saw in a headline or in the first four graphs the New York Times story [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1973.22s)]
*  And then when you press a little bit into the details [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1976.7800000000002s)]
*  it's something totally different from what you thought it was or what you were told it was and [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1979.2600000000002s)]
*  It's like a complete scam that benefits the same people always [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1984.14s)]
*  You know the lawyers the Democratic donors the Democratic politicians and the people and [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1988.22s)]
*  You know a tragedy like this tragedy for the investors is hijacked by these institutions for political reasons [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=1994.38s)]
*  I mean that that's what I see after talking to you this morning. Yeah, it's yeah [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2001.5800000000002s)]
*  No, it's it's terrible to be a part of yeah [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2005.94s)]
*  I mean you're losing everything at once and then you know [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2008.7800000000002s)]
*  This whole narrative is being spun up around you that you have no real control over [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2011.7s)]
*  And then it just becomes your reality or you go crazy [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2016.46s)]
*  Well, I'd probably go crazy yeah, yeah, I'm bordering on it [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2021.02s)]
*  Following my ex-posts some I'm right on I'm right on the edge of sanity [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2026.22s)]
*  Yeah, so what and tell me and then I want to ask about your life, and how you wound up in all of this but um [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2030.26s)]
*  Gabe Bankman Fried who's he Sam's younger brother? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2036.66s)]
*  Yeah, and he was actually the one who introduced me to getting really involved on the in politics [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2039.46s)]
*  He was running a pandemic prevention initiative that was actually it was a decent idea [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2045.3s)]
*  You know [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2051.62s)]
*  COVID was ridiculous the shutdowns were insane the whole way it was handled was wild but and [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2052.8199999999997s)]
*  Not great, but what we saw was like a single [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2058.9s)]
*  You know thing created anywhere in the world will just spread everywhere and we are clearly not prepared for anything of the matter [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2062.18s)]
*  So a real biosecurity threat the government's not prepared for yeah [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2068.5s)]
*  And you know covid was I think a joke and i'm sorry to anyone that lost anyone but for a global pandemic [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2072.66s)]
*  Covid was as light as it's going to get but that doesn't mean there's not the potential, you know for an actual bio weapon. That's for sure [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2077.22s)]
*  And so his initiative was to sort of put in place preparations for that now get text get testing of future vaccines now [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2083.94s)]
*  Create sort of you know ways in the united states not externally [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2093.14s)]
*  To prevent these sorts of things going forward [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2097.54s)]
*  It seems like a fine idea is a brilliant idea there was a hundreds of millions of dollars of unspent covid dollars that were just sitting out there [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2099.54s)]
*  This was a great use for them. You know, they'd already been allocated. It's not new spending [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2104.58s)]
*  It was a brilliant idea and it really to me. It was very is real altruism [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2109.22s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of people that do a lot of fake altruism like this was a great idea [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2114.02s)]
*  So this is actually what drove a lot of my [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2118.82s)]
*  Republican giving he sort of got me excited about [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2121.7799999999997s)]
*  Helping with the pandemic and he was very excited about it [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2125.38s)]
*  Helping with this from the republican side [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2129.0600000000004s)]
*  So and then that was all twisted. I mean that was all turned into I was only giving to push crypto policy united states [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2131.0600000000004s)]
*  Which is just not the case at all [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2137.78s)]
*  Oh [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2140.5800000000004s)]

*  Campaign finance experts of everything lawyers. Was he part of partisan? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2147.84s)]

*  Not really they're associated with the democratic party [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2155.08s)]
*  I think because he was because of his mother, um, but they're just strategists was the mother partisan. Do you think yeah? Yes [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2157.16s)]

*  You know fell into the job at ey because I had sort of I work hard and yeah push myself forward. Um [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2214.3599999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I but I found and discovered bitcoin and I fell in love with it [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2222.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought it was one of the coolest things i'd ever discovered. Um, I thought you know in a world where [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2225.3999999999996s)]
*  Trusting people doesn't always work out as i've learned. Yeah trusting math does work [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2231.3199999999997s)]
*  And the whole system's built on math working [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  So I thought it was amazing this global transfer network that works as long as math works that can't be sort of [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2238.1200000000003s)]
*  perverted in its base core [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2243.6400000000003s)]
*  Brilliant, I thought it was incredible. Um, so I started publicly talking about it on linkedin [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2246.28s)]
*  This is the time at linkedin was becoming a big deal. Um, and a crypto company in boston that needed an accountant [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2249.8s)]
*  Uh found me and asked me if i'd go work for them [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2255.96s)]
*  What company circle so they run usdc now, um, which is a stable coin [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2259.0s)]
*  Uh, they're one of the sort of older stable coin companies [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2264.12s)]
*  And they were one of the original companies to have an app that you could buy bitcoin like a sort of venmo [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2267.48s)]
*  Yes, but that was I think 15 or 16 [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2272.7599999999998s)]
*  So you're going to work for them as an accountant [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2276.36s)]
*  I go to work to them as someone who's bridging the trading desk and the accounts [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2278.36s)]
*  So the accountants have no idea what the traders are doing because they don't really understand crypto or sort of right [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2283.16s)]
*  Looking at the network very well or the exchange data and then you know [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2288.2s)]
*  The traders don't want to deal with the accountants because they're making a boatload of money trading [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2291.96s)]
*  No one cares. Of course. Everyone makes fun of accountants, right? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2296.04s)]
*  So I bridged the gap between those two. Uh, I helped them sort of reproduce a full record of transactions that had happened starting in january [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2298.76s)]
*  It was an absolutely insane amount of work. Um, but the trading desk was pleased because then they could pass audit [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2306.92s)]
*  Um, and they brought me on the trading desk full time [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2312.28s)]
*  In boston in boston. Yep, and then they moved me to hong kong because it's uh, crypto markets are 24 7 [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2315.64s)]
*  So they moved me to hong kong to uh, sort of run the not run the desk but work on the desk overnight [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2321.56s)]
*  Um, and that's where I eventually met sam [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2327.3999999999996s)]
*  Huh? [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2330.6s)]
*  How'd you meet sam bankman for you sam was at a conference? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2331.7999999999997s)]
*  And he was it was just alameda research at the time and he was alameda research was headlining the conference with an exchange called [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2336.2s)]
*  Binance, which is the biggest crypto exchange and no one had really heard of alameda [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2342.66s)]
*  but for binance to be willing to headline a conference with [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2347.24s)]
*  These people they had to be a big deal right because binance is not going to let some small irrelevant firm [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2350.7599999999998s)]
*  headline a conference with them [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2356.12s)]
*  Um, and so I saw sam speaking on stage. I got a meeting with him [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2358.04s)]
*  Um, and just you know, I knew he was going to be successful. What'd you think of him? [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2362.04s)]
*  He's I mean, he's brilliant. Um, he you know, he's autistic [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2367.16s)]

*  Um social situations are harder for him than the average person [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2377.48s)]
*  Um, he doesn't sort of I think he doesn't have an emotional spectrum that most people have. Yes [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2381.8s)]
*  Um, he you know eye contacts difficult, uh things like that sort of the the human elements of the world [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2387.56s)]
*  Don't make a lot of sense the internet digital [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2394.28s)]
*  Uh, you know money-making math world is all that makes sense to him [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2397.32s)]
*  Um, and he said he's a hard worker 24 7 slept on a bean bag [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2401.56s)]
*  You know, we used to have to tell him to go shower because he would start to smell we would buy him new shoes when they'd wear [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2406.04s)]
*  Out [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2411.0s)]
*  You know the interesting thing how did he respond when you told me he had to take a shower because he stunk [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2411.8799999999997s)]
*  He's fine. He knew he couldn't do these other things and sort of [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2416.68s)]
*  You know people took over there was almost like a really like a brotherly feeling for you feel a little bad for him when you meet [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2421.08s)]
*  Him. Yeah [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2426.68s)]
*  initially just because you know [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2427.7999999999997s)]
*  You know, it can't be easy living like that. Uh, you know, you're brilliant in one world, but you don't understand [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2429.88s)]
*  You just forget to take a shower just didn't care [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2434.6800000000003s)]
*  Interesting yeah, he all he wanted to do was work 24 7 365 [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2439.32s)]
*  It's it's like he needed it to keep going privacy is not an option. It's a human necessity [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2443.5600000000004s)]
*  It's at the core of freedom. No privacy. No freedom [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2449.1600000000003s)]
*  If you can't have privacy you are owned by someone else [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2453.4s)]
*  You're a slave and so the question is who has in 2024 more privacy? [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2457.24s)]
*  The average american or the average north korean? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2463.0s)]
*  Well, unfortunately because of technology in many ways the answer is the average north korean [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2465.8799999999997s)]
*  Has more privacy the average north korean is being monitored less than you are and the reason is really simple [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2471.56s)]
*  You're carrying around a phone and a laptop and the government and big tech can and do track both of them [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2477.64s)]
*  Endlessly again and again. We've seen that companies and governments are not afraid to use the data [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2485.3s)]
*  They glean from you to manipulate you what you purchase what you think even how you vote maybe especially how you vote [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2490.1200000000003s)]
*  So how do you get your privacy back? [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2497.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, we use a product called a vpn a virtual private network and the one we use is called express vpn [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2499.6400000000003s)]
*  Express vpn reroutes 100 of our internet activity through secure encrypted channels [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2507.7200000000003s)]
*  That means that no one has access to our online activity [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2513.3199999999997s)]
*  The original promise of the internet was freedom freedom to receive information and to express your own views [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2517.72s)]
*  You don't have that now, but express vpn [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2525.0s)]
*  Gives it back to you go to express vpn.com [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2528.44s)]

*  Watching video of him. He seems like he's on adderall or something. He seems impaired by pharmaceuticals in some way [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2550.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, he had a very strong antidepressant patch. Um, I believe it was called an m-sam patch [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2557.2400000000002s)]
*  Um that he had that he would put on his shoulder [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2563.0800000000004s)]
*  And then there was adderall around the office modafinil around the office. What's modafinil? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2567.6400000000003s)]
*  It's like a kind of like an adderall slightly different adderall. Um, I think it was used by like [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2573.2400000000002s)]
*  War pilots to stay awake or something like that [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2579.4s)]
*  Um, yeah, there was a there was a ton of that stuff [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2582.36s)]
*  It's very common in the tech world a lot of you know, most of I would say most of the generation sub 30 has a [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2585.2400000000002s)]
*  A bunch of friends that need adderall to operate, you know, there really yeah [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2592.04s)]
*  There was a time when it was handed out like candy by doctors [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2595.72s)]
*  I mean, I they're still attempting to put most kids on adderall. I think that show any sort of [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2599.8799999999997s)]
*  Inability to sit and focus 24 7. Um, so adderall is [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2605.62s)]
*  If you've sort of worked in companies in the tech world adderall just doesn't seem strange [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2610.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm not saying it's a good thing. It just it's math. I mean, it's chemically indistinguishable from math [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2614.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, but they gave it to kids. I mean they were given a test they went when I was younger [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2619.3999999999996s)]
*  They tried to put me on adderall and my parents thankfully were like no he [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2622.4399999999996s)]
*  He's just a little boy [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2626.6s)]
*  You know, he's just got energy because he's a boy in it, but it has all kinds of effects on the brain [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2628.6s)]
*  That you know some are positive [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2635.8799999999997s)]

*  I didn't i've maybe taken it once or twice. No, but in the office if you're working in a world where people are you know [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2649.0s)]
*  Everyone's on speed all the time [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2653.72s)]
*  People get jumpy paranoid have [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2655.56s)]
*  trouble maintaining focus paradoxically [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2657.8799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I I don't know if I know I mean sam was always odd since the moment I met him [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2661.08s)]
*  So maybe he had sort of had a long term use of it [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2665.08s)]
*  but [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2668.6s)]

*  So a lot of people when they present [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2738.04s)]
*  I mean you don't know this because you seem very honest on stage [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2740.12s)]
*  But a lot of people when they talk on stage don't tell the truth [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2742.6s)]
*  They certainly that's for sure. That's for sure they parrot this narrative that isn't real if you're actually in the industry [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2745.24s)]
*  So you go to these crypto conferences and people get up and say these ridiculous things, you know aren't true [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2750.44s)]
*  Uh sam got up there and told the truth [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2755.64s)]
*  He said, you know this company's good this company's product doesn't actually work [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2757.72s)]
*  Yada, yada, yada. He would just say that up on stage and I thought this is great [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2761.64s)]
*  Well, I agree with that. That is great. Yeah [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2766.2799999999997s)]
*  so [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2768.7599999999998s)]
*  You go meet him. He hires you [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2770.2799999999997s)]
*  he um [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2772.68s)]
*  He was reluctant to hire me because I was [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2773.64s)]
*  I think at the time more useful for him at circle. So I was still at circle [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2776.6s)]
*  We were doing some otc trading with his otc desk, but I eventually what's otc over the counter trading. Yeah [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2780.2s)]
*  It's just large blocks that don't hit the exchange and you just lock in a price you message someone and say hey [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2786.9199999999996s)]
*  I want to buy 100 bitcoin sell 100 bitcoin. They give you a price you agree or don't agree and then it moves to settlement [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2791.7999999999997s)]
*  That's what I was doing at circle and then I eventually got sam to hire me to run that at alameda [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2798.2799999999997s)]
*  I had also purchased a lot of his ftt token, which I think helped [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2803.96s)]
*  So he had launched a token for the exchange. He was going to build called ftx [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2807.64s)]
*  Sent it out to see if people wanted to invest in it and I was [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2811.8799999999997s)]
*  I purchased a large quantity of it. How much? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2815.8s)]
*  um, I [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2818.92s)]
*  God, it's like six million tokens. Maybe at the time [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2820.52s)]
*  At what valuation five cents? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2824.2000000000003s)]
*  Where'd you get the money? I made yeah, I well I just held crypto for a while and i'd made good money at circle as well. So [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2827.56s)]
*  So you you get hired by sam? Yeah to do what and where do you go? [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2835.32s)]
*  So i'm in hong kong he recently moved to hong kong I get hired to run the over the otc desk for him [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2840.44s)]
*  And that's what I did [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2847.96s)]
*  For how long? [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2850.44s)]
*  My job constantly changed there. Um, so I think I probably ran the otc desk and I had you know at a startup [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2852.04s)]
*  You pick up as many jobs as you can right? So sort of anything that's lacking you try to help out with so [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2858.6s)]
*  I ran the otc desk, but I was also helping [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2864.12s)]
*  You know get customers on ftx customer support for ftx when people had issues [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2866.12s)]
*  Um, you know, I was involved on the banking side [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2870.8399999999997s)]
*  Because I had the relationships, you know, a lot of these nerd type characters don't speak to people well and I did speak to people [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2873.96s)]
*  Well, so I took over a lot of the relationship based with a designated talker in the office. Yeah. Yeah, I was [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2880.8399999999997s)]
*  Sort of polar opposite of all these people [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2886.7599999999998s)]
*  um [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2888.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I took over a lot of those responsibilities. I worked it was about a year in that position [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2890.2s)]
*  And then I was totally burnt out. Um, i'd made a lot of money with ftt going up [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2894.76s)]
*  And so I that was the first time I went and tried to quit [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2901.32s)]
*  Or sent in a resignation letter and what happened? [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2905.0s)]
*  Um sam sent me back this sort of incredible letter about how he didn't want me to go [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2908.28s)]
*  I could do whatever I wanted basically, you know if i'm working too much drop some of the responsibilities [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2913.08s)]
*  um, I told him [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2918.44s)]
*  No, I was still leaving but then I went in to have a meeting with caroline actually and she started crying [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2920.36s)]
*  Um that I was leaving and it I don't know [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2925.0s)]
*  It was very sad, you know, she was working 24 7. I think she knew if I left she was gonna have to take over all my work [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2927.8s)]
*  I'd never seen her cry before [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2933.0s)]
*  And so she started crying. I said fine, you know what if you can stay and do this [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2935.0s)]
*  I can pull it together and stay and and do this so I didn't leave in 2019 [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2938.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, I tried to cut back my the work. You've had some time to replay this in your in your head. Oh god [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2942.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2948.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2951.0s)]
*  All of it [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2953.4s)]
*  um [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2955.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I tried to pare back the work I was doing but it's hard, you know, if you care about something it's hard to do less [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2956.44s)]
*  Um, you know, you know things are being dropped. You don't want them to be dropped. So you [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2963.4s)]
*  You know try to do them [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2968.1200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2970.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2972.1200000000003s)]
*  What was caroline ellison like? [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2973.2400000000002s)]
*  She's an interesting person, you know the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2975.5600000000004s)]
*  What are they all like so first of the effective altruism which we haven't touched on yet. Yes, it is this [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2978.12s)]
*  Very like silicon valley west coast elite parent concept that you this group of people have that they're smart enough to solve [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2984.52s)]
*  basically all the world's problems [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2992.2s)]
*  And the best thing you can do with your life is work as hard as possible to give all the money away [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2994.2799999999997s)]
*  Which on paper doesn't sound terrible, but there's a lot of things on paper that don't sound terrible that are in the real world like [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=2999.08s)]
*  socialism for instance, yes, um [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3005.24s)]
*  So that's the ea's and that was the center core of the company that was sam caroline gary nashad were effective altruists [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3008.2s)]
*  And that's what drove everything in the company. That was the center nucleus sounds like a religion [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3014.68s)]
*  Cult cult religion. Yeah, very much so so work as hard as you can [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3019.64s)]
*  To make money in order to give it away. Yes to [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3025.96s)]
*  These big brainy ideas that you know, uh ai or pandemic was I guess one of them [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3029.7999999999997s)]
*  But not to the housekeeper correct [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3036.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't even know if they value individual life that much to be honest with you [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3040.2799999999997s)]
*  It's it's a weird the effective altruist thing was weird. I hated it [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3044.12s)]
*  um [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3047.8799999999997s)]
*  Why aren't you a good person? [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3048.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3050.68s)]
*  Yeah, but there's no one's smart enough to solve all the world's problems and the moment you think you are you're the problem [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3051.56s)]
*  Not the solution. Yeah, that is deep and probably [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3056.9199999999996s)]
*  Nothing truer has been uttered [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3060.4399999999996s)]
*  Today that is absolutely right the moment you think you are you are the problem [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3062.28s)]
*  Um, so how did it manifest itself this effective altruism? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3066.84s)]
*  Well, you always knew it was the sort of guiding light of the company and you if you weren't an effective altruist [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3070.36s)]
*  You were never on the inside really right like there was [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3075.0s)]
*  They were sort of in charge of everything [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3077.88s)]
*  um [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3079.96s)]
*  And you know you sort of orbited around everyone else orbited around them [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3082.1200000000003s)]
*  Um, I guess is is how to describe it and would they talk about it? [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3086.0400000000004s)]
*  They would um a little bit if you were there at like 2 a.m. Or something, um, you know [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3089.96s)]
*  They would be having a conversation about it [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3094.28s)]
*  um [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3096.36s)]
*  Yeah, they love talking about like weird weird things like that like ai taking over the world or [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3097.88s)]
*  All those sort of things were they for ai taking over the world. They were well, so there's different factions of ea. I learned [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3103.88s)]
*  Some are concerned about it. Some are welcoming it and want it to happen sooner. Um [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3111.0s)]
*  Yeah, I do yeah [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3116.6800000000003s)]
*  But the core idea is were the elect were the elite were the people smart enough to fix the world's problems, correct? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3119.32s)]
*  Um, how are they gonna what problems are they gonna fix and how are they gonna fix them? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3127.32s)]
*  That's a great question. So ai came up and was a big one a lot. Um [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3131.88s)]
*  You know caroline had this nutty [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3136.28s)]
*  You never know it's true if they're saying these things or they're just saying them to hear themselves say them [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3139.1600000000003s)]
*  But she had this thing where she was convinced [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3144.92s)]
*  ai was going to take over the world and it was best to appease the [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3147.4s)]
*  ai lords now so in the future they won't kill you when they kill off all the rest of the humans [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3151.7200000000003s)]
*  um, so this is things she'd say like [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3157.88s)]
*  Who are the ai lords? [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3160.44s)]
*  I don't know. You're talking about someone that avoided this as much as possible, but she's occasionally sitting there. I mean really [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3161.88s)]
*  uh, yeah [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3168.36s)]
*  So this is a theology obviously, yeah, it's a cult I think cult is the only way to describe it really [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3171.2400000000002s)]
*  So you have to appease the ai lords? [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3177.0s)]
*  So they don't kill you [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3179.88s)]
*  While they're killing everybody else. This is one of the nutty things that they would come up with. Yeah [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3181.6400000000003s)]
*  Did did sbf agree with that? Do you think? [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3185.56s)]
*  I don't he was definitely yeah, he was a this extreme effect of altruist [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3189.32s)]
*  I don't know how he felt specifically about some of the weirder [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3193.4s)]
*  ai things [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3197.08s)]
*  Was he in a [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3199.0s)]
*  Personal relationship with caroline ellison. Yes, it was very it was kept very quiet for a long time [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3200.6s)]
*  But then you know, I knew her roommate at the time and he told me that they are in a relationship but [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3207.64s)]
*  It's like not a relationship like what you're thinking of I mean these are people that only cared about working [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3216.2799999999997s)]
*  Um, you know, no one's going on dates or having like long sunday mornings in bed. Yeah, none of that stuff [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3222.04s)]
*  It was where she had an infatuation with powerful men. She blogged about it a lot [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3228.68s)]
*  She always wanted to be around powerful men. And so I think she saw sam as a powerful man [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3234.12s)]
*  He was a powerful man. Yeah. Yeah, and so she wanted to be around that she liked actually one thing we [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3240.7599999999998s)]

*  I don't know if you've seen it. No, it's hamilton's great [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3251.08s)]

*  Which was like this erin burr scene, you know, he's singing [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3258.1200000000003s)]
*  I want to be in the room where it happens. Um, and so that she always [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3260.76s)]
*  Identified with that. She just wanted to be in the room where the important decisions were being made [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3264.34s)]
*  Oh, she's a power worshiper. Yeah, she was a power worshiper and very open about it. Really? Yeah [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3268.6800000000003s)]
*  Like i'm a power worshiper. She blogged about it all the time. She would write these sort of [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3274.84s)]
*  Blogs online they were public they were part of sbf's trial in case and so I mean the you know daily mail [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3279.8s)]
*  Among you know other [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3287.32s)]
*  The lower forms the media ecosystem have you know made a big deal out of the sex lives of everyone at ftx [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3289.08s)]
*  They're like living in canally. It's group sex or no. No, there's no way. I mean I didn't live with them [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3294.76s)]
*  But I knew these there's no way [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3299.96s)]
*  No way that they were having crazy group sex [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3302.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no, I I think the amish were probably having more fun than what was going on in that penthouse [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3304.84s)]
*  Well, you're making me feel better because I I don't want to be catty about it [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3309.8s)]
*  But you did see some of the players and you're thinking they should not be mating. No. Yeah [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3312.92s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think part of part of being this sort of west coast, you know enlightened thing is like polyamory is an okay idea [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3316.76s)]
*  Right, they try to wrap themselves up into that because that's the cool sort of elite intelligent thing to feel. Yes, but [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3324.76s)]
*  None of that was going on there a lot of them had monogamous relationships. They did all door [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3331.8s)]
*  There were about eight people I think in the in that penthouse [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3336.2000000000003s)]
*  but [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3340.52s)]
*  No, you know the media grabbed all sorts of fun headlines because that's what it does and runs with them [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3341.56s)]
*  I mean, that's what media is now right? It's just grabbing totally good headlines [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3346.28s)]
*  Um, you know a lot of the story and I I want to caveat this with a ton of people got hurt lost their lives [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3351.32s)]
*  Over a million people these are normal people who don't have a lot of money who are trusting it all in ftx [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3357.4s)]
*  So I want to caveat with everything i'm saying here, you know what ftx did and what happened to people is horrific [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3363.24s)]
*  And I have to live with that every day [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3369.32s)]
*  But a lot of the story has just completely been fabricated or or made up [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3370.92s)]
*  Did you ever go to the penthouse where they all lived? Yeah, so sam I was first in the bahamas [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3375.0s)]
*  So we didn't get to the second time. I tried to quit which was 21. I finally said look i'm finished i'm [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3380.04s)]
*  Working too hard again. I have some money. I'm gonna go enjoy my life. I'm 27. I think at the time [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3385.7200000000003s)]
*  um [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3390.84s)]
*  You know, I was in hong kong at the time and I was I was like i'm done [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3392.2000000000003s)]
*  And you know, I keep blaming the lawyers, but again, I go to the lawyers and I tell them i'm done [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3396.1200000000003s)]
*  Uh, and they said well, can you do us a favor? [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3400.76s)]
*  Um, you know, we know you still care about the company which is true [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3404.28s)]
*  But you know the bahamas had recently launched the dare act, which was a you know, sort of a revolutionary digital asset regulatory framework [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3407.56s)]
*  It was a better jurisdiction than a lot of the sort of other jurisdictions that do that [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3415.8s)]
*  It's not considered an a plus but it's not [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3419.48s)]
*  You know sort of a terrible jurisdiction, right? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3421.96s)]
*  You know, they have a real regulatory body. It's not as sophisticated as you know, a european country or the us or japan [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3425.6400000000003s)]
*  But it's not nothing. Um [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3431.7200000000003s)]
*  But the ceo needs to live in the country to be regulated there [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3433.96s)]
*  And at the time there was absolutely no way sam was moving the company to the bahamas. So, um, why? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3437.88s)]
*  We it's an island nation. It has strong sort of you know, they don't want you importing labor [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3444.6000000000004s)]
*  They want you hiring locally. There's not a lot of housing. It's it's an island [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3449.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, um small island small island. It's you know, there's not 24 7 food options [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3454.52s)]
*  There's not there's none of the infrastructure in place to run [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3459.48s)]
*  An actual large international organization out of out of the bahamas. It was impossible [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3463.2400000000002s)]
*  It was always going to be impossible, but that was not the plan [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3469.0800000000004s)]
*  The plan was I was going to go there run a small sort of shop. I hired, you know some local people [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3472.04s)]
*  Did some philanthropy there went through the regulatory process [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3478.3599999999997s)]
*  Um in the bahamas [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3481.8799999999997s)]
*  What's that like? [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3483.56s)]
*  It was fine. So we were working with the regulators to sort of educate them as well [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3484.92s)]
*  They were eager to really understand and learn about the technology and they were slowly adapting and building out the framework [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3488.04s)]
*  Um, but it was it felt real [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3493.96s)]
*  It wasn't just sort of you know [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3495.64s)]
*  This rubber stamp like they wanted to know what was going on how it was being operated what the different components of crypto were [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3497.4s)]
*  How it was changing? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3503.8s)]
*  um [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3505.4s)]
*  You know, it's seen I think to the world is like this fake [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3506.44s)]
*  Sort of place and regulatory environment, but didn't feel that way [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3510.44s)]
*  At all like you know, we were educating they were putting in place standards. They were trying to make them workable, but also monitor [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3513.7200000000003s)]
*  But i'm only there i'm there about two months and i'm basically i'm quasi retired [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3521.8s)]
*  I'm working like two hours a day, you know, we're doing the philanthropy stuff. I'm [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3525.88s)]
*  Getting it all settled there, but everyone else is in hong kong running the company during, you know business hours there. I'm free [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3530.52s)]
*  And i'm having fun. It was a great place to live. I was in a beautiful community [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3538.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it was great and then two months later sam visits [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3543.8s)]
*  And i'm sorry I should have asked what and what's your job title at this point? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3546.84s)]
*  I'm ceo of ftx digital markets, which is the bahamian subsidiary. Yes [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3550.12s)]
*  Titles didn't have a lot of meaning at [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3554.52s)]
*  ftx and alameda [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3556.9199999999996s)]
*  Um, they were kind of tossed around like candy to be honest [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3558.3599999999997s)]
*  It was oh you either you work hard or you don't your title doesn't matter. Um, you know as I write a laundry list of regrets [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3560.7599999999998s)]
*  Accepting a title that had no actual an important title that had no actual real meaning at the time is is one of them [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3567.56s)]
*  Uh for sure [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3574.2799999999997s)]
*  But sam visits uh and decides to move the entire company there [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3577.56s)]
*  Basically overnight he wants to import hundreds of people from all over the world [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3581.96s)]
*  Into the bahamas to build out a headquarters there. Um, I tell him it's not possible [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3586.84s)]
*  People aren't first off people aren't going to be happy right? These are people leaving cities vibrant cities. They most of them are young [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3593.48s)]
*  Some did have families but you know [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3599.32s)]
*  They want a social setting where they can go out to a nightclub or go out and meet people at whatever they do [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3601.0s)]
*  The bahamas is quiet. It's you're not going to get that [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3606.84s)]
*  Um, so you're gonna get they call it island fever [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3609.8s)]
*  Um, so I told sam it's impossible to move the company there. Nothing was ever impossible in sam's mind [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3612.92s)]
*  You know, it was just like let's get it done [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3617.8s)]
*  And so all of a sudden i'm back to working 24 7 only now i'm working in like the real world [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3619.88s)]
*  we're buying condos to house people in we're [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3625.2400000000002s)]
*  You know bringing in people to cook 24 7 so there was food available. We're modifying the structure of buildings to house more employees [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3629.0800000000004s)]
*  Um, yeah, I just it became mayhem. How much do you think ftx spent on real estate in the bahamas? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3637.2599999999998s)]
*  uh [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3643.58s)]
*  half a billion to [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3644.54s)]
*  Maybe 750 million million [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3646.14s)]
*  How could you spend 750 million dollars in the bahamas on real estate? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3649.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean there so there's two types of real estate [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3653.3399999999997s)]
*  Basically, there's very little middle class in the bahamas you have sort of this ultra wealthy section of the island [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3655.74s)]
*  Which is mostly people from foreign countries avoiding taxes and then you have sort of the impoverished section [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3660.62s)]
*  Which is um downtown, which is downtown, right? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3666.3s)]
*  We couldn't put employees in downtown nasa. Um, and so the available housing was extremely limited [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3670.86s)]
*  We also were worried about security [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3676.62s)]
*  Um and food and all these various other things so we ended up pivoting towards one of these sort of large very [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3678.7s)]
*  wealthy areas called albany [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3685.98s)]
*  They knew we were buyers of a lot so they would up the price very quickly [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3689.66s)]
*  Um, I actually begged at one point. I begged albany to stop selling sam [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3694.54s)]
*  real estate [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3698.7799999999997s)]
*  um, but they just obviously ignored me because they were making [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3700.14s)]
*  You know an insane amount of money, um, but a house in albany might be worth 40 or 50 million dollars [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3703.74s)]
*  40 or 50 million. Yeah. Yeah condos were I think 15 to 30 million on average [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3711.42s)]
*  Oh, so it's just totally fake money at this point [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3717.66s)]
*  Like that ftx and alameda are spending yeah, I mean if you're spending 15 million dollars on a condo in the bahamas [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3720.7s)]
*  I mean, that's just absurd. It's untethered from physical and more of a red flag. I mean I can try to justify it [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3726.7799999999997s)]
*  There's not great justifications. We made [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3732.62s)]
*  Just so much money at alameda when I was there. I mean we made unfathomable amounts of profit at alameda [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3735.1s)]
*  um [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3741.74s)]
*  that [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3742.8599999999997s)]
*  Relative to what we'd made at the time that I was aware of that didn't seem that crazy in hindsight now [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3744.22s)]
*  It's absolutely f-ing ridiculous. Excuse me [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3749.34s)]
*  But you know when you witness a company make two to three billion dollars in profit in a year [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3752.38s)]

*  But they used to say like we live in a world where you know teachers and carpenters don't make any money and I would go shut up [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3884.06s)]
*  but now i'm sort of like [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3890.62s)]
*  a little bit more sympathetic to the idea that [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3892.3s)]
*  I don't know your society should reward people who do useful things [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3895.02s)]

*  Uh, it's interesting though. So they [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3911.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3914.78s)]
*  Did you think it was weird that you're making that much money profit? [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3915.74s)]
*  I mean that's more than general motors makes in profit in crypto though. It's not uncommon [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3918.06s)]
*  You know the it'd become the norm to be in the crypto industry and just see people become phenomenally wealthy [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3921.9s)]
*  So is it normal in the real world? No, but in crypto, you know [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3928.14s)]
*  There are 16 year olds that made 100 million dollars off [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3932.3s)]
*  A lucky investment [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3935.9s)]
*  um [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3937.34s)]
*  There's so much money sloshing around in the crypto ecosystem all the time [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3938.46s)]
*  that [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3942.86s)]
*  No, it didn't it didn't so i'm such a primitive person that I don't trust anything digital [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3943.82s)]
*  So if I made, you know, 100 million dollars in crypto, whatever that is, I would immediately cash out and buy like [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3948.62s)]
*  Stuff. Yeah, what'd you do with the money that you made? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3955.66s)]
*  Basically everyone kept it [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3959.02s)]
*  So I had been given some advice that was very good advice and I didn't follow towards the end but [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3960.86s)]
*  You know if you keep the money fake online [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3965.98s)]
*  Then you don't sort of get wrapped up in this world of being wealthy [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3969.1800000000003s)]
*  um [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3972.7000000000003s)]
*  And so a lot of people just keep you know, there are people that are like living in a bean bag with [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3973.58s)]
*  50 million dollars in crypto [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3979.2400000000002s)]
*  Um, and it's sort of fake as long as you leave it in crypto. So I left most of it in crypto for a long time [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3981.02s)]
*  um, you know [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3986.54s)]
*  In 2021 it was wasn't till I moved to the bahamas really that I started to want to cash out and you know [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3988.54s)]
*  Get more involved in real world things [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3994.7s)]
*  So what did you buy in the real world? Yeah, um, I bought some restaurants during covet [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=3997.26s)]
*  I bought some restaurants back in the home my hometown area. Um, I knew some people in new england in new england the berkshires, um [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4002.94s)]
*  You know, they were going to close I had friends that worked at them or family that worked at them [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4011.02s)]
*  Um and wanted to support the local ecosystem there cool. I bought some well, yeah now everyone anyway [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4015.02s)]
*  Um, I bought some condos in the downtown as well because a lot of people were turning them into airbnbs [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4021.42s)]
*  So people didn't have a place to live and it's a very small downtown [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4026.06s)]
*  It's like two blocks of a scenic town in western mass. Um, but airbnbs really wrecked the united states [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4028.78s)]
*  Yeah, especially small town living area towns. Yeah, but I kept them all apartments. We fixed them up. A lot of them are old buildings [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4033.9s)]
*  Um, I had a buddy that was super into space x and so we bought some of the properties that were really close to [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4042.14s)]

*  They did middle east last time I think and uh, yeah [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4082.94s)]
*  You start in one area and for five days you drive to the next area and then have some event with everyone else [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4085.98s)]
*  Who's doing it? Um, so we started in canada and then drove down [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4090.86s)]
*  Uh, and the idea was to get down to florida but [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4095.1800000000003s)]
*  Michelle and I stopped halfway through but uh, what kind of vehicle did you drive? Uh, porsche. I actually buy here [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4098.46s)]

*  So the porsche tycan they don't say electric on it, you know [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4109.34s)]
*  Most ev cars or electric cars they say electric. I stupidly bought an electric car, which you couldn't use for gumball [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4112.78s)]

*  Yeah, where she would write these [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4204.7s)]
*  Scenes that were occurring and then she'd make a character list of different people and she'd assign a different person [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4206.86s)]
*  Like a role and your job was to sort of just flow around and figure out like what your objective was in the game [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4212.86s)]

*  Yes, fully clothed. Yeah, and I was probably the only one drinking or like two of us were having a drink [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4225.66s)]
*  Wow, she would write live-action role plays like what yeah nothing I ever would have done in my life [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4230.9400000000005s)]

*  I think the tech world is a little strange in that way. Um, but this having this ea component as well made it even weirder [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4270.38s)]
*  um [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4278.14s)]
*  Yeah, how did they treat you said when you were describing effective altruism that they didn't care about human life or people [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4279.74s)]
*  How did how did you reach that conclusion? [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4287.34s)]
*  Everything's ev or expected value and I want to blow my brains out every time I hear that now [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4289.5s)]
*  But every decision is ev. So what is the expected value of this situation? Um, and I think actually what does that mean? [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4293.900000000001s)]
*  I think kaplan touched on this a little bit during the sentencing with sam [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4300.62s)]
*  um, you know as if you could flip a coin and there's a 51 chance that [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4304.22s)]
*  I don't know. Everyone lives happily forever or a 49 chance that everyone dies [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4309.74s)]
*  Ev flip the coin [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4314.38s)]
*  Right [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4316.38s)]
*  Like whoa that kind of that's a very extreme. Sorry. I'm like taking a very extreme example [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4317.34s)]
*  But it's constantly looking at calculating the likelihood of benefit. Correct. Correct and making decisions based off that [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4321.1s)]
*  Um, and sam did it for everything. Um, you know, michael lewis touched on this a little in the book [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4327.740000000001s)]
*  um [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4332.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, sam did it for everything. It's not for running [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4334.14s)]
*  Yeah for running a company with proper structure. It's not terrible [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4337.1s)]
*  Like it's a good way to make some decisions for sure. You can't run everything like that though [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4340.700000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's important to calculate likelihood. Right I think [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4344.540000000001s)]
*  but [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4348.14s)]
*  I mean the acid test for decency is how do you treat the people you? [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4349.18s)]
*  You know who depended on you who you control your how do you treat your housekeeper? Yeah [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4353.58s)]
*  And how do they do by that measure? I they just wouldn't interact with the housekeeper would be the only man. Oh really? [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4357.66s)]
*  Yeah, they're [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4364.46s)]
*  Yeah, I didn't really interact with like many people like interaction wasn't [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4366.0599999999995s)]
*  their thing [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4371.0199999999995s)]
*  Did they it's interesting because they're all politically liberal obviously and the bahamas is a poor majority black country [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4372.3s)]
*  Were they doing a lot to help? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4378.139999999999s)]
*  The majority of poor people in the bahamas no, I did a lot of philanthropy in the bahamas when I was there so [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4380.54s)]
*  I think [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4386.62s)]
*  You know everything gets twisted with this terrible light now [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4387.740000000001s)]
*  But we were doing a lot [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4389.58s)]
*  You know we did a toy drive during the holidays to some of the islands that were hurt during dorian [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4390.38s)]
*  I fell in love with the bahamas. I fell in love with the culture there the people nice people for credible people incredible positive attitude. Yeah [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4395.1s)]
*  You know optimistic I I loved everything about sort of being in the bahamas. Yes [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4403.26s)]
*  So I did some philanthropy work there [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4408.06s)]
*  But the company really didn't do a lot there. So there was an ftx foundation that was doing more [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4410.46s)]
*  in [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4417.02s)]
*  like the us [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4418.54s)]
*  That actually joe sam's father ran joe bankman [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4420.38s)]
*  And then sam had this sort of big brain ea stuff that he was focusing on as well, which is your ai [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4423.5s)]
*  Ai climate was that a big climate wasn't because climate was getting enough attention [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4429.18s)]
*  So part of the ea thing was also very important things that weren't getting enough attention and climate got a lot of attention [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4435.179999999999s)]
*  So this was their explanation for why so ai what else like what were the other problems the pandemic sort of was running that [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4441.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4447.179999999999s)]
*  Those are the two that I remember [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4448.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, did you ever get the sense that they were helping anyone? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4451.42s)]
*  It's a good question. Um [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4455.42s)]
*  There was [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4458.7s)]
*  An issue so nishad and sam had an issue with so your idea is make as much money as possible to give it all away [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4459.98s)]
*  When do you start giving it all away? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4467.259999999999s)]
*  After all of your desires have been sated [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4471.5s)]
*  So nishad thought look we've made enough money. We've made a lot [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4474.54s)]
*  Let's start doing some of this actual ea stuff. I think in sam's mind. He hadn't even begun making money [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4478.94s)]
*  I [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4485.0199999999995s)]
*  Know it sounds crazy. It does say he's a billionaire, but he's not rich enough to actually give it away [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4486.139999999999s)]
*  Correct. I think he always [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4491.74s)]
*  You know, we never celebrated milestones at the company like when something was achieved [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4493.5s)]
*  Sam treated like it hadn't even begun. There was no sense of achievement ever [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4497.9s)]
*  You know [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4501.82s)]
*  I would host some celebrations when amazing things happened and sam would reluctantly get involved for a few minutes [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4502.0599999999995s)]
*  But in sam's dream world you never [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4507.099999999999s)]
*  There was no celebrating nothing was ever done enough [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4509.42s)]
*  Always more could be done [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4513.26s)]
*  So, you know kind of childhood do this guy have [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4516.3s)]
*  You know his mother wrote a letter where she talked a little about how he doesn't feel happiness [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4519.66s)]
*  She doesn't think he's ever felt or is capable of feeling happiness [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4523.26s)]
*  I don't I don't know michael lewis talked a little bit about his childhood [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4528.14s)]
*  I never talked to him about his childhood or anything like that. So do you ever deal with his mother a little bit? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4531.1s)]
*  um [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4535.74s)]
*  We're she's more similar to sam. I think like i'm not the type of person she enjoys being around [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4536.7s)]
*  I don't want to sit down and have a four-hour intellectual conversation where I try to prove that i'm smarter than you [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4541.34s)]
*  That's not you know, that's not my idea of a good time. So [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4546.46s)]
*  You know, we'd interact but I think she didn't love social [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4550.3s)]
*  Settings or like at least someone like me [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4553.58s)]
*  um, so not much [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4555.9800000000005s)]
*  She sounds awful [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4558.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I didn't know her that well, um [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4561.58s)]
*  You know, it's [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4565.74s)]
*  She's like an ethics professor and her son goes and does something like this [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4567.9s)]
*  I mean you gotta you gotta have a few question marks there. Yeah, I think you do [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4572.54s)]
*  um [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4577.82s)]
*  The lot of this was playing out against the backdrop of the 2020 election [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4578.78s)]
*  Yep. So what did what do they think of trump? What do they think of biden? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4582.86s)]
*  Um, his mother was very involved in getting biden elected. I believe we'd heard i'd heard stories about it. Um [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4587.179999999999s)]
*  The [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4594.78s)]
*  Yeah, I think her I think mind the gap did a lot and don't I might be wrong [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4597.26s)]
*  I think mine the gap did a lot in georgia that ultimately um flipped it blue for biden. Oh [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4601.26s)]
*  So [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4608.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. Um, i'm not 100 sure mrs. Bankman freed the ethics professors using [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4609.5s)]
*  Money, I mean because she's not independently rich, right? No, I don't not not what sam was right [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4616.22s)]
*  um [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4622.3s)]
*  Did any of sam's money go to that effort? Do you think yes? Yeah, I think sam wired 10 20 [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4623.42s)]
*  10 20 million maybe more [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4629.66s)]
*  Interesting to get biden elected, but he's not he's not facing any campaign finance charges. No, he didn't get hit with the campaign finance [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4632.9400000000005s)]
*  The story man [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4641.42s)]
*  You get into the details. What did they think of trump? [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4643.1s)]
*  They did not like trump. Um, they had this wild idea to try to pay him off to not run [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4645.9s)]
*  And I just said I don't want to be a part of that. Wait, what they I think it's quoting some news [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4652.94s)]
*  They had this idea to try to pay him five billion dollars to not run [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4658.139999999999s)]
*  um, who's they him and his brother gabe and [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4662.62s)]
*  There there was like more of these sort of ea political strategist people that would be uh election interference and bribery as far as I know [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4666.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't involved in it. Are they facing charges for that? No [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4674.7s)]
*  Oh [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4678.299999999999s)]
*  Because I think in a like a first world country bribing people [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4679.099999999999s)]
*  Um in the political system including not to run would be a felony like a major felony that would be [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4684.299999999999s)]
*  Subverting democracy, I think would be the term we'd use. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4689.66s)]
*  So but no charges there. Yeah interesting. Were you aware of that at the time? [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4693.9s)]
*  Uh, I it a briefly it had come up and I just said I don't want to be a part of this [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4698.54s)]
*  Please I also wanted him to win, you know, so i'm not yeah [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4703.099999999999s)]
*  I want him involved. Did they know that you disagreed politically? Yeah. Yeah, I mean that was part of [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4706.62s)]
*  You know, I don't want to make this out like I had no association with them at all [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4712.54s)]
*  Like gabe got me excited about the pandemic work, right? And so I got involved on the the pandemic work [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4716.22s)]
*  um [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4722.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's not illegal [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4723.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but um, so I was aware of some of the stuff that was going on [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4725.660000000001s)]
*  But not most of the behind the scenes stuff, right? I wasn't an ea. I was never in the ea world [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4728.780000000001s)]
*  I even sort of publicly mocked the ea. So um, you really didn't like ea [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4733.18s)]
*  I didn't there were a few of us that really didn't um, the only thing I liked about ea was it would bring workers in [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4738.46s)]
*  That worked 24 7 because they had a higher purpose like there was a higher purpose to why they were working [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4745.02s)]
*  And so they wouldn't get burned out as easily [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4749.820000000001s)]
*  Um, so that was the only thing I liked when ea started working. They worked 24 7 365 [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4752.3s)]
*  It's just the personality type seems so kind of classic early bolshevik to me. Yeah [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4757.82s)]
*  You know [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4764.7s)]
*  Yeah, I mean you're you're you're bringing about utopia in the world. So actual people don't matter [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4765.82s)]
*  You're involved in something much larger than yourself. So it gives [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4771.58s)]
*  Purpose and a framework to your life. Yeah, it inspired. I mean the early bolsheviks worked like animals [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4775.42s)]
*  I mean they did to their great credit. I mean they were really hard workers [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4780.46s)]
*  Yeah, and when it's written on paper, it doesn't sound as bad as it turns out. No, right [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4783.74s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right as you noted socialism doesn't say, you know, yeah, everyone everyone's equal. What's wrong with equality? [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4787.42s)]
*  Nothing. I mean even sam's whole thing like on paper it all sounded fine in the end millions of people lost all their money, right? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4793.1s)]
*  Better than the ukraine famine, but still it's it's a [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4801.26s)]
*  branch of the same tree so did um [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4804.7s)]
*  Sam ever decide that he'd made enough money to start giving it away. No, I don't think so [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4808.3s)]
*  I mean there was I think in his mind [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4812.38s)]
*  Well, sorry, let me caveat that in his mind some of the political work he was doing was giving it away to these bigger [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4814.3s)]
*  Initiatives, um, so I think that that was sort of a little bit [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4820.84s)]
*  But no not to the tune of what you'd expect from someone who that's their ideology [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4824.62s)]
*  So it sounds like the bankman freeds helped get [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4829.5s)]
*  Joe biden elected in 2020 for sure. I mean sam was one of the largest democratic donors [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4833.18s)]
*  hmm [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4838.860000000001s)]
*  I i'm this is just this whole conversation is just me trying to make you feel even worse about what happened here. I'm sorry [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4840.38s)]
*  Sorry, I feel no i'm just shocked by it. Actually, I shouldn't be [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4846.38s)]
*  But they were definitive players in a in a contested election that I don't think for the record once again [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4850.62s)]
*  Sorry youtube was legitimate. I don't think that this is another example of how it was illegitimate [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4857.26s)]
*  but whether you believe the results or not [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4862.14s)]
*  they were [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4865.02s)]
*  Huge players in getting joe biden elected and you're the one who's facing prison for campaign finance violations, correct? Yes [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4866.38s)]
*  I mean that's just absolutely nuts [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4876.78s)]
*  did um [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4880.86s)]
*  when they [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4882.54s)]
*  Mentioned paying off trump five billion dollars not to run. Do you do you know if anyone approached trump or the campaign about this? I don't know [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4883.9800000000005s)]
*  That's you never knew if they were just spitting out wacky ideas [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4891.66s)]
*  I mean, I think they also had this idea to buy like an island and try to make it like just their laws and their rules [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4894.22s)]
*  You know, it's just like they always have these crazy things [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4900.700000000001s)]
*  You never knew which how real something was or what was just what would their rules be on bankman frida island? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4903.1s)]
*  I do not want to know [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4908.46s)]
*  Yeah [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4909.900000000001s)]
*  Pretty weird, right? Yeah. Yeah, would he he was vegan? He was vegan. Yep. Um, why? [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4911.5s)]
*  uh animal cruelty [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4918.06s)]
*  He didn't like the idea of an animal suffering or yes. Yeah [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4920.22s)]
*  I mean, that's something that I think is definitely he stayed vegan now, right? He's slimming away to nothing in prison [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4924.38s)]
*  So, you know a lot of people said his whole yeah thing was fake [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4929.5s)]
*  At least the veganism I would say is real because now would be the time to drop the stick if it was well from your description [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4932.860000000001s)]
*  It sounds like the opposite of fake. It sounds like a sincere deeply held religious belief. It sounds like a cult [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4937.660000000001s)]
*  It sounds totally real. Yeah, did you think it was real at the time? I think it was real [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4943.660000000001s)]
*  There's I think a public perception in the world [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4947.1s)]
*  It was all just a show that he put on to try to raise more money, but I I don't believe that I think he genuinely [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4949.099999999999s)]
*  One of the mysteries for me is a total outsider watching this, you know from afar [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4955.58s)]
*  Is how investors could meet sam bankman frida who was like a child rocking back and forth? [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4961.5s)]
*  jumpy [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4968.7s)]
*  Stinky wearing cargo shorts and think I need to give that guy money. Yeah, I mean I can knock that [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4970.139999999999s)]
*  I was enthralled by him when I met him. I mean there's something about [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4976.62s)]
*  There's something about his work ethic the way he describes things [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4981.0199999999995s)]
*  He can sort of bring you into to the way he sees or feels about things [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4983.74s)]
*  He had a track record for a long time of being very right about things [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4988.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, there's this [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4993.58s)]
*  There's this kind of world where there's like idealized sort of central figures at companies [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=4996.3s)]
*  Yes, and they're [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5001.0199999999995s)]
*  Either wildly successful or not right not his sam bankman frida elizabeth holmes is is elon musk or you know sam altman or steve jobs [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5002.62s)]
*  Right. So there's this sort of central [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5011.18s)]
*  tech [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5013.26s)]
*  Single person that you follow and have a lot of faith in concept that pays off handsomely or it doesn't and it seems to really [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5014.54s)]
*  Only go one way or the other so [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5022.54s)]
*  Um, I think everyone's trying to find that next elon musk and sam had a ish vibe that it could be him [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5025.0199999999995s)]
*  That's such a smart analysis [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5031.74s)]
*  I don't not my world, but I just feel that you're absolutely right that a lot of these places are effectively cults of personality. Yeah [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5033.339999999999s)]
*  and [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5040.139999999999s)]
*  It does seem like a very collaborative business tech actually. Yeah, yeah, that's right [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5041.179999999999s)]
*  but [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5045.66s)]
*  In case after case whether zuckerberg or or whomever the old people you listed one person gets all the credit. It does feel that way [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5046.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, and it either goes well or you know, it either goes too well or too too poorly [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5053.099999999999s)]
*  So when things started to fall apart [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5058.78s)]
*  Um [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5061.66s)]
*  What was your reaction? What was carolyn ellison's reaction? What was sam bankman frida's reaction? Yeah [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5062.78s)]
*  So I had I had resigned from the company in june [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5067.74s)]
*  What year of 22 so before it collapsed but a couple other people had just resigned [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5072.22s)]
*  And I didn't we didn't want the publicity of another why did you resign I had tried to leave two years ago, I mean [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5077.580000000001s)]
*  I'd moved to the bahamas to get away from everyone and that everyone showed up [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5084.3s)]
*  So I left the bahamas for dc to get away from everyone again [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5087.9800000000005s)]
*  um [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5092.3s)]
*  Wow, so and then the whole purpose of me being ceo is because the ceo wasn't going to actually live there [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5093.1s)]
*  But now sam was living there so he could be the you know, he was the actual yes person in charge [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5098.46s)]
*  He could be the ceo on paper if he was going to live there. So [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5103.740000000001s)]
*  Um [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5106.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I was done again [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5107.82s)]
*  So you resign [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5110.78s)]
*  Did you when you resigned did you have any inkling that the company was in trouble? No [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5112.379999999999s)]
*  No, it seemed I mean it's look at look. It sounds crazy now. It seemed impossible [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5116.78s)]
*  I mean sam was quoted in forbes is worth 40 billion dollars [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5120.7s)]
*  Um, I had watched alameda make billions and billions of dollars [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5124.379999999999s)]
*  FTX is a very good business that was making about a billion a year in revenue. Um sam had launched [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5127.98s)]
*  multiple crypto projects that [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5133.98s)]
*  Had taken off. Um [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5136.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, I got my first ever death threat when we wouldn't sell someone more [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5138.62s)]
*  pre-launch token that sam had just [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5144.04s)]
*  Launched right he was selling sort of early release of a token called maps crazy token idea [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5146.78s)]
*  Um, and what was the idea? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5152.219999999999s)]
*  It was maps like your map google map service or whatever offline on the blockchain [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5154.7s)]
*  Okay, yeah, there's no more to say about that everything you're thinking about that is 100% well, I don't even understand it [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5160.96s)]
*  What is that? It's because it doesn't make any sense [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5168.56s)]
*  sam launches that is like selling it off to people and [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5171.92s)]
*  We told someone they couldn't buy anymore and some guy threatened to like kill my whole family if we wouldn't sell him [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5175.76s)]
*  I mean, this is how people were clamoring to be involved in anything spf touched. So [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5180.88s)]
*  um [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5186.4s)]
*  Yeah, the idea that there would be significant financial troubles like this just seemed impossible [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5187.44s)]
*  I mean in high sight now, I understand, you know, because it was just so hot. It was so hot [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5192.879999999999s)]
*  There was so I mean everything, you know [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5197.679999999999s)]
*  I sam could have pulled a booger out and sold it to someone for 100 million dollars. I mean it's [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5199.5199999999995s)]
*  How interesting human psychology never changes does it no it's repeated over and over and over it really is everything's the tulip craze [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5205.36s)]
*  Everything and it's just but it's funny because silicon valley had this [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5212.719999999999s)]
*  You know massive valuation bubble in 2000 [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5215.92s)]
*  Webvan and e toys and you know, all these kind of ludicrous companies went under and people really suffered as a result [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5220.0s)]
*  And then it happens again. Yeah [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5226.639999999999s)]
*  15 years later [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5228.719999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I mean cryptos [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5230.16s)]
*  Crypto's done a lot of these up and down so it's not it's not quite tulip and that it was up and then down of course [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5231.759999999999s)]
*  And I think sam as a figurehead type person is going to happen again and again and again [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5236.639999999999s)]
*  And it's interesting so where were you when you realized the company was in actual trouble? [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5240.72s)]
*  I was at a buccaneers game [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5247.360000000001s)]
*  watching tom brady play [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5250.56s)]
*  in [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5252.400000000001s)]
*  in florida [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5253.68s)]
*  And what how did you find out? [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5255.280000000001s)]
*  So the balance sheet had leaked the sort of infinite balance sheet about a week before I want to say had leaked and it was [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5256.88s)]
*  Alameda's balance sheet [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5262.38s)]
*  And what it showed was that alameda had basically been borrowing from a ton of lenders with [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5264.5599999999995s)]
*  Questionable assets so they had a bunch of assets on their books that were tokens that sam himself had created [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5270.46s)]
*  And then went out to lenders and they lent to them [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5276.48s)]
*  now when that [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5279.679999999999s)]
*  Broke my first thought was our lenders are screwed. Well, that's it's so funny. You read my mind [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5281.28s)]
*  That's the first thing that's what I thought too. You know [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5286.32s)]
*  I don't know how much fault like everything was very transparent with the lenders [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5289.360000000001s)]
*  There was no desire to no one was hiding anything from the lenders. They wanted to lend [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5293.280000000001s)]
*  They had to keep showing new originations so they could show that they were growing [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5298.88s)]
*  You know everyone talks in crypto like we're building this huge ecosystem [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5302.320000000001s)]
*  But everyone wants their share of the pie to be the largest right? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5305.120000000001s)]
*  You know, it's um [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5308.72s)]
*  Binance used to love to say like let's all pick each other up and then binance would crush little companies so it can get bigger [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5309.92s)]
*  It's business. It's i'm not knocking it. It's but [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5315.360000000001s)]
*  Um the lenders wanted to be the what kind of lenders when you say lenders genesis celsius. They're all bankrupt now [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5317.839999999999s)]
*  shockingly [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5324.94s)]
*  Genesis celsius block fi [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5327.28s)]
*  Blockchain.com i'm missing a couple they're all crypto lenders [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5331.66s)]
*  Um, and they're all yeah, they're all holding people's assets for them and then lending them out and providing a return [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5335.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5341.92s)]
*  You know this sort of collapse of over lending [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5343.759999999999s)]
*  Is also repeated itself over and over again, right? [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5346.88s)]
*  So the crypto industry was just a large microcosm of that [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5350.4s)]
*  But this balance sheet leaks that shows basically genesis but a couple other lenders had been lending [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5353.36s)]
*  I mean i'm talking eight ten fifteen billion dollars to alameda [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5358.24s)]
*  Against what are you know, inarguably questionable things to be lending against [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5362.64s)]
*  So my first thought paper maps on the blog j. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I made a joke [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5368.48s)]
*  It was like a ham sandwich, you know alameda was like look we got a ham sandwich. Can we borrow 15 billion? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5372.48s)]
*  But they were doing it with other firms through so three arrows is another trading firm [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5377.759999999999s)]
*  I mean they weren't even preparing financials. It turns out they were just borrowing billions from these lenders [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5381.599999999999s)]
*  anyway, so this I could go on forever with this but the [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5386.24s)]
*  Balance sheet leaks and my immediate reaction is not that ftx is in any trouble [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5389.839999999999s)]
*  My immediate reaction is our lenders. Yeah are in a lot of trouble for this [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5393.679999999999s)]
*  Um, but then this sort of rumor starts to come out that um [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5398.4800000000005s)]
*  Ftx doesn't have customer funds like it's the the balance sheet [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5403.52s)]
*  To some people somehow revealed that ftx didn't have the customer funds and I think a lot of that was driven by [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5408.56s)]
*  Binance the sort of competitor which was sam's argument. Um [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5413.84s)]
*  But so i'm at the buccaneers game. I send this message that's been quoted now with like in sam's trial [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5418.240000000001s)]
*  I send to caroline. Hey, can ftx meet all the withdrawals? [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5424.16s)]
*  She doesn't tell me yes or no. She testifies that she goes back and asks sam whether to like be honest with me or not [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5427.84s)]
*  Um, so it's over, you know, it is very blurry in my mind. How sorry just for a baseline [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5434.400000000001s)]
*  How old is she at this point? [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5439.12s)]
*  30 29 30 everyone's no one's older than that except the lawyers who were involved who are all adults and had yeah [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5441.12s)]
*  No one for them is just pure profit like they're off doing their [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5448.8s)]
*  Lawyer crime somewhere else, but they just pocketed the money and they were never indicted or hassled by the fbi or anything [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5453.12s)]
*  I I don't know the experience they've all had. Um, but they're not in trouble [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5458.24s)]
*  Sorry, just I can't keep hammering that enough [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5463.92s)]
*  It's it's an interesting aspect of it [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5466.8s)]
*  There's a lot of documentaries coming out about ftx and that seems to be a central point that a lot of them are focusing in [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5468.4s)]
*  on too that the lawyers [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5474.0s)]
*  Skated yeah almost impossibly. So given sort of public information [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5476.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, I thought it was weird [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5480.66s)]
*  I mean, i'm gonna I don't know what they're gonna do to me now, but yeah going to prison like you know, whatever [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5482.66s)]
*  You know, I had almost thought the [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5488.18s)]
*  The government and other people laid out the exact my defense, right? [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5490.34s)]
*  So like dan friedberg the general counsel for alameda put out his own statement saying that he was in charge of all regulatory affairs at alameda [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5494.0199999999995s)]
*  Like that was in his words, um that he stated that [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5502.0199999999995s)]
*  Uh, you know the where is where is friedberg in prison now? No, he's not he's not [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5505.3s)]
*  No, he's not he's not in charge [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5509.54s)]
*  um [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5512.18s)]
*  You know the government noted I was worth hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. So [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5513.7s)]
*  Like i'm just choosing to make this a crime like I thought my defense had been laid out by other people [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5518.66s)]
*  In like an odd way [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5523.78s)]
*  That no one seemed to care [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5525.78s)]
*  About but yeah, I get it [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5528.42s)]
*  So you're at the bucks game you text caroline. Can we [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5531.78s)]
*  Can we do we have the money yeah, are these rumors true basically, um [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5536.26s)]
*  I don't remember, you know, it starts to become apparent. They are I remember I think a day later [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5541.06s)]
*  His name is zane tackett [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5547.54s)]
*  He worked for ftx and he sends me like dude. This is a complete effing joke [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5549.22s)]
*  There's zero money in the cold wallet, which is a crypto term for basically where all of custodians money should be [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5553.46s)]
*  Um, you know and I wrote him back something like haha. That's not possible. Like it's got to be somewhere [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5559.62s)]
*  And he was like no dude, there's no, you know, all the customers money is is not where it's supposed to be [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5564.820000000001s)]
*  And so then you know, it becomes more real in that moment. I fully you know, maybe i'm just in denial [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5570.02s)]
*  I wasn't appreciating [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5575.9400000000005s)]
*  The money could be gone like where to go right like sam's not off buying, you know, he bought houses for the company [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5577.620000000001s)]
*  Don't get me wrong, but he's not out there blowing hundreds of millions of dollars on his own personal life [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5582.900000000001s)]
*  Right. Everything is somewhere in the system. That is sam's system. Where is it? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5588.34s)]
*  And then it becomes clear [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5593.7s)]
*  Um, I don't remember when this is all public [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5595.7s)]
*  So if I I don't want to screw up and say this day and it was actually the day before [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5597.94s)]
*  but um [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5601.62s)]
*  Sam drops the ventures book into a chat [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5602.74s)]
*  Which is all of the money that he has spent in ftx ventures [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5606.0199999999995s)]
*  Ftx ventures was a vcr that he launched about a year before and he publicly said he was putting a billion dollars into it [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5610.339999999999s)]
*  um [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5616.82s)]
*  And we all you know, he's he's worth 40 billion with forbes. I knew he his money in my mind was somewhere so it's fine [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5617.7s)]
*  um [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5624.34s)]
*  But then he drops his ventures book into this chat that i'm in which is now an infamous infamous chat called small group chat [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5625.22s)]
*  And he says hey we've you know [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5631.0599999999995s)]
*  Can anyone sell this ventures book or start selling off some of it to meet the liquidity needs? [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5632.58s)]
*  And I opened the ventures book and I scrolled and scrolled and scrolled and got to the bottom and there was like [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5636.98s)]
*  six to eight billion dollars of [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5641.86s)]
*  ftx ventures investments and [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5644.26s)]
*  It clicked to me. That's where the customer's money was [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5647.22s)]
*  He had sort of taken what I think happened and I think a lot of people don't think this is the truth, but in my mind [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5650.820000000001s)]
*  Sam had taken all the money from alameda that he borrowed from genesis and he when [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5657.7s)]
*  When crypto tanked or started going down and they weren't making as much trading he poured it into a ventures book [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5662.5s)]
*  And then eventually the lenders recalled all those loans and sam didn't have the loans because he poured it all into the ventures book [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5668.26s)]
*  Which is illiquid you can't turn it into cash right away. And so he went and took customers funds any of those investments hit [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5674.34s)]
*  Yeah, a bunch of them did great actually really good. It was a phenomenal [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5680.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's why customers are being paid back so much anthropic alone. I think he made [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5684.02s)]
*  um like 500 done [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5688.34s)]
*  No, they were great. A lot of them were great investors [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5691.06s)]
*  That's interesting. I didn't know any of this. So, um [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5694.02s)]
*  Not a defensive sam bank. No, it's not a i want to be clear. It's not a defense. You can't do that. But um, [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5697.54s)]
*  Do you think [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5703.06s)]
*  you know [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5704.34s)]
*  Net net as I say in your business that was that was like a [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5705.54s)]
*  smart move [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5708.9800000000005s)]
*  If it wasn't with with the lenders money. Yes. Here's what I think should happen [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5711.22s)]
*  He took all that lenders money and put it into ventures and then when he couldn't repay the lenders [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5714.9s)]
*  He should have gotten on the phone and called them. Yeah, for sure. What do you want to do here? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5720.1s)]
*  Like I got this ventures book. It's not a bad book [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5724.58s)]
*  Do you I mean I could file bankruptcy if you want I can give you guys the ventures [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5727.54s)]
*  Like how do you want to solve that's not yeah [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5731.46s)]
*  Because when you know once you take that much from an institution famously, you know, you've got some power [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5733.78s)]
*  Yeah, correct. You're almost too he became too big to fail and then didn't use it [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5739.86s)]
*  Interesting why? [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5745.2s)]
*  I don't know. I think about that a lot [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5747.06s)]
*  I you know, and that's if what i'm telling you turns out to be the correct story [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5749.22s)]
*  I mean I was so uninvolved [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5752.58s)]
*  You know the world really because i've pled guilty to something associated with this the world really wants me to have been like heavily [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5754.02s)]
*  Involved in this or because sam brought me into a group chat [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5759.22s)]
*  But I hadn't been aware of what the company was doing since I've been involved you would have been indicted for it [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5761.9400000000005s)]
*  I assume yeah, I know government would for sure. Yeah, right and so I again we don't need to guess about that [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5766.1s)]
*  I mean you went through the process you're headed to prison and you haven't been charged with or pled to any crime [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5773.14s)]
*  Related to the fraud at ftx. That's correct. Yes. I know it's correct. They had me involved [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5779.780000000001s)]
*  They threatened bank fraud which is asinine [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5785.14s)]
*  But they I was cc'd on an email between general counsel and the bank and sam that [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5788.68s)]
*  Was a bank application? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5795.64s)]
*  That they argued did not completely articulate what that bank account was supposed to be doing [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5798.04s)]
*  So they they dangled bank fraud as a potential but there's no email from you saying hey [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5803.72s)]
*  Let's take customer money and spend it on things [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5808.76s)]
*  No, no, and I think the bank fraud accusation is one of the most crazy actually but [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5811.8s)]
*  That's you know, I didn't plead guilty to that. Yeah [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5816.28s)]
*  Interesting so at this point when you're [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5820.42s)]
*  Texting back and forth with people who are still at the company and you hear that there are no, you know [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5825.320000000001s)]
*  We have no app, you know, there's no money [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5830.84s)]
*  Do you do you think i'm in trouble? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5833.4800000000005s)]
*  No, I really didn't think I mean I knew I was about to have a hellish [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5836.84s)]
*  You know year or two ahead. Yeah, but no [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5841.16s)]
*  I didn't think I was going to be in trouble [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5844.5199999999995s)]
*  You know [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5847.16s)]
*  I had most of my money on the platform. Like if I knew this was a fraud [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5848.44s)]
*  I wouldn't have my money on the platform. I at all times [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5851.32s)]
*  Thought I got the right people involved. I got lawyers involved where I thought it was necessary [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5854.919999999999s)]
*  I you know, I thought the decisions that I had made the entire time I was there [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5859.16s)]
*  Were the reasonable correct decisions? [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5864.759999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I knew there was going to be a lot of action interaction with the government [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5867.48s)]
*  But no, I did not expect to have any legal trouble so when did you find out you're in trouble? [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5871.72s)]
*  um [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5876.52s)]
*  Let's see. So we're proffering which for everyone doesn't know you [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5877.8s)]
*  The lawyer you tell the lawyer's stuff and then they go to the government and talk about it [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5881.56s)]
*  And then the government comes back with questions and then you answer their questions [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5885.72s)]
*  And so there's this interaction between your lawyers and the prosecutors [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5888.92s)]
*  About everything you have and know and want to share [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5893.32s)]
*  And so I was doing a couple of those and I thought everything was going well, I think this was about january maybe february [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5896.68s)]
*  Um, so this is for me three. Yeah, so this is four months ish after [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5903.16s)]
*  the collapse [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5907.0s)]
*  You know [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5909.16s)]
*  I had sent off my cell phone for like two hundred thousand dollars to be completely downloaded imaged and sent to the government for everything [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5909.56s)]
*  They needed why did it cost 200 grand? I don't know. It's what they charge at these [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5917.16s)]
*  I don't I don't know and the lawyers recommend a firm you use them [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5921.4s)]
*  Um, but the fbi showed up at my house one day. It was early morning [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5925.160000000001s)]
*  You know, I answered the door in my bathrobe [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5931.8s)]
*  There's police everywhere. There's probably 30 armed agents that had the entire house surrounded with assault rifles pointed at me. There was [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5933.96s)]
*  Some guy with a battering ram obviously a guy with a megaphone yelling at me [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5941.080000000001s)]
*  um, and [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5945.160000000001s)]
*  without any warning [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5947.240000000001s)]
*  No, in fact the lawyers were you know [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5949.400000000001s)]
*  I asked the lawyers is someone the police are gonna show up at the house and they said almost certainly not [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5951.32s)]
*  You know, we're cooperating with them. We're giving them everything they want [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5955.4s)]
*  You're answering all their questions [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5959.5599999999995s)]
*  We don't expect that to happen [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5963.0s)]
*  But they they did they were there they seized my cell phone [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5965.5599999999995s)]
*  And michelle's cell phone [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5969.4s)]
*  They came with a battering ram and automatic rifles to take your cell phones [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5971.16s)]
*  Yeah, a lot of cruiser [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5974.599999999999s)]
*  I mean it was really nuts and then they held us in the car as all the school buses went by which was [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5975.639999999999s)]
*  Infuriating so the fbi shows up at your house rather than just calling your lawyer and saying hey [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5981.719999999999s)]
*  We know you've imaged your cell phones already at the expense of two hundred thousand dollars [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5988.12s)]
*  With like physical possession of your cell phones. They show up with multiple cruisers automatic weapons a battering ram [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5993.16s)]
*  You're at home with your child. I think and your pets. This is pre-child at this point pre-child [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=5999.88s)]
*  Yeah, just pregnant pregnant girlfriend [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6004.92s)]
*  great perfect and um [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6007.5599999999995s)]
*  They show up and then throw you in a cruiser. Yeah, they held us in the cruiser for a while. They were very upset [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6009.72s)]
*  We'd brought our cell phones out with us [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6015.88s)]
*  Um, I think they had this grand image of like trashing my house. I think is what a lot of these guys wanted to do [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6017.96s)]
*  Um, they certainly wanted to enter the house. I could hear them discussing they were upset. They couldn't enter the house [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6023.96s)]
*  These fbi employees? Yeah, we had had our phones with us when we went outside so they had no justification to enter [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6028.04s)]
*  Uh the house anymore. So they held us in the cruiser for a while [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6035.080000000001s)]
*  I could hear some back and forth about being upset. They couldn't go in the house [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6038.12s)]
*  Uh, you know all the school buses are coming by which was unfortunate and then once the school buses were done [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6041.32s)]
*  They let us go back inside the house [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6045.4s)]
*  You know, and it's scary. I mean being without your cell phone all of a sudden is hard [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6048.44s)]
*  You know, there's people trying to get in touch with you and get in touch with the lawyers and things like that. So [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6051.4s)]
*  Um, you know, you got to run down to the store buy a new cell phone [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6055.64s)]
*  But it was the government sending a message, you know, we don't we don't believe you [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6058.84s)]
*  You know, we have a different narrative and you know, you're facing the government right now. So [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6063.16s)]
*  Get in line [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6067.4800000000005s)]
*  But again, the only purpose of sending guys with automatic rifles in a battery ram is to intimidate you [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6069.320000000001s)]
*  Correct. You're an american citizen [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6076.52s)]
*  and [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6079.08s)]
*  That embarrass you. I mean the neighbors see it's loud. It's yeah [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6079.88s)]
*  But treat you like garbage. You've not been convicted of anything. Not only that but I thought into that moment [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6084.84s)]
*  We were being very cooperative. I mean I had you know, there's this sort of [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6089.72s)]
*  narrative out there that I refused to [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6093.240000000001s)]
*  Cooperate with the doj. I wasn't giving them what they wanted. That's not true. I immediately cooperated [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6095.719999999999s)]
*  you know, I replied to the bahamian government when they emailed me and I [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6100.92s)]
*  Was offering the doj what I had? [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6104.92s)]
*  I just I don't think what I had jives with their story of how things were [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6108.36s)]
*  And the narrative that they were able to create and so they weren't [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6112.44s)]
*  You know, they allude to and they're very careful with it [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6115.719999999999s)]
*  So, you know, I don't want to accuse them of being well not accused but like they're not outward with this [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6118.5199999999995s)]
*  But they through the proffering you can kind of tell what you're able to say that would help you save yourself a little bit more [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6122.68s)]
*  They don't tell you directly but it's you know [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6130.12s)]
*  Describe this campaign finance in a different way or you know, how how does this reconcile, you know [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6132.6s)]
*  They sort of tell you their narrative [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6137.64s)]
*  Um through the questioning and it's your decision if you play ball or not and I just decided I wasn't going to lie to [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6139.64s)]
*  The government to save myself [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6146.12s)]
*  Um, like I feel some other people have in this situation so [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6148.5199999999995s)]
*  who [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6153.64s)]
*  Um, I don't think well look I know nashad did not think he was committing campaign finance fraud [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6154.76s)]
*  Um, I know that for a fact [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6160.44s)]
*  You know the idea that people worth hundreds of millions two billions of dollars can be straw donors just doesn't make it doesn't even cross your mind [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6163.8s)]
*  um [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6171.24s)]
*  You know I had had [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6172.5199999999995s)]
*  When michelle ran for congress I had foreign people that would text me and say hey, you know [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6174.04s)]
*  I'll send you 50 bucks. You can put in your campaign and I reply no, that's illegal [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6177.8s)]
*  Or we can't take foreign money. I appreciate the offer [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6181.96s)]
*  Or even, you know us people would be like hey, you know, i'll just venmo it, you know, you can put it in [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6185.08s)]
*  No, you can't do that. That's so you're speaking of the mother of your child who ran for congress in new york. Yeah [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6189.0s)]
*  Didn't win [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6196.12s)]
*  and is now in trouble for [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6197.64s)]
*  Or [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6199.96s)]
*  Taking money from you or something unclear exactly for us having commingled finances right and her work for ftx not being real [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6201.16s)]
*  um [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6209.24s)]
*  Yeah [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6210.68s)]
*  Yeah [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6211.96s)]
*  So where was I before that? Sorry. Sorry. I just have to point out that they're [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6213.24s)]
*  Again, I I wouldn't be saying any of this if you had even been accused of participating in the core fraud here [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6218.52s)]
*  But you haven't been even accused of that. So by the government so um [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6224.52s)]
*  But [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6229.4800000000005s)]
*  But you did give to republican candidates. Yes, and I was associated with ftx [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6230.360000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah. Yeah [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6236.120000000001s)]
*  Well, a lot of people were who haven't been indicted. I mean right in our system [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6237.96s)]
*  I don't know if you know this but the people who commit the crimes get indicted [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6241.320000000001s)]
*  People haven't committed the crimes don't get indicted. That's that's the promise of the system. I'm not sure I [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6244.040000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure I believe that well, I don't either that's why this is a fast-ending interview, but I I used to believe that [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6248.4400000000005s)]
*  Did you believe that yeah, I held up right until very recently believing that you know, I even tried [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6254.92s)]
*  I'm I'm not I'm not a victim. I will never be a victim. I don't consider myself a victim [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6261.88s)]
*  I chose to listen to the lawyers. I I made the decisions [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6266.84s)]
*  That I got and so I don't want I don't want this narrative to be that I feel like i'm a victim of something [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6270.5199999999995s)]
*  And I I go out of my way to make sure I don't have that feeling [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6274.84s)]
*  Um, so I constantly try to spin it in my head to make it more [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6278.36s)]
*  The narrative events that I know isn't true, but i'm constantly trying to get there to make this all make sense [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6284.28s)]
*  So, you know, I had a lot of faith [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6288.84s)]
*  I don't dislike the legal system or have that strong of issues with it until I sort of saw what I saw [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6290.68s)]
*  Um and saw how it plays out. I mean that the well i'm I I think you're taking the right tack [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6297.16s)]
*  Emotionally, I think it's very destructive to think of yourself as a victim [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6303.62s)]
*  I think the democratic party destroys millions of lives by encouraging americans in certain groups to think of themselves as victims [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6307.64s)]
*  I agree with you 100 percent but as a factual matter you are a victim [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6313.4s)]
*  because [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6317.5599999999995s)]
*  The crimes to which you play guilty are not crimes [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6318.5199999999995s)]
*  From my read of it. I don't understand how those are crimes. It doesn't make any sense at all [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6322.04s)]
*  If you're borrowing against your own assets [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6326.92s)]
*  And then you take that which every rich person in the world who's invested in low basis equities for example does [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6330.92s)]
*  Then every person, um [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6338.5199999999995s)]
*  Um [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6340.52s)]
*  That money that you get from that loan or any loan is yours [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6343.320000000001s)]
*  It's yours. And if you donate some of that to political candidates, you're not a straw [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6348.68s)]
*  Donor for the person who loans you the money. I mean, that's like that's crazy [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6353.0s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I I think so you are a victim in that sense [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6357.400000000001s)]
*  That's like not a crime and to construe that as a crime is like [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6359.64s)]
*  It's self a miscarriage of justice in my opinion [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6363.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think it says a lot of why there was an inducement right there's no need to make an inducement to get [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6366.12s)]
*  Someone to to plea if you have a good case or or if that's very guilty, right? You only bring up an inducement [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6370.68s)]
*  Because you know [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6377.639999999999s)]
*  Did you know this person's not? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6378.92s)]
*  Believing or getting to the same place you want them to get to right? So threaten your family [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6381.24s)]
*  It's it's more common than you'd think. Oh, I know the varsity blues case [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6385.5599999999995s)]
*  You know in a lot of the reality is people don't have sympathy for wealthy people, right? Which is fair [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6389.08s)]
*  I'm not arguing there's plenty of people that have sympathy for and so when there's a misjustice to someone with money [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6393.24s)]
*  A lot of the world's just like well, I am a wealthy person [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6398.68s)]
*  I guess relatively speaking and I intensely dislike rich people even though, you know, i've been one my whole life really [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6401.0s)]
*  But yeah, I dislike them a lot because I think they've been terrible leaders of our country [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6407.72s)]
*  Um, and I also just I don't I just don't like them personally. Uh, so I get it [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6413.0s)]
*  I absolutely understand that bias that bigotry but but the system itself [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6416.92s)]
*  Should should guard itself from bias and bigotry [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6421.96s)]
*  Just because you don't like okay, you don't like black people. Does that mean every accused black person should go to prison? [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6425.719999999999s)]
*  No, of course not. That's horrible. It's immoral. Yeah, right. And so it's such it's true for any group you assess [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6430.36s)]
*  The crime on its own terms. Is this actually a crime? Did the person actually commit the crime? [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6437.16s)]
*  And what's the appropriate punishment for committing that crime? Like those are the only questions that matter [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6442.28s)]
*  It doesn't matter what group you're from, right? Yeah, that's how you'd expect the legal system to work. I think but it's it's clear as day [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6447.32s)]
*  That's not how it it works if they told you that because you're white and straight that you can't get a fair trial [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6453.32s)]
*  Like don't we have a civil rights division at the justice department? I mean, that's the problem [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6459.8s)]
*  So it would be like well, you know, you're black. You can't get a fair trial. Well, okay [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6464.5199999999995s)]
*  We have a federal government to fix that [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6469.4s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6471.8s)]
*  Okay, sorry, I mean i'm getting you you're obviously much more balanced psychologically, but i'm out you have to go crazy if not [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6474.12s)]
*  So how are you feeling? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6481.4800000000005s)]
*  Having gone through all of this. This has been a remarkable conversation. Thank you, by the way [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6483.88s)]
*  But how are you feeling by the prospect of spending seven and a half years in federal prison? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6489.24s)]
*  Um, it's a good question. I think i'm more upset at the impact it's having on everyone else. Um, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6494.360000000001s)]
*  i've [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6500.92s)]
*  I mean no one's gonna i've always been fairly selfless. I think in sort of how I operate [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6502.28s)]
*  um, you know, i'm not excited for it, but uh, you know the impact on michelle the impact on the kids the impact on my [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6506.28s)]
*  family the impact on you know of [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6512.28s)]
*  The ftx fraud on all the customers. I mean those things are much worse. I think i've talked to [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6515.96s)]
*  A number of people that have been through the prison system. And so i've gotten advice on how to do it [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6522.2s)]
*  Um, or what have they said? [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6526.76s)]
*  Well, they sort of assure you it's not as scary as you're feeling like it's going to be right it's it's you're not in with [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6529.400000000001s)]
*  People who committed sexual assault or gang bangers or things like that [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6535.64s)]
*  um [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6539.64s)]
*  You know figure out ways the boredom is what i'm told is sort of the hardest thing to grapple with and you have to find ways [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6540.68s)]
*  To have purpose. I think a lot of people that end up in [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6548.360000000001s)]
*  In white collar crime situations, right their whole life. They felt they did things to have purpose, right people are successful want to have purpose [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6551.08s)]
*  And so you're all of a sudden stripped of your ability to have any real purpose and figuring out how to combat that [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6558.36s)]
*  Um is is one of the key things that people recommend. So how do you do that? [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6564.12s)]
*  I mean, i've got a massive book list i've sort of been putting together [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6570.92s)]
*  And working with people who are going to send me those. Um, hopefully I can teach or provide some educational material [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6575.08s)]
*  I've already helped create so there's this guy named michael santos [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6580.28s)]
*  He was incarcerated for almost 30 years for a small drug possession crime during [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6583.5599999999995s)]
*  um [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6589.24s)]
*  During the war on drugs, um, and he has started a program to help with education [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6590.28s)]
*  And so we together created a course that'll be sent into almost a million prisoners by the end of this year [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6594.599999999999s)]
*  I'm hoping around digital assets and cryptocurrency and this evolving economy. Come on [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6600.36s)]
*  Um, so that was very cool to be a part of and is hopefully going to have some positive impact [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6605.24s)]
*  um, you know, there's [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6610.04s)]
*  It's pros and cons, but the crypto industry has a low barrier to entry, right? [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6612.28s)]
*  And it's I think it's one of the cool things there's people all over the world in every economic class or situation that get to be involved [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6616.6s)]
*  um, and it's a very [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6623.4s)]
*  Unjudgmental community in the sense that you can just self get involved. And so, um, you know, i'm hoping [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6625.46s)]
*  People less fortunate than me who come out of prison [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6631.4s)]
*  Um, this could be something that's hopeful for them, you know, because you get a prison job prospects are terrible [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6634.04s)]
*  You know all these things are horrific the moment you get out [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6639.0s)]
*  And so, you know if this if a couple people could find a meaningful job in this industry, that would be incredible [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6642.28s)]
*  You know as terrible the situation's been for me. There's the people who have it [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6647.64s)]
*  Way worse who go through this system. So, um [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6651.8s)]
*  Are you claustrophobic? [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6655.08s)]
*  No, I actually like small spaces believe it or not. Come on. I do I do [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6656.6s)]
*  It's one of my I live in this very large house right now and it drives me nuts [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6660.68s)]
*  I walk into a room, you know [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6664.44s)]
*  These 10 things need to be fixed in it that i haven't gotten to and I just I don't mind small spaces [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6665.72s)]
*  So I lived in about 400 square feet in hong kong [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6670.28s)]
*  um and loved it loved the apartment so [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6673.08s)]
*  I'm not worried about the space [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6677.16s)]
*  I don't I don't know what i'm worried about to be honest with you like for myself personally. Um, I navigate situations. Well [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6679.16s)]
*  um, i'm pretty friendly with all types of people so [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6686.44s)]
*  You know, it's much it's much worse on everyone who has to deal with my aftermath out here [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6690.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, how is your family dealing with it? Not well, I mean it's hard [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6695.8s)]
*  It's how you know i'm splashed across my local newspaper as like this horrific human being that stole everyone's money and hurt all these people [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6699.16s)]
*  You know all the stuff that I thought was doing good is now perceived as me trying to hide that I was an evil person [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6705.96s)]
*  By doing good [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6711.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, so that sucks. Um [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6713.16s)]
*  You know, yeah, it's terrible for them [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6715.96s)]
*  It's terrible for a lot of people [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6720.04s)]
*  Um, i'm sorry. Yeah, not your has it changed your view of crypto? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6721.64s)]
*  Now i'm a stronger supporter now of crypto than I think I was before so the basis of crypto [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6726.6s)]
*  FTX is in some ways the antithesis of what crypto is right crypto is a decentralized [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6733.64s)]
*  Platform that the network that doesn't need these centralized institutions that sort of doesn't have to deal with the horrific banking industry [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6739.08s)]
*  Which is a horrific industry? [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6745.72s)]
*  And so ftx and binding these all serve as bridges right now between what i'll call the old world and the new blockchain-based world and [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6748.84s)]
*  You know ftx proved the exact thing that a lot of people in the crypto industry are arguing [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6756.6s)]
*  Which is like these centralized powers. You don't know what's going on inside of them. They get too big [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6761.64s)]
*  They get too careless. They obfuscate human lives in this sort of [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6765.96s)]
*  You know, it's big central arena [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6770.04s)]
*  So the basis of crypto is fighting against what ftx was really they're necessary bridges right now, but [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6774.12s)]
*  Uh, I think eventually they won't be so no, I love the crypto industry. I'm not saying there's no issues with it [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6780.36s)]
*  It's not my point at all, but I have a stronger faith in crypto now than I did even before [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6785.96s)]
*  It's really it's an incredible network, I mean i'm not like praying to it every night like some people are but um [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6792.36s)]
*  It's amazing. I mean if you've ever sent cross-border remittance [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6798.52s)]
*  Through a fed wire system or through a bank. It's a horrific process. Yes [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6802.12s)]
*  And the authority that the banks have over [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6806.12s)]
*  What is your asset is? [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6809.88s)]
*  Not good [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6812.2s)]
*  It shouldn't be shocking. Oh, you know try to withdraw [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6814.04s)]
*  You know 25 000 in cash from a bank. Yeah. Yeah, I mean you probably get more money. I get more than 30 agents at your door [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6818.36s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6825.48s)]
*  No, no, I well I couldn't agree more with that [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6826.76s)]
*  I wonder though given your experience just trying to [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6830.04s)]
*  sort of see what you've learned from it like [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6834.12s)]
*  You know you make the people with power mad you annoy them [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6836.6s)]
*  You give you know 20 million dollars to republican candidates in a tightly contested cycle [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6840.4400000000005s)]
*  And they like they wreck you and then they go after the mother of your child [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6846.12s)]
*  You know small child trying to send both parents to prison really on campaign finance violations. It's pretty [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6849.64s)]
*  If you would do that, there's nothing you wouldn't do right? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6855.08s)]
*  so crypto the idea of crypto [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6858.12s)]
*  Absolutely disempowers the banks [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6861.7s)]
*  Single most important institution most powerful in in america. Yeah more more powerful than pharma even [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6864.12s)]
*  Like how can they allow crypto honestly? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6870.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't think the government gets to decide what's well, I couldn't agree more allowed [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6874.280000000001s)]
*  So agree more, you know, there have to be rules. I i'm not anti all regulation, right? [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6879.240000000001s)]
*  There needs to be i'm just saying as a practical matter now that you [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6883.72s)]
*  They sent a guy with a battering ram to your house in suburban dc. Yeah [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6887.56s)]
*  um [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6893.0s)]
*  Like they don't have limits like if you get in their way, they'll crush you [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6894.280000000001s)]
*  Right, they killed they murdered jeffrey epstein actually that actually happened. Sorry it did [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6897.96s)]
*  So how can they allow bitcoin? [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6904.2s)]
*  I mean you have to proceed you have to fight right? You can't not fight [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6907.8s)]
*  But at some point the fangs are going to come out, right? Oh, they've come out the fangs have come out [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6911.72s)]
*  I mean the republicans are fighting against those fangs [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6916.04s)]
*  um, you know, really thank you to ted cruise for initiating that um [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6919.08s)]
*  war but [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6923.320000000001s)]
*  You know, it was interesting and i'm gonna sound crazy when I say this when crypto first started being noticed in dc [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6924.44s)]
*  I was worried that [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6929.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, not worried, but like I thought elizabeth warren was gonna like it. She ran this whole, you know, fake [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6931.4s)]
*  Anti-banking campaign worse of course individual rights, you know this whole thing [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6937.54s)]
*  And I thought republicans are gonna see this as a competition to the dollar and might be [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6942.12s)]
*  More apprehensive to something competing with the dollar. Yeah [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6946.36s)]
*  And so I was like, oh, you know [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6949.48s)]
*  We're gonna have to do some education work on the republican side and then I mean elizabeth comes out pro big bank [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6950.52s)]
*  Anti, I mean it's same with bernie sanders. It's really why they're against the billionaires. They're against powers same with that. Who's that? [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6956.200000000001s)]
*  Sort of mildly attractive but super annoying chick the former bartender from new york. Yeah [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6964.52s)]
*  I can't but I can never remember her real name. But anyway [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6970.68s)]
*  Um, yeah, we're against fighting the power fight the banks, but they're tools of the banks [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6973.160000000001s)]
*  Of course every one of them. Yeah, I mean crypto is a great proof of that. I mean this thing is [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6977.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the quintessential individual rights, you know a network can't be racist can't be sexist can't be anything [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6981.56s)]
*  Like it's it's just math working [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6988.68s)]
*  This should be the dream for people who advocate that that is like true egalitarian should embrace it [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6991.0s)]
*  Love it should love it [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6997.0s)]
*  I mean you can't be denied access to using crypto because you're in the slums or something like that [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=6997.96s)]
*  Are you you know [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7003.72s)]
*  A lot of people go to get bank accounts that don't have a lot of money and they get hit with all these fees and all [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7005.0s)]
*  This crypto doesn't do that. It can't do that. It's a math network that works because math works [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7009.0s)]
*  um [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7014.12s)]
*  Yeah, it should be the dream for these people. I mean [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7015.240000000001s)]
*  They showed their cards completely and now a lot of people pretend it's not true. I think democrats will come around [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7018.4400000000005s)]
*  It's crazy. Well, I watched this we were laughing with this at breakfast with the gary gensler thing [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7023.64s)]
*  I watched some very smart really good people in crypto who I know [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7027.8s)]
*  Big holders of say bitcoin [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7031.719999999999s)]
*  Say well, I think gary gensler's, you know, he's not going to be it. I was like gary gensler [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7033.96s)]
*  First of all, he's just a total tool of the people in charge like that's it like whatever they want. He'll do [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7038.04s)]
*  He's never going to be on your side, but they like were convinced that he was yeah, it's baffling [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7044.36s)]
*  I mean in a dream world, it's not a partisan issue, but the crypto industry didn't make it partisan [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7049.0s)]
*  The the government made it partisan, right? [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7054.28s)]
*  Well, I agree [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7056.759999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I think it's really simple and I have the advantage of knowing a lot less than you do about the details [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7057.639999999999s)]
*  So for me the big picture is clear [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7063.0s)]
*  And it is that this technology is a threat to entrench power [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7066.679999999999s)]
*  Therefore they'll do whatever it takes to destroy it. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7071.88s)]
*  Or try to control it, right? [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7077.719999999999s)]
*  I think they've gotten sort of the u.s government now so binance survived where it was one of the biggest crypto exchanges [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7079.5599999999995s)]
*  But now they're under u.s government surveillance [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7085.08s)]
*  So I think binance is essentially just an extension a crypto extension of of the u.s government at this point [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7087.56s)]
*  So can I just ask is someone who? [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7092.12s)]
*  Believes in freedom whose freedom is about to be taken from him the one of the [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7094.44s)]
*  To me the most intriguing promise most thrilling promise of cryptocurrency was the ability to transact [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7099.16s)]
*  You know any kind of economic trans financial transaction in with privacy [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7106.84s)]
*  It's like nobody's business actually, yeah, it's not it turns out it's not that private though in a lot of ways [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7112.04s)]
*  It's not private in a lot of ways. It's more so who the account holder is is private until it's somehow made public [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7116.36s)]
*  But the transactions are public forever. Yeah by definition by definition. That's the point of the blockchain but the idea [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7123.16s)]
*  That you know, I don't no one has to know like i'm allowed to buy things or sell things without [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7130.5199999999995s)]
*  Everyone knowing about it. That seems like a human right to me. Yeah [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7135.5599999999995s)]
*  Um can will that ever be [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7139.0s)]
*  Made good. I mean there are blockchains that operate that way [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7142.759999999999s)]
*  There are sort of hidden like xmr and there are blockchains specifically built to obfuscate [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7146.36s)]
*  ownership and [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7152.36s)]
*  Ability to review the transactions but in say 20, I mean this is an emerging technology [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7153.88s)]
*  So in 20 years, will it be easy for the average person i.e me? [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7158.2s)]
*  to buy something or sell something using [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7163.48s)]
*  This technology as a currency medium exchange in privately [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7167.4800000000005s)]
*  No, my sense is no it won't be though like the core use of it won't be but it's not private [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7172.68s)]
*  You're it's not private now cash is your most private [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7176.92s)]
*  For sure. That's why they hate it [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7180.200000000001s)]
*  But cash is going away [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7184.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately, i'm not yeah. Sorry the blockchain doesn't solve cancer and every problem [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7186.120000000001s)]
*  Just to be clear it's just a very good network for some specific sets of purposes I know I was just [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7192.28s)]
*  Okay, I I won't throw out my no, I don't think you'll end up a crypto lover at any point in time [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7200.759999999999s)]
*  But well, I want to be that's the thing. I've spoken at two crypto conferences. I like a lot of crypto people. They're smart [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7205.48s)]
*  Some of them are scammers for sure, but a lot of them are just really high-minded idealistic people [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7211.16s)]
*  High iq people who want to make the world better. So I love them [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7216.36s)]
*  Um, I love them. I love michael sailor. I like, you know, a lot of those people i'm so sympathetic to it [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7219.96s)]
*  but I just want it to [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7225.320000000001s)]
*  Give me some privacy. Yes [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7228.280000000001s)]
*  Now privacy you're not going to get I mean you can be private in the sense that no one knows your address belongs to you [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7230.280000000001s)]
*  Right, um, but I don't think it's going to get it's not going to solve the privacy on a large scale [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7236.360000000001s)]
*  Could you fund a because you there is no meaningful? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7242.200000000001s)]
*  Um opposition to the current regime in the united states just isn't there's no organ or a lot of trump voters [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7246.28s)]
*  But they're not organized and they never will be organized because the people in charge prevent them from being organized [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7252.04s)]
*  They tried on january 6th a lot of them are still in jail [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7256.92s)]
*  so [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7260.12s)]
*  Will crypto solve for that? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7261.24s)]
*  Will you ever be able to fund a protest movement that can't be defunded by the people the protest movement challenges? [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7263.5599999999995s)]
*  uh, well, I mean so the [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7271.32s)]
*  You can't stop the transactions from occurring [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7274.04s)]
*  um, and [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7276.36s)]
*  So that's you know, a bank can stop a transaction from occurring. Yeah close your account or things of that sense [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7277.96s)]
*  You can't close someone's bitcoin account [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7282.92s)]
*  And there's tons of different cryptocurrencies. So we're generalizing here a lot, but you can't close someone's bitcoin account. Yeah, let's go so you [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7285.24s)]
*  There that account yes, you could use it to fund a protest that couldn't be stopped now once you have the bitcoin [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7293.32s)]
*  If you want to turn it into cash that could be prevented [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7299.08s)]
*  Um, or if they flag your wallet as being like extremely high risk wallet or associated with something nefarious [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7301.879999999999s)]
*  A lot of other people won't interact with it or won't want to receive from it [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7308.36s)]
*  um, this doesn't completely solve government control [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7312.28s)]
*  But it takes things out of centralized institutions and puts them in your own pocket [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7317.08s)]
*  Which is enticing for a lot of people [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7322.36s)]
*  I think we're going to do a barter economy [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7324.92s)]
*  Um [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7327.32s)]
*  I just I just think it's really important that the people in charge not have a monopoly on the money [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7328.4400000000005s)]
*  Because when they do they will defund any effort to challenge their authority. Yeah, it's anti-america [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7334.92s)]
*  I mean the whole principle completely anti-america doing here. That's right, but [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7340.76s)]
*  I don't know a lot of people don't share that view [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7345.16s)]
*  Well, I just want to wish you truly godspeed and thank you for explaining all of this [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7347.64s)]
*  And anyone who's made it to the end of this interview [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7352.6s)]
*  I think we'll have a completely different as I do view of what happened certainly to you [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7354.36s)]
*  Last question have you [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7360.599999999999s)]
*  Talked to sam bankman freed since all this happened. I have not no i haven't really spoken to anyone [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7362.36s)]
*  So the lawyers do a great job. You get siloed immediately. You can't interact with each other [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-n3vlWxlys&t=7367.4s)]
