# John Rich & Russell Brand Christianity as the New Counterculture, and Neocons Lying Us Into WWIII
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc)
*  One of our plans when we started TCN was to run great long-form content, documentaries and topics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=0.0s)]
*  that other people were ignoring. Well, we have the best so far. It's called Wine in the Sand, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5.68s)]
*  and it's by James O'Keefe, one of the last brave and honest journalists in this country. How brave? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=11.84s)]
*  James O'Keefe embedded with the cartels as they moved migrants engaged in human trafficking at [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=17.6s)]
*  the largest scale in modern times from Latin America to the United States. He embedded with [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  the cartels with hidden cameras and the result is this documentary Wine in the Sand, which we [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=29.04s)]
*  are proud to run exclusively on TCN. Wine in the Sand October 10th, highly recommended. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=34.48s)]
*  Thank you. Every night this is our [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=43.68s)]
*  14th or 15th city and every night I've been traveling with the Sambrosa guys. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=50.0s)]
*  The best, absolutely the best. Thank you all for showing. I'm amazed there's anyone here [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  given the weather. Thank you. I know this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=61.84s)]
*  I've been getting videos all day from my neighbors and people in Florida, and I'm just, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry about what happened and I'm just, I know a lot of you had to drive through the mucks to get [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  here. So thank you very much. I'm great. I'm grateful to be back in Florida. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=80.72s)]
*  Well, I love you too. Thank you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=87.84s)]
*  We went on this tour for a bunch of different reasons. The most obvious being you can't sense [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=92.88s)]
*  a relive event. Mark Zuckerberg can't get in the way. So that's, that's pretty great. Another was [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=97.28s)]
*  to feel better about what's actually happening in the country. Is it as bad as the internet tells [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=104.16s)]
*  us it is? No, not at all. It's a great country filled with happy people despite everything. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=109.6s)]
*  Every city we've been to from the East Coast to the West Coast and everything in between back [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=116.55999999999999s)]
*  to Florida, every city we've been to, we haven't, I don't think I've met one nasty person. Everybody's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=121.52s)]
*  been nice, not just to me, but to each other. And you're just reminded it's a, you know, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=126.32s)]
*  it's a great place and accounts of America's collapse are absurd and probably part of a [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=130.56s)]
*  Psyop that we should not fall for. And the third reason we went on the road was honestly to see [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=136.8s)]
*  what's true. If there's one marker of this moment, it's deception. Oh no, you are hot. I can't even [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=143.52s)]
*  see you. You can't say naughty things to me. I'm a married man. Plus I don't have my glasses on and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=152.08s)]
*  I'm backlit. So all I hear is the darkness barking naughty things at me. But it's hilarious. Thank [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=161.84s)]
*  you. I'm 55 so I'll take the compliment. But it's true. I think every person in this room has had [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=168.88s)]
*  the same moment over the last five years where you realize that something they told you was totally [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=177.84s)]
*  insane. Like you're crazy. You're a conspiracy nut. And then you just realize one day, well, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=183.36s)]
*  actually that's true. And if that's true, what else is true and what else is false? And what else [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=187.92s)]
*  have they been lying to me about? If it's not actually safe and effective, what else is a lie? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  And I doubt there's a single person in this room who hasn't had that experience. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=199.92s)]
*  And you go through stages of it, just like any moment of grief. And the first one is thinking, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=204.64s)]
*  well, you know, am I the only person who realizes what's going on? And you're sitting, you know, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  alone in your den at two in the morning on your phone and you're like, oh, my gosh. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=213.68s)]
*  The whole thing is a lie. It's an op. And you feel like you're going crazy and you think, well, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=219.28s)]
*  maybe no one else sees this. And then you come to an event like this and you look around and all [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=224.56s)]
*  these incredibly nice people and you realize, no, not only am I not alone, not only am I not alone, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=228.32000000000002s)]
*  I'm not weird. I'm not a freak. I'm not a conspiracy nut. I don't care what Wikipedia tells me. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=235.44s)]
*  I'm like a totally normal person. And I know that because everyone sitting around me is a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=244.48000000000002s)]
*  totally normal person. People who like love their children more than anything. That's not weird. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=248.8s)]
*  Not only is that not weird, that's the most normal, wholesome, good thing there is. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=257.12s)]
*  And it's just nice to be reminded of that. But then the next question you have is, okay, if [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=264.0s)]
*  everything I've been hearing is untrue, certainly a lot of the big things are just completely [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=269.68s)]
*  untrue. And no matter how much they yell at me and demand that I believe them, they're still untrue. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't care what you call me. It's not safe and effective. Sorry. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  So the question really becomes, how do I know what's true and how do I know what's false? And [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  that's really the point of tonight. Every single night we've had has had a kind of different point, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=296.8s)]
*  at least in my head, as conceived in the shower. And tonight I've been really brooding on that [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  question, how do you know what's true? And we have two amazing guests. And I think the point [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=307.44000000000005s)]
*  of the conversation will be how do you know what's true and how do you know what's false? And both of [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=312.8s)]
*  them are friends of mine, actual friends of mine, like late night text friends of mine. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  But also men of deep experience in the entertainment business. Talk about a hall [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=321.6s)]
*  of mirrors. You think your world is crazy. And they're men of deep faith, John Rich and Russell [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=325.52s)]
*  Brands. So they'll be joining us and we're going to talk about that. But I just, I was obsessing [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=333.03999999999996s)]
*  over this today because I never watch television. We don't have a television just to try to keep the [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=338.24s)]
*  deception at a low roar in my house. The first thing you can do is throw your television out the window. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=343.28s)]
*  And then once it's on the ground outside the second floor window, jump on it and then run [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=350.08s)]
*  your truck over it and then set it on fire. And that is a good first step toward getting closer [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=354.64s)]
*  to the truth. In other words, don't just get rid of it but destroy it in a symbolic way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=362.0s)]
*  Offer it up as an offering to the gods of truth. You're going to kill your television. But I happen [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  to be in a hotel room where they come standard and you're not allowed to destroy them because [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  this isn't actually Led Zeppelin 1977. You don't get to throw them out the window onto the pool deck [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=378.32s)]
*  because you get arrested. So I didn't. And I turned it on just to see what they were saying, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=384.56s)]
*  what lies they were telling. And I sat there slack jawed as they explained to me totally seriously [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=388.88s)]
*  that the real threat that former President Donald Trump faces is from Iran because they're trying [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=395.12s)]
*  to kill him. They're trying to assassinate him. And everyone on the screen says, oh yeah, Iran's [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=400.8s)]
*  the threat. I'm thinking, I mean, I don't know anything about Iran. I'm sure they're threatening. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=406.0s)]
*  I'm sure they're bad. Not here to endorse Iran. Hardly. Having spent three years being called a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=408.96s)]
*  puppet of Putin, I just want to say ahead of time I'm not a puppet of the Ayatollah, whatever his [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=415.52s)]
*  name is. Not a Shiite. So I'm not carrying water for the Ayatollah when I say that that's probably [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=421.44s)]
*  not true. And how do I know that's not true? In fact, it's so not true that it was a little [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=430.64s)]
*  bit baffling watching all these kind of serious looking national security experts on the television [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=435.44s)]
*  telling me, oh no, it's Iran. And my tip off was, well, they've tried to kill Trump twice in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=440.8s)]
*  past six weeks and it wasn't Iran. In fact, the last guy who tried to kill Trump was a neocon, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=446.24s)]
*  actually. The same people who want more with Iran. In fact, how do I know he was a neocon? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=457.6s)]
*  Because he literally moved to Ukraine to fight. Okay. So he had exactly the same politics as [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=463.28s)]
*  Lindsey Graham. Not attacking Lindsey Graham. I'm just saying. So there was that guy and then, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=470.32s)]
*  boo, boo, boo. Okay, I'm not, you know, fine. But he wasn't Iranian. Again, not carrying water for [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  the Iranians. I'm probably one of the few people in this room old enough to remember the 1979 hostage [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=486.55999999999995s)]
*  crisis. I never thought I would be defending them. But in this narrow way, I will say they [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=492.16s)]
*  didn't do that, nor did they climb onto the roof of the building 130 yards away from Trump during [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=496.64000000000004s)]
*  a rally in Butler Township earlier this summer and take a shot at him, shoot him in the face, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=503.20000000000005s)]
*  and kill the guy right behind him. That was not the Iranians. That was a liberal. And he was allowed [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=509.12s)]
*  to do that because the Secret Service, which is controlled by the Biden administration, let him do [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=515.76s)]
*  that. Okay. So you can say, well, are you alleging a conspiracy? No, I'm just telling you what [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=521.2s)]
*  happened. I've spent my life at events controlled by the Secret Service because I cover politics. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  And I can promise you that no one with a range finder is allowed through the magnetometer [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  because a range finder is for shooting people. So when you carry a range finder through and they [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=537.76s)]
*  bust you but then just let you do it, and then they let you crawl up onto a roof 130 yards away [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=542.88s)]
*  with a two, two, three, they're letting you shoot the guy. And that's exactly what they did. And [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=548.48s)]
*  nobody for some reason wants to say that, but it's just a fact. So you can, you know, you can draw [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=554.32s)]
*  whatever conclusions you want, but the one conclusion no honest person can draw is that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=562.72s)]
*  Iran is doing that. No, Iran's not doing that. The Biden administration did that. And the people [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=567.44s)]
*  who tried to kill Trump are Democrats. They're not Iranians. Okay. And so it speaks to a larger [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=573.44s)]
*  problem, which is even now 21 years after they told us Saddam had weapons of mass destruction, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=581.84s)]
*  spoiler, he didn't. Four years after they told us that, you know, the COVID virus came from a [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=589.12s)]
*  pangolin, which by the way, not to be, you know, a walking desk reference here is a mammal that was [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=597.84s)]
*  somehow being sold in a seafood market. Remember that? It came from a pangolin. Oh, of course, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=605.76s)]
*  there's a pangolin, another pangolin-born virus, something we dealt with a lot growing up in [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=612.72s)]
*  Southern California. I remember my mother saying, just be careful of the pangolin. You got to cook [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=617.6s)]
*  them. You know, it's kind of a classic vector for coronavirus, the pangolin. Stay away from the [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=621.84s)]
*  pangolin burger or get it at least medium well. A pangolin, right. It didn't come from the biolab [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=628.1600000000001s)]
*  400 yards away that was funded by Tony Fauci. Definitely not. Remember they told us that. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=635.6800000000001s)]
*  And if you're like, wait a second, wasn't there a biolab right there? Getting US taxpayer funding, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=642.72s)]
*  working on gain of function to make the coronavirus more dangerous? Shut up. Kind of like when they [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=648.4s)]
*  announced it in a Senate hearing on television that there are all these biolabs in Ukraine, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=656.0799999999999s)]
*  you're like, wait a second, what do you have biolabs in Ukraine? Shut up. Conspiracy theorists, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=660.24s)]
*  no, you just said that. Shut up. Racist. Racist. I thought the Ukrainians were, wait, shut up, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=665.28s)]
*  anti-trans guy. Okay. Okay. That all happened right in front of us. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=675.28s)]
*  Then like just take the shot, it's totally safe and effective. Once you take it, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=684.0s)]
*  you can't get COVID and you definitely can't transmit it. Really then, how come you have [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=687.52s)]
*  COVID, Tony Fauci? Shut up. You're trying to kill your grandmother. I like my grandmother. Shut up. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=694.0799999999999s)]
*  Okay. So all of us saw all of that happen. At a certain point, you've got to think the people [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=700.0s)]
*  telling you to shut up, shut up racist, that group, they might not be telling the truth about [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=705.7600000000001s)]
*  everything. Just throwing that out there. Like maybe Lindsey Graham's not totally on the level. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=710.96s)]
*  And yet today they're telling us that Iran is really the threat. It's not the threat that we [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=718.08s)]
*  see right in front of us, which is them. The ones who let them shoot Trump. No, it's a country that [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=723.12s)]
*  most Americans couldn't find on a map. It definitely must be them. And really the only solution to this [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=730.4s)]
*  is to go to war with them because the one thing we definitely need is more pointless foreign wars [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=736.88s)]
*  that we're going to lose. Okay. And you start to realize two things. One, they're not very creative [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=742.16s)]
*  in their lies. They'll just go back to exactly the same lies. And when they do tell those lies, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=748.88s)]
*  everybody whose job it is to kind of screen for lies, all the gatekeepers, all the fact checkers, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=753.36s)]
*  the guys who run Wikipedia, the Snopes people, they'll all sort of nod and be like, yeah, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=758.08s)]
*  that's right. That's totally true. And unfortunately a lot of people just will sort of believe it. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=763.28s)]
*  Like some people don't seem to be learning the lesson, which is you have to decide for yourself. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=769.28s)]
*  And the first line of defense when you're deciding whether something is true or false is just common [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=774.0s)]
*  sense. Does that make sense? Does that make sense? And here's one way I judge it. So if the Biden [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=777.44s)]
*  administration, which controls not just Trump's security, but also his access to classified [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=785.84s)]
*  information, because they control the intel agencies. So if the Trump campaign wants to know [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=791.44s)]
*  what's going on, they have to rely on the Biden administration to find out. And if they want to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=795.6800000000001s)]
*  protect themselves from that threat, they need to rely on the Biden administration to supply security. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=799.12s)]
*  That's actually how our system works. I don't think that's a wise system, just saying. But if [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=802.88s)]
*  what they were saying is true, then they would, if they really believe Donald Trump was at risk [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=808.4s)]
*  of being shot out of the air with a surface-tier missile, that's what they're telling us now, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=814.56s)]
*  or being assassinated by his Iranian sleeper cell, because I know my neighborhood has quite a few, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=817.68s)]
*  then they would be providing additional security, right? But they're not. They're providing so little [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=824.64s)]
*  security that he can't have outdoor rallies because they're withholding security. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=830.96s)]
*  He had to cancel an outdoor event in Wisconsin last weekend because they wouldn't provide enough [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=837.2s)]
*  security. But if you actually believed that one of the most famous, the most famous person in the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=840.4000000000001s)]
*  world, the guy who's ahead in the polls, whatever they tell you, Trump is ahead. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=846.72s)]
*  The man most likely to be the next president was at risk of being murdered by a foreign power you'd [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=853.52s)]
*  provide enough security. And if you didn't have it, because they were running around the country [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=861.1999999999999s)]
*  protecting Dr. Jill, which is what happened in Butler, Dr. Jill was under grave, grave threat. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=865.28s)]
*  A lot of people are trying to stop Dr. Jill before she heals again, because as a doctor, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=873.68s)]
*  that's what she does. Dr. Jill, don't get me going. How can one woman's ego trip control a nation of [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=877.4399999999999s)]
*  350 million people? It's kind of amazing. But anyway, but if you really believe that and you [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=889.5200000000001s)]
*  didn't have enough security because they were with Dr. Jill at a diversity conference in Knoxville, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=894.96s)]
*  you would bring in the National Guard or maybe the hundred and first airborne, you would use [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=899.36s)]
*  the military to protect the future president from murder by a foreign power. But they're not doing [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=904.6400000000001s)]
*  that. They're saying this is happening. The threat is so high that you can't appear outside, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=910.48s)]
*  but we're not going to help you protect yourself with security that you pay for. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=919.6s)]
*  I'm thinking this is not on the level because that doesn't make any sense at all. And if it [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=925.84s)]
*  does, tell me how it makes sense. And this is true of virtually everything they say. It's not hard to [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=929.6s)]
*  determine whether it's true or false because you just assess it on the basis of first grade logic. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=935.36s)]
*  And that's true for almost everything. And they know it's true. And that's why they spend so much [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=942.4s)]
*  time trying to convince you that you're insane and try to convince you that your senses don't work, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=947.52s)]
*  that actually they hand you a hamburger that smells like a dog bomb and they're like, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=954.64s)]
*  no, it's really good. It smells like dog crap. I'm not eating that. You must eat it because [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  it's delicious. But I feel like I'm going to vomit when he can see me shut up and eat it. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=963.12s)]
*  There's something wrong with your palate. There's nothing wrong with your palate. Your nose works [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=969.36s)]
*  fine. You know what's good or bad. You know what's right or wrong because you're born knowing. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=974.08s)]
*  All of us are. We were born knowing what's right or wrong. Our moral code is no different [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=978.96s)]
*  substantially from the moral code that Hammurabi wrote thousands of years ago because it's in us. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=987.52s)]
*  We know. And so the trick is to convince you that you don't know that you need Dr. Jill or somebody [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=994.1600000000001s)]
*  else with a fake credential to know what's right or wrong. And you absolutely don't. You don't and [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1001.6s)]
*  no free people does. You are allowed to decide for yourself on the basis of your values, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  your senses, and above all, your instincts. And I tell my kids this all the time and I really mean [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  it. Your instincts are designed to protect you. They were given to you by God at birth with one [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1022.96s)]
*  job. And that job is not to get elected to some stupid statewide office. There's no senator [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1029.68s)]
*  instinct. They're not trying to sell you a reverse mortgage. Your instincts are not trying [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1036.24s)]
*  to get rich. Your instincts only exist to protect and serve you. That's it. They're the most reliable [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1042.4s)]
*  guide you have. So trust them. Despite all the noise and all the noise, if you actually think [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1049.36s)]
*  about it, and it's my job to think about it, all of it, all of it is designed to get you to ignore [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1056.16s)]
*  what's obvious. What's obvious. And they do that for two reasons. One, there's a certain power trip [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1061.84s)]
*  involved in lying to people in a way that's so obvious they know it's a lie but making them [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1068.72s)]
*  believe it anyway because really only God can do that. And that's what they loved about COVID but [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1073.04s)]
*  it was so clear that everyone who got the shot was still getting COVID. They totally got off on [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1077.52s)]
*  preventing you from saying that because that's true power. It's easy to fool someone. It's much [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1083.36s)]
*  harder to get someone to repeat a lie he knows is a lie. Right? And that made them feel powerful. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1089.36s)]
*  So that's the first thing. The second thing is they try to make you feel like there's something [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1095.76s)]
*  wrong with you, that you're in some weird minority of people, like some freaky subcategory that just [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1099.9199999999998s)]
*  doesn't want to castrate kids. What? You don't want to castrate kids? What's wrong with you, man? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1105.4399999999998s)]
*  This country was built on child castration. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1112.64s)]
*  We wouldn't have an America without child castration. Like what? And you're like really? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1116.8s)]
*  Is that really a weird view? Yes, it is. You cannot allow them to do that. And as I always [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1123.2s)]
*  tell my kids, you know. For example, if you're talking to someone and you get the creepy vibe, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1129.84s)]
*  like Tim Walz, I'm just throwing that out there. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1137.6s)]
*  I've never met Tim Walz. But the first second I was like, man, I don't have enough evidence [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1142.64s)]
*  to indict you. I'm not going to. Okay? But you're a creep. I went to boarding school in New England [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1149.12s)]
*  in the 1980s. You were my dorm master. I know exactly who you are. I know exactly who you are. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1155.84s)]
*  There's no reason for you to be in the shower, Tim. Please leave. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1162.24s)]
*  I felt that so overwhelmingly from him. And then I thought to myself, maybe I'm being unfair. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1166.24s)]
*  No, I'm not. Again, I'm not going to accuse him of anything specific. I have zero evidence. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1171.84s)]
*  And I'm not going to bring charges against him because I can't. Right? That's a process [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1177.76s)]
*  that requires proof. I don't have proof. All I have is my spidey senses and they're never wrong. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1181.9199999999998s)]
*  And if I feel like you're a creep, I don't know exactly what you're doing, but you're doing [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1188.48s)]
*  something, you weirdo. Because I can smell it. And I always tell that to my children. Don't [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1191.76s)]
*  anyone convince you you're wrong. You're never wrong. Don't attack the person. Just get away fast [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1198.08s)]
*  and don't get into his van ever. That's fair, right? I don't care if it has heart shaped [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1204.32s)]
*  windows and funny bumper stickers. Don't get into his van. The same is also true for deception. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1210.72s)]
*  I don't know what you're lying about, but I know you're lying. I can feel it. All of us [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1218.8s)]
*  have that power. We were born with it. We can smell deception and we know when someone's telling [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1222.64s)]
*  the truth. We can't always prove it. Usually I can't prove it. But if you've ever been around [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1228.24s)]
*  someone who's saying something you've never thought of before but it's true, it hits a different way. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1233.68s)]
*  It hums like a tuning fork. You can feel it inside. That's true. I never heard that before. I have no [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1239.3600000000001s)]
*  evidence that that's true. I've never even thought of that. That is true. I know that's true. The [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1245.92s)]
*  truth and whoever's yelling yes, yeah baby. Because that's the feeling you have inside when [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1251.76s)]
*  you hear something that's true. And they're always like have the fact checkers assessed? [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1258.24s)]
*  That's not a Wikipedia. That's not true. The CIA hasn't vetted that. That's a conspiracy theory. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1262.8s)]
*  Okay. It's still true. So this is creepy, but it's true and it's worth knowing. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1270.08s)]
*  Every time you use the internet you are being watched. You are not alone. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1278.4s)]
*  Private businesses do it. Government actors, our country and others. All of it. Internet traffic, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1282.96s)]
*  including yours, is mined like a precious commodity. It's bought and sold and it's used [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1289.2800000000002s)]
*  to manipulate what you think, what you buy and yes even how you vote. It's a big deal and it's [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1293.2800000000002s)]

*  or private browser window. Don't fool yourself. They're watching you always. So if you think that [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1315.68s)]

*  traffic through secure servers. So they can't see it. Because we use ExpressVPN our internet [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1337.6799999999998s)]
*  providers cannot see our browsing history. Simply put we've got nothing to sell because they don't [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1344.8s)]
*  have anything on us. That's important to us. It's probably important to you too. So if you think [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1350.24s)]
*  internet privacy only matters to drug traffickers, people who are doing shady things, think again. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1355.36s)]
*  Privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. No privacy, no freedom. And the truth is we have all seen how [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1361.36s)]
*  activists and power-hungry government actors have tried and succeeded in getting people fired [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1367.6s)]
*  or even thrown in jail for saying the wrong thing or having the wrong opinions. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1372.56s)]
*  Protecting your personal data is essential. It's the beginning of reclaiming your freedom. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1376.56s)]
*  ExpressVPN hides your IP address. That's a number that reveals your actual identity on the internet. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1382.8799999999999s)]
*  It's unique because we hide our IP address with ExpressVPN. Data brokers can't use it to build a [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1390.32s)]
*  profile on us to sell off to marketers or other governments or our own government. That happens too. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1396.96s)]
*  By the way, hiding your IP address is really useful when you want to appear to be somewhere [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1403.52s)]
*  you're not. And that's your prerogative by the way. We used it in Moscow to get our reporting [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1408.08s)]
*  out of the country. We've used it around the world. We always use it. You could also use it to access [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1412.8s)]
*  geo-restricted content from anywhere. So if you're in a country that doesn't allow you to use an app, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1418.32s)]
*  you can with ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN has several locations in over a hundred countries around the [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  world. That's like having a hundred different passports right on your phone. So I'm not a tech [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1428.0s)]
*  expert, obviously, and if I can use it, you can too. It's really easy. You just tap one button [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1435.2s)]
*  and you're connected. They have apps for every device you own or even potentially own. iPhone, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  any kind of phone, laptop, tablet, even your smart TV. Anything that uses the internet can use [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1445.76s)]
*  ExpressVPN. ExpressVPN has been rated number one by CNET, The Verge, and a lot of other tech reviewers. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1452.08s)]
*  We have it. You should too. Right now, tuckercarlson.com listeners can get three extra [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1459.04s)]
*  months free at expressvpn.com slash tucker. That's E-X-P-R-E-S-S-V-P-N dot com slash tucker for three [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1464.08s)]
*  extra months for free. Well, God bless you. And that's exactly where that power comes from. It [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1473.12s)]
*  comes from God. That's exactly right. As I always say to my children, your instincts are imprecise, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1481.6s)]
*  but they're unerring. I don't know exactly what you're lying about. I don't know what you're [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1492.2399999999998s)]
*  hiding. I don't know what your freaky secret is. I don't want to know actually. No interest at all. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1496.9599999999998s)]
*  But I know you got one, and I know you're lying to me. And I'm at this stage in my life, at my [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1502.0s)]
*  advanced age, having cycled through a few jobs in my time. I've decided I'm just going to say that. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1508.0s)]
*  I'm going to say that because I really believe it. And I'm never again going to sit there and [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1515.52s)]
*  let them tell me that Iran is the greatest threat. When I've been to most cities in this country, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1520.0s)]
*  and they're falling apart, and Iran didn't do that, you did it. You did it. Our leaders did it. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1525.28s)]
*  The people who run this country let their country die. The mullahs didn't do that. I'd love to blame [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1530.64s)]
*  the mullahs. I wish a war with Iran would fix Reading, Pennsylvania, and Gary, Indiana, and [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1535.2s)]
*  Philadelphia, and New York City. I really wish that. That would be easy. Just beat Iran and [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1540.32s)]
*  prosperity and self-respect return. No problem. We've got the weapons systems for that. But it's [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1546.64s)]
*  much more insidious, and it's much more obvious. The people who run this country don't care about [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1551.68s)]
*  the people who live in the country. It's literally that simple. And if they did care, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1556.64s)]
*  if they did care, they'd have the view, I'm sure, of every single person in this room, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1562.4s)]
*  which is I'm not defending Iran. I'm sure it's terrible. That's why I don't live there. I live [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1567.2s)]
*  here. And what I care about is here because I was born here, and my parents are buried here, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1570.8000000000002s)]
*  and I will be too, and my children will live on here because we're Americans. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1575.68s)]
*  And we want this country to thrive. And so our focus, our attention, our love, [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1580.4s)]
*  is focused on our nation and how its people are doing. That's what we care about. And that's the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1587.3600000000001s)]
*  lens through which we make all judgments. Is this good for my country? And by my country, I mean [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1593.3600000000001s)]
*  me, my neighbors, my wife, my children, everyone I know. My generations yet unborn, I'd like them to [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1598.48s)]
*  be born in this country and live the life that I have lived. Will the decision make that possible? [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1606.4s)]
*  Will it help them? And if it won't, I'm not for it. And by the way, anyone who is for it [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1611.52s)]
*  is not my friend. This is not simply a disagreement. You're my enemy. If you don't care about me, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1617.44s)]
*  if you're willing to walk around this country full of the best people there are, I've been all over [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1624.0s)]
*  the world, I can promise you, this is the nicest country by far. You get lost in America, I'm lost. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1629.44s)]
*  Try being some like tourist from a foreign country who can barely speak English. It doesn't matter [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1636.48s)]
*  what country, actually. It can be Liberia or Belgium. It doesn't matter. You show up in some [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1640.3200000000002s)]
*  town in Oregon, you know, or even Massachusetts, kind of rough, but even in Massachusetts. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1645.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm totally lost, you say in broken English. And they're like, oh, go this way. They'll help you. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1652.4s)]
*  Try being a dog in America. No country has ever treated dogs better than America. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1658.0800000000002s)]
*  And if that's not a measure, when you're a dog in America, you've won the dog lotto. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1663.1200000000001s)]
*  Try being a dog anywhere else. It's a dog's life. Right. Well, try being him. Right. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1669.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, that's true. Things are changing in certain parts of Ohio. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1682.4s)]
*  And the dogs know that and they're distressed, trust me. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1688.88s)]
*  They're like, you can get eaten there. We're out. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1693.0400000000002s)]
*  By the way, when Trump said that, which was the single greatest thing Trump has ever said, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1698.24s)]
*  everyone hated that debate. And a lot of Trump voters hated that debate. You know, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1703.8400000000001s)]
*  a lot of people who like Trump really hated that because they like Trump. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1707.28s)]
*  And they want him to do his best. And then he comes out and he's just, you know, pretty Trumpy. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1710.4s)]
*  No, don't say that. You know, and but if you look at the numbers here, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1714.72s)]
*  he actually did pretty well after the debate. You know what I mean? It's almost like watching [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1719.68s)]
*  your kid play soccer. You're too emotionally invested in it. Come on, Dylan, make the kick. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1724.16s)]
*  And like, no one else notices. Only you. Cause it's your kid. That's how I think a lot of Trump, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1730.48s)]
*  they want him to be, you know, they love him. So they want him to do great. But actually he [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1735.04s)]
*  did pretty well after the debate according to the numbers. And one of the reasons he did [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1738.88s)]
*  is because Americans are just not for dog eating. I'm sorry. They're not. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1742.64s)]
*  And they can tell you they get all hyperventilating and all hysterical. Shut up. There's no dog eating, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1745.6000000000001s)]
*  which is exactly the moment you know, Oh yeah, there's some dog eating going on. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1753.04s)]
*  100%. How do I know that? Cause the liars said it's not true. That's why. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1758.16s)]
*  Chances they're eating dogs in Springfield, Ohio. 100%. 100%. I bet my house on that. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1764.64s)]
*  Cause Wikipedia says it's a conspiracy theory. Done. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1773.44s)]
*  I'm out of control. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. But the point is, the point is, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1780.0800000000002s)]
*  sorry. By the way, most people know that. That's why the moment that just appalled David Muir, [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1791.1200000000001s)]
*  I've been in journalism for 33 years and I can promise you he was a very good journalist based on [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1799.2s)]
*  his abs. It's so funny. It's like, imagine going into any business out of self-love. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1805.68s)]
*  It's just not a good motive. You know what I mean? Cause you want to look at yourself on camera. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1814.16s)]
*  Every shot of David Muir is like admiring his biceps. He's doing this slow rotisserie turn. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1818.16s)]
*  What a douche. Anyway, he was, it's like a joke. It's like a joke. Only when you work at ABC News [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1822.56s)]
*  do you not know that everyone else thinks you're absurd. Luckily I have an ever present knowledge [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1835.04s)]
*  of you being considered absurd because I know that I am. And I know that I am cause I've been [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1841.12s)]
*  in hotel rooms for 17 straight nights and they have mirrors outside the shower. And every time [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1844.8799999999999s)]
*  I emerge from the shower, I'm like, I'm kind of impressive. And then I see myself like, what is [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1849.52s)]
*  that? There's like some lumpy primate standing in my bathroom. Like what the hell? And it's such a [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1852.96s)]
*  wonderful, it's horrifying obviously, but it's such a wonderful moment because you are a lumpy [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1860.24s)]
*  primate actually. And it's so good to know that. It's so good to see yourself in perspective. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1867.52s)]
*  No matter how right you think you are, fundamentally you're absurd cause you're not God. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1874.4s)]
*  And I do think that we should install a series of mirrors outside David Mears bathroom [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1878.88s)]
*  and all of them, Wolf Blitzer and all the Wolf Blitzer. All right, Wolf, let's see you naked. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1884.88s)]
*  I'm serious. Like nobody looks good. I mean, it's just a fact. I don't, I'll just say it, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1892.4s)]
*  but they don't know that they don't. And it's so embarrassing. Anyway, the point is when someone's [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1898.48s)]
*  telling the truth, you know, it's true. Don't second guess your instincts. They're the greatest [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1905.76s)]
*  gift you've ever been given. And on the basis of them, tell the truth yourself and tell it without [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1912.24s)]
*  fear. It doesn't matter what they call you. It doesn't matter how loud they yell. When you're [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1919.04s)]
*  telling the truth, you know, it's true. And everyone around you knows it too. And there's [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1924.96s)]
*  nothing more liberating than that. And so I hope you will. And so with that, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1930.56s)]
*  I want to invite the first of two guests. So we're going to have my friend John Rich, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1936.1599999999999s)]
*  who's actually a wonderful man. In addition to being an amazing performer. And then we're going [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1941.28s)]
*  to invite our friend Russell Brand, but first my friend from Nashville, Tennessee, John Rich. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1947.76s)]
*  How about a round of applause for America's number one Patriot, Tucker Carlson? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1953.76s)]
*  I don't know. That's you. It's either you or Ted Nugent. I say it's you though. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1964.4s)]
*  I think it's definitely Ted Nugent. Honestly, I love, I love uncle Ted. Been to my house. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  Wonderful man. So, um, you are one of the few people I've been brooding on this truth or [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1973.92s)]
*  falsehood question all day long. You are one of the few people I've ever known, and I'm proud to [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1980.08s)]
*  be your friend, um, who doesn't ever seem to struggle with this question. What's true and [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  what's false. You seem to know it and you seem to trust your intuition on this question. Is that [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1989.6799999999998s)]
*  true? And if so, why do you trust it? Well, humans don't really have inherent intuition. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=1995.28s)]
*  In my opinion, there's a thing called discernment. Preach discernment. Uh, discernment is what [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  King Solomon asked for. And you know, as the Bible says it, that Solomon was the wisest man that [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2012.32s)]
*  ever lived. Well, okay. If that's the case, I want to learn about what he was all about because I [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2019.04s)]
*  could use some wisdom in my life as well. And when you see what Solomon was asking for, he could [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2025.84s)]
*  ask for anything. He didn't ask for more money. He didn't ask for more power. He said, give me [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2031.36s)]
*  discernment. I want discernment. I want to be able to tell what's true and what's false. And I think [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2037.9199999999998s)]
*  in this world we're living in today here in 2024, it seems like everything is a lie or a version of [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2045.04s)]
*  the truth. However you want to put it, even from a lot of Republicans that are out there spouting [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2054.32s)]
*  it off and you're, and you're looking at that going, you see them say something and you go, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2060.48s)]
*  that does not seem true to me. I don't know what's not true about it, but it doesn't seem that way. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2067.92s)]
*  So my suggestion would be if it doesn't seem true to you, it's not true. Just go with that. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2072.0800000000004s)]
*  Don't try to talk yourself out of that. It just hits you in the gut wrong. It's just something [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2081.36s)]
*  about that's not right. So people are thirsting for truth. I think that's why they're showing up [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2087.36s)]
*  in crowds like this to hear you speak because they know that you're not working for anybody. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  Nobody owns you and you're just saying the truth. That's it. The truth is the greatest commodity ever. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2098.7200000000003s)]
*  I do think unemployment makes you more honest if that's what you're saying. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2106.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. You can definitely lie your way into another great job anytime you wanted to. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2110.16s)]
*  No, thanks. I don't think I'm in danger of being snapped up by CNN. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2115.92s)]
*  So what do you, I mean, you live in Nashville, you're in the entertainment business, but you're [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2122.72s)]
*  very, more than any singer, songwriter, entertainer I've ever met, you're very connected with what, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2128.48s)]
*  you know, a lot of people, everyone I ever meet, it's like, knows you. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2134.24s)]
*  Where do you think we are in this race, the presidential race, which is 30 odd days away? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2138.24s)]
*  Where are we at in the presidential race? I think Trump's going to win. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2144.24s)]
*  Now, my personal thoughts on it are this. The more it looks like Trump is going to win, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2152.9599999999996s)]
*  the more danger the country is in. Because the other side, this, you're not just looking at, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2162.56s)]
*  if they lose, they're losing the White House. They're in big, big trouble if he gets in there, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2169.12s)]
*  again, because let me ask this crowd a question. Do you feel like you're somewhat even of a [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2178.16s)]
*  different person than you were four or five years ago as to what you know now? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2185.44s)]
*  Right? I think COVID was the big catalyst for that, Tucker, that, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2190.32s)]
*  listen, I was a guy that said, well, if you're a Republican, you're a good guy. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2200.1600000000003s)]
*  That's how I felt. If you're a Republican, you're a good guy. If you say the right thing in the [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2204.48s)]
*  interview, yep, if you say what I think, I'm behind you, man. Let's go. And then COVID comes [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2209.76s)]
*  along and we see how we were manipulated, lied to, and the catastrophic results of those lies, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2216.72s)]
*  what that yielded in our population. And we saw our own party doing that and realized, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2224.72s)]
*  hang on a minute. You mean to tell me that this guy that I've always thought was a real McCoy [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2231.68s)]
*  is in the pocket of big pharma? What? That can't be true. You remember having that experience? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2238.8s)]
*  That cannot be true. It can't be. It can't be. And then as time goes by, you realize, oh yeah, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2247.76s)]
*  it is true and it is true as a heart attack is true. And then you start to step back from the [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2256.16s)]
*  whole thing and go, hang on a minute. I think this whole thing is playing we, the people [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2262.48s)]
*  to their own end, which is something horrible. And so now I don't think I like these guys anymore. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2269.6s)]
*  And then they start seeing we, the people standing up out of their chairs and starting to flex their [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2277.52s)]
*  muscles and go, hang on a minute now. No. And then you see the intensity of the pushback start to [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2283.28s)]
*  kick in. Don't you hear they started arresting grandmas for praying outside of an abortion clinic [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2290.0s)]
*  where you see them. Listen, I've been to the Capitol many times. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2296.32s)]
*  You know, they have magnetic locks on those doors. The doors are this thick, you know, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2300.96s)]
*  and they're magnetically locked. I mean, I mean, you can't get in and they swing those doors open [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2306.8s)]
*  and say, come on in guys. And here come all the people going, wow, I can't believe I never thought [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2314.32s)]
*  I'd see this before. Arrest, arrest, arrest, arrest, arrest, arrest, throw them all in jail [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2319.28s)]
*  with no habeas corpus. Forget excessive bail, no bail. It would be tantamount to in Nashville, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2324.2400000000002s)]
*  if I saw a guy standing up on the street outside of my house and I said, open the front gate. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2333.84s)]
*  I said, hey buddy, come on in. And he did. I said, follow me to the front door. And then I took the [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2340.4s)]
*  locks off the front door and open the front door. And I said, come on in the house, man, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2348.32s)]
*  go anywhere you want to go, check the place out. And he goes meandering through my house. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2352.48s)]
*  And about the time he's up on the second or third floor, I come up there and I aim a rifle at that [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2357.76s)]
*  man. I said, get on the floor. I'm called the cops. You're under arrest. And I throw that man [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2363.28s)]
*  in jail. He goes, what are you talking about? He opened the gate, the front door asked me to come in. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2368.8s)]
*  Now I'm in jail for invading his house. That's right. That's what that is. Agree? [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2373.6s)]
*  Well, not only do I agree, I mean, the videotape is now public. We've all seen it. Yes. And that's [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2381.92s)]
*  literally what happened. So I think when you see things like that play out in the, in our country, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2388.96s)]
*  listen, don't take this the wrong way, but it feels like the USA has become the USSA to me. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2394.8s)]
*  The people running this country, people ask me all the time, I'm out on the road playing music [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2403.04s)]
*  and stuff, just regular people. John, why do you think people in this country [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2408.56s)]
*  are going out of their way to destroy it? I mean, make that make sense. I said, because the ball [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2414.48s)]
*  game that they're playing is way bigger than the USA, that if they can get the USA to come down, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2421.52s)]
*  remember this Tucker, nobody ever reaches forward standing on their own two feet for a handout, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2428.7999999999997s)]
*  ever. They only reach for a handout. They only reach for a lifeline when they're down on their [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2436.3199999999997s)]
*  knees and they're in this position right here. Please help me. Please make it save my life. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2441.36s)]
*  I'm about to die. Save me, save me, save me. They reach up. Well, the only way you can get that to [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2447.04s)]
*  happen in America is you got to put us down on our knees all the way down on the floor down with [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2453.04s)]
*  our faces down. And it's a life or death situation. And we'll accept anything that they offer to us [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2458.16s)]
*  just to make it stop. And I really think what their goal is, is to inflict so much pain and misery [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2464.24s)]
*  on this country that at some point America's down on its knees. And even the most patriotic among us [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2471.44s)]
*  will say, just make it stop. And when you do that, they got you. And I think that's the game [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2478.56s)]
*  they're playing. I think it's much bigger than politics at this point. I don't think there's any [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2484.32s)]
*  doubt about that. So this is a stressful time here. The kids going back to school vacation is over. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2487.84s)]
*  It's the height of a presidential election season. There's a lot going on. You need a good night's [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2493.2s)]
*  sleep, but it's never been harder to get it. So we're talking about this in the office the other [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2498.64s)]
*  day. And a couple of people who work here were raving about a product called 8 Sleep. And I [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2503.36s)]
*  wanted to know more about it. It turns out that temperature has a lot to do with whether or not [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2510.96s)]
*  you sleep comfortably and wake up feeling rested like you actually slept. Now, the makers of 8 [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2514.96s)]
*  Sleep Pod figured out that if you make a climate controlled mattress cover, you can add to your [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2520.08s)]
*  existing bed. You don't have to buy a new bed, just the cover that it changes everything. You get [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2524.4s)]
*  far fewer problems with falling asleep and staying asleep. And so you feel rested the next day. Sleep [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2529.6s)]
*  actually has its desired effect. The 8 Sleep Pod can be used to warm up or cool off your bed. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2535.04s)]
*  And that matters because temperatures change seasonally. We have climate change in this country. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2541.2000000000003s)]
*  It's called winter. And so you can feel comfortable all night long. It even adjusts to different [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2546.08s)]
*  preferences on either side of the bed, which might be helpful in your relationship if you have one of [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2550.4s)]
*  those relationships where the different partners want different temperatures. And those are pretty [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2555.44s)]
*  common. The 8 Sleep Pod has been studied. It's been proven to improve people's sleep and health. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2559.44s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg's into it. Elon Musk on the other side. Many others use this product, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2565.28s)]
*  including people here. So try it. Go to 8sleep.com. Use the code TUCKER to get [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2569.52s)]
*  350 bucks off the pod for Ultra. Recommended. So you had one of the most amazing things I've [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2574.96s)]
*  seen in a long time. You wrote a song pretty recently on a specific theological topic, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2583.92s)]
*  the Book of Revelation, which if you'd said to me, okay, there's a country music star, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2595.04s)]
*  been in the business 30 years, and he's going to write a song in the Book of Revelation, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2599.76s)]
*  and it's going to go to number one in the United States, I would have said, I don't think that's [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2603.44s)]
*  possible of all books of the Bible, by the way. They don't even teach that book in the [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2608.72s)]
*  Episcopal Church or really any book in the Episcopal Church. But anyway, but the point is, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2613.68s)]
*  we got to get you into a Pentecostal church. I'm headed there, man. But anyway, the point is, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2620.3199999999997s)]
*  get you in there. How do you, I mean, what was that? That song, it was the biggest song in the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2625.52s)]
*  United States. Like how did that happen? Well, first of all, thank you for having me on your [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2630.56s)]
*  show to break that song, because that's where everybody learned about it. Even my normal [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2635.12s)]
*  outlets in the news that would normally have me on to sing my new song would not have me on to [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2640.72s)]
*  sing that song. I'm not going to ask you to be more specific, but I think I know what you're [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2646.24s)]
*  talking about, John Rach. Well, I said, well, why can't I come sing that song? And they said, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2649.68s)]
*  it's just, it's too graphic. It's too graphic. And I thought about, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2655.8399999999997s)]
*  about, well, this is a channel that'll air a car crash live. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  Right. Well, what's so graphic about it? It's literally out of the pages of the book. It's [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2665.44s)]
*  the Bible itself. I just made it rhyme. That's all it is. But I think the line that got them was when [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2670.48s)]
*  it said, brimstone upon their heads and millstones around their necks. They'll feel the shaking when [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2675.92s)]
*  the trumpet sounds and no matter where they hide, they'll be nowhere to run. When Jesus puts his [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2683.36s)]
*  mighty foot on the ground, that tore them up. They didn't know what to do about that. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2690.16s)]
*  Christians have got to realize that Jesus was not on the defense. He was on the offense the entire [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2699.44s)]
*  time. He was on the offense, speaking the truth to these people that a lot of them got turned around [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2708.48s)]
*  and saved, but the hierarchy and the elites that he spoke the truth to murdered him. Jesus was not [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2715.28s)]
*  murdered for something that he did. He was murdered for things that he said. He was murdered for [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2722.2400000000002s)]
*  freedom of speech. They murdered him. They beat him half to death and they hung him up on a cross [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2727.52s)]
*  and bled every last drop of blood out of that man. And he allowed them to do it. If you want to know, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2734.8s)]
*  if you're a Christian, this audience, who you actually follow, who is the son of God? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2741.28s)]
*  The son of God could have evaporated the earth with a flick of his pinky. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2746.8s)]
*  And he did not do that. He allowed them to torture him to death on behalf of us. So who are we to [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2754.32s)]
*  lose our nerve in these times that we call tough times? Who are we to lose our nerve right now? If [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2762.0s)]
*  that's who you follow, then follow him. Follow his example. Be on the offense. Speak the truth. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2768.56s)]
*  That's it. The second thing I'd like to say about that, Tucker, a lot of Christians are under the [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2774.88s)]
*  misconception that, well, God's not going to let anything bad happen to me. Where do they get that [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2781.6s)]
*  idea? They get that idea from preachers because preachers like to preach that, hey, nothing bad's [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2787.68s)]
*  going to happen to all of us because he loves us too much to allow us to go through anything bad. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2795.44s)]
*  And that keeps the churches packed and that keeps the offering plate packed. And then I go, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2802.7200000000003s)]
*  really? You should have told that to Daniel back in the day when Nebuchadnezzar invaded Israel. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2809.36s)]
*  You know what they did to Daniel? I'm sorry. Is anybody in this room better than Daniel? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2815.36s)]
*  Raise your hand if you find yourself to be higher than that man. Nobody, right? Daniel. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2822.64s)]
*  Nobody? I didn't see a hand. Daniel's sitting there and guess what Daniel was? Daniel was a patriot. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2829.44s)]
*  He was a Hebrew patriot. He was ready to fight Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians to the death. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2837.3599999999997s)]
*  He was ready to go. Nebuchadnezzar comes in there, takes over Israel. They put Daniel in chains and [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2842.48s)]
*  all of his friends castrate him and all of his friends and throw him in a pit. Daniel. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2849.92s)]
*  And then as time goes by, many years, Daniel winds up being the only guy that can interpret [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2860.16s)]
*  the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar. And so Nebuchadnezzar starts to raise him up in the hierarchy of that [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2867.04s)]
*  empire. And basically Daniel became the second in command of the Babylonian empire, but not before [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2872.64s)]
*  he was dragged off in chains and castrated in front of all of his friends. What about Job? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2878.8s)]
*  What about Job? Did Job have some pain in his life? I think so. What about Noah? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2886.6400000000003s)]
*  Did God rapture Noah out of the flood or was Noah directly in the flood, but he had a boat? [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2895.36s)]
*  Noah, there's a flood coming. Build a boat. Noah's like, what? He goes, trust me, build a boat, Noah. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2902.64s)]
*  The verse preceding that, Tucker says, it says, and God was grieved because he had created [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2912.96s)]
*  mankind in the first place. That's how polluted the earth had become, how wicked it had become. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2920.96s)]
*  And what it says in Revelations is that it will be as it was in the days of Noah, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2927.68s)]
*  so shall it will be at the end. And so you go, well, what was it like in the days of Noah? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2932.72s)]
*  Well, the whole earth had been polluted to the point where God said, I am grieved that I even [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2937.9199999999996s)]
*  made mankind in the first place. What a statement from him. I should have never done this. And then [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2943.7599999999998s)]
*  it says, but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord. That doesn't mean he pulled Noah out. He [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2952.08s)]
*  said, build a boat, Noah. Noah goes, okay. So he starts building his boat and it took him a couple [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2957.28s)]
*  of hundred years or so to build it, being scoffed at and scorned the entire time, spit, spit at, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2963.28s)]
*  called every name in the book. And he just kept hammering, kept building it, kept going, kept [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2969.1200000000003s)]
*  going. And then here comes the flood. Now, do you think Noah was really excited when the rain started [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2974.8s)]
*  to pour and the water started gushing out of the ground and the earth started to get flooded? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2980.0800000000004s)]
*  Every human being he ever knew in his life, even the wicked ones that were his next door neighbors [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2984.32s)]
*  that he might've shared some goats milk with or whatever, being a good neighbor, they're all going [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2989.04s)]
*  to be gone. You think he was really excited and feeling great about life at that point? I bet he [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2993.52s)]
*  was scared to death when that started happened and the boat starts to float and go up and up and up [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=2999.44s)]
*  in the same flood that destroyed all the wicked raised Noah to safety. And he got to start over [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3005.04s)]
*  again. Now, if God is the same yesterday, today and forever, and his word does not change, which [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3011.12s)]
*  is what the book says, that means we change and culture changes, but he does not. So who are a [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3017.2799999999997s)]
*  bunch of fat, lazy American Christians think they are that they're going to be able to escape [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3024.24s)]
*  what's coming? You can survive what's coming, but you can't escape it. And that's what preachers [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3029.8399999999997s)]
*  don't preach. That's, that's why people think that they're going to escape all this. You asked a great [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3035.3599999999997s)]
*  question. That is why they think that. And that's a dangerous place to be in mentally, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3040.32s)]
*  because when things do get hard, you're not going to recognize them for what they are. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3045.52s)]
*  So it sounds like you're saying that part of the deal is suffering [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3050.48s)]
*  and you can't lie to yourself about that. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3054.88s)]
*  You can lie to yourself about anything. Yeah, I actually have. Yeah. No, I mean, who am I? I've [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3059.92s)]
*  got to listen. I've got a high school diploma. I grew up in a double wide trailer in Amarillo, [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3067.28s)]
*  Texas. My dad spent his life preaching in prisons and in Mardi Gras on the streets of this country. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3071.76s)]
*  I do not come from some hierarchy family, but I think that's where a lot of us come from. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3079.2000000000003s)]
*  The truth is not complicated. It's just difficult to get your head wrapped around because it is so [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3087.28s)]
*  abrupt when you finally run into it. You can't hide from it when you finally see what it is. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3093.44s)]
*  Most people don't want to talk that way. Tucker will. That's why he got fired. That's why a lot [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3100.4s)]
*  of stuff's happened to him. But it's also why this room is full of people right now, because you want [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3105.2000000000003s)]
*  to hear the truth. Just tell me the truth. It is infuriating to know that every day you wake up, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3109.44s)]
*  everything you hear is either a straight ahead lie or a twisted version of the truth. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3120.0s)]
*  To your question earlier, how am I supposed to know what's what? That's where discernment comes [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3126.0s)]
*  in. But you have to ask for that. Human beings do not innately have discernment. That's not [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3130.72s)]
*  something we have. You have to ask him for it, like King Solomon did and many others. And if [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3136.88s)]
*  you do ask him for it and you're serious about it, he'll give it to you. He will let you know [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3142.4s)]
*  when somebody is a liar and somebody's telling you the truth. He will let you know when you read [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3148.56s)]
*  something or you're trying to read the tea leaves, which is what literally everybody in this room and [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3153.6s)]
*  around our country trying to do right now, put together all these jigsaw puzzles, try to figure [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3159.76s)]
*  out what's about to happen. He will help you with that. Isn't that great? Because who are we? Like [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3165.2s)]
*  this little tiny grain of sand on the world's largest beach, but he cares about each and every [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3171.44s)]
*  one of us individually. It's so powerful. If you can ever get your head wrapped around that man, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3176.32s)]
*  your life will get better quickly. Quickly. I hate to ask you, but can you play a few bars of that [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3181.36s)]
*  song? Can I play what? A few bars of revelation. Oh, I can play that. Yeah. You want, you want to [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3189.28s)]
*  hear that? You want to hear some music? So Tucker, I've been watching these, these events you're [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3194.88s)]
*  doing. I haven't seen, I saw Kid Rock come out. He didn't sing anything. No, he didn't. Well, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3200.88s)]
*  I'm getting ready to one up Bob right now. All right. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3206.32s)]
*  Let's see what I got. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3215.76s)]
*  I will tell you this before I play this song. I wrote the song at the end of 2023. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3223.6000000000004s)]
*  It was, if you watched our interview, I didn't set out to write it. It was, it was an unofficial [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3230.0s)]
*  download. It was an unapproved download that hit me on this song. I picked up a guitar and I started [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3236.8s)]
*  writing this thing. And then it was, well, what do you want me to do with this, man? I mean, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3243.44s)]
*  seriously, like Tucker said, you're going to put out a song about a book of the Bible that most [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3247.28s)]
*  people won't even flip to. That's what he told me to do. So I did it. And as I started taking my time [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3250.8s)]
*  with it, I said, well, how am I supposed to interdo this to the world? And the person that came to mine [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3258.8s)]
*  that would be the absolute greatest, if you could ever get him to do it was Tucker Carlson. If he [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3264.1600000000003s)]
*  would do that, that's probably the biggest intro on the song. So thank you. That's how I felt. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3268.5600000000004s)]
*  You texted me. I went for it. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3276.0s)]
*  Oh, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3288.8s)]
*  dancing in the flames, the people cursed his name, bowed at the altar of the father of lies. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3295.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a number to their days and all their evil ways. Lord's gonna turn away from all their cries. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3305.52s)]
*  Oh, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3319.1200000000003s)]
*  because the king is coming. The king is coming back again. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3330.4s)]
*  Oh, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3335.84s)]
*  brimstone upon their heads, millstones around their necks. They'll feel the shaking when the trumpet [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3341.2000000000003s)]
*  sounds. No matter where they hide, there'll be nowhere to run. When Jesus puts his mighty foot [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3349.6800000000003s)]
*  on the ground and says, Oh, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3359.44s)]
*  I can feel it coming like a dark train running. Oh, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3366.32s)]
*  because the king is coming. The king is coming back again. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3376.4s)]
*  When judgment comes like a lightning flash, their voice will wail and their teeth will gnash. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3389.92s)]
*  He'll set fire to the evil ones and all the wickedness they've done. There'll be no time [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3396.96s)]
*  to turn around as the stars begin to hit the ground and the mountains fall and the veil is torn [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3403.44s)]
*  with the sound of that seventh horn. Oh, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3410.08s)]
*  revelation, I can feel it coming like a dark train running. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3415.6s)]
*  Oh, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3426.24s)]
*  Oh, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3426.72s)]
*  because the king is coming. The king is coming. Oh, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3430.9599999999996s)]
*  revelation, I can feel it coming like a dark train running. Oh, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3438.9599999999996s)]
*  Oh, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3447.52s)]
*  because the king is coming. The king is coming back again. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3451.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3456.96s)]
*  So wrote the prophet John before his days were done. The king is coming. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3472.2400000000002s)]
*  John, rich, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. Amazing. Amazing. Thank you. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3487.2s)]
*  So I want to bring someone else out on stage and I was thinking about it today and I've been on the [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3497.36s)]
*  road for like 30 years, just covering stuff and whenever we're in a different city anywhere, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3504.08s)]
*  anywhere, really, we always have a dinner and I always try to invite, you know, as many different [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3508.64s)]
*  kinds of interesting people as possible. Often people have got, seem to have nothing in common. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3513.36s)]
*  We once had a dinner party with Alex Jones and Steve Inskeep from National Public Radio. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3518.7200000000003s)]
*  Steve Inskeep was horrified. But anyway, the point is, it's interesting to have different kinds of [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3527.92s)]
*  people. But one thing I've noticed in the past five or six years is that people who would seem [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3532.96s)]
*  to have nothing in common at all, sometimes do have deep things in common. And I feel that way [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3537.6s)]
*  about our next guest, Russell Brand, who is from a completely different world. Movie star from [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3545.52s)]
*  England was on what I thought was the left. And I wound up believing that I had everything in [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3553.8399999999997s)]
*  common with Russell Brand. And then of course I found out today that Russell Brand and John Rich, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3561.12s)]
*  who are from polar, you would think, sort of different poles in our society are also friends [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3564.88s)]
*  because we have everything in common. And which is to say, their values are totally aligned. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3570.7200000000003s)]
*  And you're seeing that a lot. As the world goes crazy and we're filled with sadness watching it, [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3577.6s)]
*  the institutions we grew up with and loved and trusted crumble or betray us. The flip side of [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3583.52s)]
*  that, the compensation for that, the good in the world is that our relations with other people [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3589.76s)]
*  become deeper and more real and more honest. And we realize actually that things we thought [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3596.2400000000002s)]
*  divided us are totally irrelevant. And what matters is who we really are. And so [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3603.44s)]
*  with that as the backdrop, I want to invite my friend, John's friend, Russell Brand. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3610.1600000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Russell. So to give the audience some sense of how much things have changed, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3615.04s)]
*  I met Russell in his dressing room a couple hours ago and he said, would you come and do a [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3628.96s)]
*  podcast with me? And I thought, I don't know, I thought we were going to talk about the news [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3633.44s)]
*  today. And I get there and there are three crackers and two cups of grape juice sitting [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3638.08s)]
*  on the table. And I'm thinking Russell and I don't drink. So I'm like, is that wine? No, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3646.0s)]
*  it's grape juice. What is that? And he said, we're going to have communion. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3649.68s)]
*  Which I loved. I don't think we would have been doing that three years ago. Russell, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3655.68s)]
*  how did you get to a place where you're having communion in the green room at the arena in Fort [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3660.16s)]
*  Lauderdale before the show? It's been an unusual week. Well, I feel that I've been saved. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3664.64s)]
*  As we were discussing earlier and as becomes increasingly evident, we're no longer discussing [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3681.92s)]
*  trivial material, ideological or economic differences. We are discussing spiritual [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3691.04s)]
*  warfare and the necessity for absolute victory, the absolute necessity for absolute victory. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3698.24s)]
*  And as we have to overcome the dead former person in each of us and transcend, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3707.12s)]
*  the same must happen, I suppose, for our culture. It seems that we're at a critical point where [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3714.72s)]
*  tweaks and measurements and levies and tariffs will be insufficient when it appears that a [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3720.64s)]
*  diabolical opponent is concealed behind the mask of globalism. This must be confronted in your [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3726.96s)]
*  country and in mine and across the world. And frankly, John Rich and I have had [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3733.28s)]
*  enough of it and we've decided to wear a uniform. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3739.92s)]
*  Well, yeah, I did notice that. We're starting a band. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3742.7999999999997s)]
*  It's going to be good, Tucker. I'm a little out of step because I... Wait, you know what? If you're [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3750.7999999999997s)]
*  going to be in our band, there's something you need. Do you guys like my boots? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3755.7599999999998s)]
*  Now listen, I don't even think he wears socks. He's some kind of hippie guy living in the woods. I [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3760.7999999999997s)]
*  don't know. But Tucker, I thought you were an 11 and a half, but I found out you're actually a 12 [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3765.7599999999998s)]
*  and a half. Not to brag. Not to brag, but your feet are pretty big. So I don't know if I could [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3771.04s)]
*  hand these over to you, but if you're going to be in the band, you need some of those redneck Revere [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3777.6s)]
*  boots, buddy. Those are 11 and a half. So maybe we... I could send you a pair that fit. Maybe [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3783.6s)]
*  we should give those away to the audience tonight. Somebody wants them. I don't know. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3792.08s)]
*  Maybe we'll have a raffle after. Join us backstage for bingo after the show. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3796.16s)]
*  Those would look good on your feet. They would. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3801.4399999999996s)]
*  Those are amazing. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3803.12s)]
*  I don't know. If you're going to be in the band. I mean, Russell, when are we going to write our [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3805.7599999999998s)]
*  first song, man? That's the real question. Probably over the course of the evening, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3808.8799999999997s)]
*  I would have thought to celebrate the wonderful people of Fort Lauderdale. Well done surviving [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3812.24s)]
*  that hurricane. Well done surviving everything. This whole thing is a country song. This whole [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3817.68s)]
*  thing is a country song. Yeah, yeah, right. It is totally. You see everything in terms of country [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3822.56s)]
*  songs. We're like the beginning of a joke. Like the three of us walk into a bar and... [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3827.52s)]
*  I'm a bystander in a check shirt, but it's the two guys in the black Nashville shirts. I love it. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3830.8s)]
*  What I like about John Rich, if I may have a moment of your time. You may. Oh, please. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3839.12s)]
*  I don't know. Did any of you see when John Rich was on Jordan Peterson's podcast? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3845.52s)]
*  And like Jordan Peterson's quite an intense person. I think you'd agree. So like if Jordan [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3850.64s)]
*  Peterson's coming to your house, you don't think, oh, there's that mild mannered, gentle fellow, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3856.56s)]
*  Jordan Peterson's quite intense, isn't he? But John Rich out intense Jordan Peterson. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3861.12s)]
*  God accept Christ as your savior. Accept him now. Well, no, I did earlier today. I was, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3869.44s)]
*  I accepted Jesus earlier. Actually, I've been thinking about this. No, accept him as your Lord [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3874.56s)]
*  and savior. You're not being Christian enough. Put these goddamn boots on. March to Calgary right [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3879.28s)]
*  now. Kneel before the cross. Well, no, I've actually written a book, Wrestling with God. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3887.84s)]
*  It's taken quite a lot of time. It's quite an endeavor. You're not Christian enough. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3893.28s)]
*  Calm down, John. We're all trying our best. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3900.2400000000002s)]
*  Unless it's actual rapture and battles between the archangel Michael and Satan, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3903.28s)]
*  John nods off to sleep. True. I'm watching this. It's so good. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3911.92s)]
*  So where would you say we are? Fort Lauderdale. I knew I'd get one eventually. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3921.84s)]
*  I saw it. They're fine people, aren't they, Tucker? You can't keep them down. You can't [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3929.6s)]
*  oppress them. You can lie to them. You can belittle them. You can try and take away their God, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3934.56s)]
*  but they will rise up, these people. They will withstand hurricanes. They will overwhelm lies. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3939.6s)]
*  You can try to put a pastiche of phony joy on, a parade of grins and of patronization. Turn the [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3948.24s)]
*  page. But the people of Fort Lauderdale are already awake. Amen. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3956.7999999999997s)]
*  Get her done. Get her done. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3970.24s)]
*  I always ask you this in public and in private, but I can never control myself. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3977.2s)]
*  When was the moment you found yourself awake? This is me. Because you've had John on. John's [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3981.12s)]
*  done an intense song and everything. His Revelations song. So it's difficult, I think, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3988.4s)]
*  when you interview a musician and the musician does their song, you have to sort of just go, [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3992.72s)]
*  well, John's going, revelation, there's an angel coming back again. Hey, well done. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=3999.52s)]
*  It was amazing. He is amazing. Is that the Rage Against the Machine version of what I said? [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4007.92s)]
*  Russell, come on. It's going to work this band eventually, I think. Try and get the boots on now. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4014.4s)]
*  What are you going to play? I mean, frankly, I was just going to stand in the background and [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4018.6400000000003s)]
*  hope that not to get overwhelmed by it all. Now, when did The Awakening happen? And The Awakening [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4025.1200000000003s)]
*  is continually happening, Tucker, isn't it? Because this is a, I suppose I will say this. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4029.76s)]
*  When we have these conversations and you sort of say that you're from the right and like you've [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4035.84s)]
*  worked in legacy media all those years. And actually when I'm talking to John Rich on a [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4040.16s)]
*  recent podcast that we chatted, me and John, I love John because I love his intensity. You look at [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4044.8s)]
*  him, he's like, even now I can feel his eyes boring into me. You're not being Christian enough. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4050.8s)]
*  I'm trying. This is as Christian as I can be. It's not good enough. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4058.48s)]
*  I'm not like, I'm from England, so I don't know what goes on in, you know, I don't understand your [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4065.84s)]
*  country. I don't understand anything. You know, if it was like, I thought it was fantastic when [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4072.16s)]
*  Barack Obama became president of your country. Well, that's fantastic. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4077.04s)]
*  Fort Lauderdale, Fort Lauderdale. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4083.6s)]
*  Well, because I thought, what a wonderful indication of the progress of this nation. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4087.2s)]
*  2008, you will recall that there was a terrible financial crash across the world and that the [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4095.4399999999996s)]
*  instigators of this economic nightmare, which continues to affect people, not only in this [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4100.8s)]
*  country, but across the world, ought to have led to a reckoning of financial systems, ought to [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4105.5199999999995s)]
*  have led to a reckoning of the type of elites that managed to maraud unseen behind visual [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4113.36s)]
*  government. If there is a power that is veiled, it is the power that goes unchecked when events [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4120.0s)]
*  like 2008 take place. I never would have considered myself a person that would have even conceived of [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4125.84s)]
*  voting for a Republican of any variety. For me, my memories of the Republican Party is like [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4135.28s)]
*  George Bush and Cheney and Iraq war and weapons of mass destruction and needless loss of lives [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4140.0s)]
*  of Americans and Iraqis and British people and people across the world as a result of those [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4147.6s)]
*  conflicts. We're now beyond partisanship. As I said last time we spoke, when Tulsi Gabbard and [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4151.68s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy joined the MAGA movement, it became clear to me that what we're dealing with is [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4158.96s)]
*  beyond the typical political taxonomies. This is indeed something deeper and more profound. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4166.8s)]
*  I feel that there's a kind of attempt to mask in language lies and words something very, very [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4175.28s)]
*  powerful, malfeasent and nefarious behind these bureaucracies that legislate and control, that [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4183.12s)]
*  tail and limit, prohibit and break down institutions that seem sacred and timeless, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4189.679999999999s)]
*  ineffable, difficult to understand and impossible to decry. I never thought that we would reach a [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4196.16s)]
*  point where I'd find myself saying in this election something has to be done to disrupt [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4203.44s)]
*  what's happening. So when you say like awakening, I've awoken from being a drug addict, I've awoken [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4210.5599999999995s)]
*  from thousands of obsessions and compulsions and now what I've awoken from is the idea that people [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4218.72s)]
*  that talk about protecting the vulnerable have any concern other than the maintenance and exertion [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4225.04s)]
*  of further power. I think it's happening in my country, I think it's happening in your country, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4230.96s)]
*  I think it's happening in France, in Canada, across the world masquerading under the auspices [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4234.96s)]
*  and library of liberalism is something darkly authoritarian and anything that can disrupt it, [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4240.320000000001s)]
*  prevent it or stop it proceeding I think is vital. So awakening I think is like an ongoing [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4246.56s)]
*  thing Tucker. We hear a lot from viewers about big tech censorship and those reports are more frequent [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4254.0s)]
*  than ever right now. Censorship meaning shutting down your access to information, not lies or [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4260.96s)]
*  misinformation but true things. It's only the truth that they censor, facts that get in the way of the [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4267.04s)]
*  lies they're trying to tell you. The net effect of this of course is interfering in the 2024 [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4273.68s)]
*  presidential elections, that's why they're censoring more than ever now because the stakes [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4279.360000000001s)]
*  are even higher. You're probably not shocked by this but the specific examples of it do throw you [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4282.64s)]
*  back a little bit. We've seen screenshots and videos showing how a google search learned more [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4288.160000000001s)]
*  about the attempted assassination on Donald Trump instead push users to information on Harry Truman [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4292.56s)]
*  or Bob Marley or the pope, anything other than the relevant truth which is that they just shot [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4298.88s)]
*  Trump in the face. They don't want you to know that because it might help Trump. We've seen examples [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4305.28s)]
*  where Facebook marked true photos of a bloodied and defiant Trump as misleading. Somehow those [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4310.64s)]
*  pictures were a lie and then limited their visibility. Its AI assistant explicitly denied [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4316.24s)]
*  the shooting ever took place. This is insanity but it's at the core of big tech's editorial policy [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4320.88s)]
*  which is denying the truth to you in order to control the outcome of this presidential election. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4326.08s)]
*  That's not democracy. We've seen examples where a generic search for information about Donald Trump [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4330.88s)]
*  was automatically rephrased to show positive stories about Kamala Harris instead. Is there [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4335.68s)]
*  any clear example of election interference? So what do you do about it? Well, Parler has been down [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4341.76s)]
*  this road. Parler's pulled right off the internet for telling the truth but it's back and it's [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4350.32s)]
*  reaffirmed its lifelong unwavering commitment to free speech. On Parler, the Bill of Rights lives. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4354.96s)]
*  The First Amendment is real. You can say what you think because you're a human being and an American [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4362.16s)]
*  citizen and not a slave. On Parler, users can freely express themselves, tell the truth, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4366.24s)]
*  express their conscience and connect with others who are doing the same and they will not be [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4372.0s)]
*  interfered with. They will not be censored. Designers support a wide range of viewpoints. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4376.08s)]
*  Everyone is welcome on Parler. Parler is committed to ensuring that everybody is heard and so it's [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4381.52s)]
*  become a place where independent journalism is protected and respected. It's protected because [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4387.280000000001s)]
*  it's respected. So as this censorship by big tech intensifies, standing up for your God-given right [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4392.64s)]
*  as an American to say what you think is essential. We're on Parler. That's why we're on Parler. Our [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4400.0s)]
*  handle is at Tucker Carlson and we encourage you to join us there. You have the right to say [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4405.6s)]
*  what you believe. So does every American and you can do it on Parler. Get the Parler wrap today. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4411.28s)]
*  You became a Christian and you were baptized several months ago. It does seem like you're [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4417.2s)]
*  not the only one. It seems like people, while I speak for myself, who grew up in a completely [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4425.84s)]
*  secular world are all of a sudden seeing that there's more out there than our five senses can [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4430.4s)]
*  perceive. Do you sense some kind of Christian awakening in our society in the West or is that [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4436.88s)]
*  my imagination? I don't think it's your imagination, though you've got a wonderful imagination Tucker. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4448.08s)]
*  No one would deny that. That's true. I was listening at the side of the stage to John's [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4452.32s)]
*  beautiful song and for a moment I did consider that perhaps, and I suppose people are pondering [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4459.28s)]
*  this now, maybe we will be alive for the return of Christ, for the physical actual return of [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4466.32s)]
*  Christ, for the second coming. Because I can't imagine how long things could go on being so [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4473.5199999999995s)]
*  subtly Luciferian without opposition. Yeah, it seems like there's a Christian awakening. Yeah, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4480.32s)]
*  it's evident the more that I learn, the more that I read scripture, the more that I listen to people [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4486.799999999999s)]
*  that know a lot more than I do about this subject and the Lord alone knows there's enough of them, [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4490.88s)]
*  the more it seems plain and evident to me that we are at some kind of precipice, at something of [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4495.36s)]
*  a reckoning. I don't know what it's going to augur, I don't know what will be born, I don't know what's [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4502.0s)]
*  coming forth, but something in me believes that it is not the dystopia that is being currently [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4507.679999999999s)]
*  imposed. I think that something significant is happening. Like when at my earlier encounters of [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4515.28s)]
*  Christianity, I felt like it was a sort of a placebo, a panacea, a palliative, a kind of [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4521.2s)]
*  offering to dumb you down and to distract you. I don't know how I managed to avoid the deep and [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4529.5199999999995s)]
*  profound truth. I don't know how, I suppose it's because of this, like we were discussing earlier, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4536.0s)]
*  if someone says to you, do you believe that God came to earth in the form of a man and died that [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4539.84s)]
*  you could be forgiven and redeemed and rose again, that you may live in eternity? My rational mind [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4546.96s)]
*  coached as I have been by a culture, the apostasy I commit now is the apostasy of a culture that [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4554.16s)]
*  increasingly we're realising is appalling and disgusting. Every day there's another story, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4561.28s)]
*  whether it's Epstein or tales of Hollywood, corruption and debauchery. For me, to go beyond [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4566.8s)]
*  what my rational mind, such as it is, can understand, to believe in order that I can receive, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4576.48s)]
*  to believe and accept that Christ died for me, that he died for each of us individually, [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4582.5599999999995s)]
*  died for all of us collectively, that that's beyond my comprehension because my comprehension [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4588.08s)]
*  is so limited, it's been, it has brought me a peace beyond all understanding. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4593.28s)]
*  So I love, I want to ask each of you, I want to ask you to flesh that out and John for your [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4599.68s)]
*  response, you said, you sense that the dystopia that's building and it's obvious I'm not even [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4607.84s)]
*  going to describe it, but the centralization of power, the intense anti-human impulses that our [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4613.68s)]
*  leaders seem to have, the main goal seems to be to hurt people, prevent them from having children. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4620.88s)]
*  By the way, if someone doesn't want you to have children, he hates you. That's the measure. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4626.0s)]
*  When you love someone, you love your children, you want them to have children. If you don't want [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4631.92s)]
*  people to have children, you hate them. Really simple. So you see all of this happening globally [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4634.56s)]
*  at the same time and you feel like, wow, in 10 years, this really is going to be a totalitarian [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4639.36s)]
*  global state. But you're saying you feel that's not actually the future. In your gut, you don't [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4645.68s)]
*  think that's going to happen. Yeah, I can't believe that that is what's happening and that's not [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4650.48s)]
*  what's prophesied. Everything that's unfolding, and again, I'm very new to this, you know, like, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4657.5199999999995s)]
*  I've only been Christian six months. I've been under quite a lot of pressure. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4664.32s)]
*  But them apostles hadn't been doing it long, had they, John? They were out there getting amongst [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4675.44s)]
*  it, spreading the good word, trying to save the world. And for me, yeah, it's very much the [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4679.28s)]
*  Christianity of Revelation, not the Roman 13 that tells you to obey the government. I don't know who [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4683.28s)]
*  slipped that in there. I'm very much... This is it. This is what we're here to do. This is it. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4690.0s)]
*  It's happening. It's unfolding before us. So, can I... What was the question, Tucker? Because I've got [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4700.24s)]
*  so excited about the people of Fort Lauderdale. The question was... I mean, we're in a nice hockey [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4706.88s)]
*  rink. There was a glimmer of hope. There's cowboy boots on the stage. How are we to make sense of [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4710.32s)]
*  this? You're wearing gingham, as usual. I only have one shirt and I wear it every day and I'm [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4717.2s)]
*  really happy with it. I wear it fishing, shooting, sitting on stage. It's the all-purpose shirt, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4724.0s)]
*  highly recommended. No, we spend our lives, you and I, John has a much more decent life, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4729.12s)]
*  but we spend our lives describing everything that's terrible and where this is going. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4735.6s)]
*  You offered a glimmer of hope and you said, I can't imagine that there isn't victory. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4740.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, this is what I'm saying. Something so profound and unusual has happened [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4746.320000000001s)]
*  to me. I've spent my life hedonistically. I've indulged in epicureanism. I've experienced a lot [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4752.96s)]
*  of the things that the culture tells you you're supposed to do. Get famous, enjoy... Yes, sir, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4761.52s)]
*  absolutely. Are you still expecting an ice hockey match? It's difficult for me to contextualise that [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4766.8s)]
*  at this distance. What I would say is, why do I feel optimistic about this? Because my belief in [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4774.160000000001s)]
*  Christ is beyond the rational mind. It is a feeling of a rising God present in all of us. It is the [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4781.84s)]
*  knowledge that I am forgiven, that we are all forgiven, that none of us are pretending to be [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4788.88s)]
*  perfect. None of us are trying to hold ourselves up to the measurements of this culture, that [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4792.72s)]
*  transcendence and the revelation is available to all of us right now. Why do I feel optimistic [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4797.52s)]
*  about it? Because something very strange is happening, I think, when I find myself in Fort [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4802.56s)]
*  Lauderdale, sat between Tucker Carlson and John Rich talking about Jesus. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4807.28s)]
*  Jesus. Yeah, he'll work it out. We don't have to do anything anyway, do we? We can just relax here [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4811.36s)]
*  and try and force Tucker Carlson into those shoes. You brought up the word dystopian. I think in a [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4823.04s)]
*  lot of our minds, we read the book of Revelation and we envision what the world must look like [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4830.96s)]
*  when that book is playing out and it looks like an apocalypse movie to us. But it won't look like [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4835.76s)]
*  that. It does not say that. It says back to Noah, as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be at [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4841.4400000000005s)]
*  the end times. And it says in the days of Noah, they were eating and drinking and marrying and [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4847.92s)]
*  giving in marriage. They were going on with regular life. The world was not falling apart. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4854.16s)]
*  It was just wicked. And Noah was living in the middle of that. So it's not going to look like [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4858.72s)]
*  some apocalypse movie before he comes back. It's going to be, they're not going to like us very [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4863.84s)]
*  much. Anybody that won't submit or bend to the will of this empire that's going to come up there, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4869.360000000001s)]
*  I think we're watching being built right now, they're not going to like us very much, but it's [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4874.96s)]
*  not going to look like some apocalypse movie. Isn't that interesting? And the truth is, and I'll stop, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4879.2s)]
*  but the Lord wins. He wins in the end. He destroys all of them and we win with him. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4884.96s)]
*  So that's the victory. It happens at the end. You just have to go through the, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4894.4800000000005s)]
*  you have to go through the rut to get there. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4898.0s)]
*  Oh, why I like what John Rich just said, if I may tell you Tucker, even though I know you were here [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4899.68s)]
*  and you're just there and he's there look. It's like that. What I liked is John Rich was describing [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4903.92s)]
*  worldliness, mundanity, banality. And what I'm experiencing is the kind of banalization [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4909.12s)]
*  and desacralization of everything. You're right. It isn't like sort of some roaring and demonic [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4915.92s)]
*  hellscape. It's a sort of crushing ordinariness. It's a crushing mundanity. It's the crushing of [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4922.96s)]
*  the spirit that your life is sort of trite and rote. And here you are, devour your gruel and [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4928.48s)]
*  stare at your sticky screen endlessly. Like it's not even that dramatic or barbaric. You're right. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4934.96s)]
*  It's the mechanical tedium of a global bureaucracy that sees everything as data, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4942.56s)]
*  that would patent seeds, that would patent life itself, that would see ovaries as little [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4949.36s)]
*  more than a resource. All things mundial, literally of the world. Worldliness, the flesh, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4955.84s)]
*  and the devil are the opponents that we must be aware of, John. You're right. And it is the [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4963.6s)]
*  tediousness, I suppose, that we must oppose through his glory and perhaps through these shirts and [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4969.120000000001s)]
*  those little booties. The shirts are an act of defiance. So I am struck, you put it so nicely, [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4976.64s)]
*  the sticky screens will keep me up at night thinking about what exactly that is. I hope not. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4990.64s)]
*  I'm praying for you. I'm praying for all of us. That was a joke. I just did a joke. Sorry. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=4997.52s)]
*  But I was taught to believe that when totalitarian government came, people would be [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5002.08s)]
*  marching through my town and I'd have to salute them. I didn't realize it would be like a [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5008.96s)]
*  heavyset middle-aged woman kind of scolding me about health. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5014.72s)]
*  We read a bit of George Orwell before, Tucker and I, and of course if you think of the ongoing [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5020.72s)]
*  portrayal of Trump as a kind of throwback, as they continually say that he is a dystopic dictator and [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5026.56s)]
*  that he'll make himself president for life. But indeed it is more these anodyne bureaucracies that [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5033.6s)]
*  are vividly portrayed in the Czech writer Franz Kafka's work who talks about unknowable bureaucratic [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5039.68s)]
*  entities that can accuse you of stuff and you never know quite where it's coming from. Or Aldous [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5048.08s)]
*  Huxley who writes not about dystopias in fact but utopias where everything is one. Because the key [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5052.64s)]
*  thing is of course the replacement of God. Once you've extracted God then they are God. Once you [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5059.280000000001s)]
*  have denied people access to the divine then you are free to replace God in their lives. You are [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5066.24s)]
*  free to issue new creeds. You are free to issue new dictums. And I thought it was very beautiful [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5072.48s)]
*  in that bit of Orwell from 1984 that we were reading, me and Tucker before, we were having a [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5079.36s)]
*  chat back there. But when it says that famous bit from George Orwell, when he talks about the [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5084.0s)]
*  dystopia that's being created and he says if you want to have an image you'll know this line because [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5089.2s)]
*  you're a well-educated beautiful people of Fort Lauderdale. If you want to imagine the future [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5093.04s)]
*  of humanity says the leader or a mouthpiece of the dictatorship depicted in 1984. He says [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5099.5199999999995s)]
*  imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever. Now that's not like the the jackboot of the [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5106.48s)]
*  very real Nazis. It's the identity of the human face. In whose image were you made? [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5114.16s)]
*  In whose image were you made? If you can stamp out and grind out the God from man then you are [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5120.56s)]
*  free to replace them. And what could be more diabolical, more Luciferian, more evil than that? [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5127.52s)]
*  Can I ask how many people in your orbit, friends of yours, people you talk to every day, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5138.0s)]
*  understand what you've just said? No, no, I don't mean understand the words you've said but [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5144.8s)]
*  understand the terms. That maybe we're not just looking at like a presidential election or [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5151.12s)]
*  referendums against the EU or debates over climate change or war or whatever but that this is all [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5157.12s)]
*  part of something much larger, a reorganization of the world into what you just described. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5163.44s)]
*  Revivalism has happened before hasn't it? There's been revivalism in my country, there's been [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5169.44s)]
*  revivalism here famously and even in the 60s and 70s someone was telling me today there was a revival [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5173.28s)]
*  of Christianity. I think it's difficult for, I don't know if it's difficult for people to understand, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5180.5599999999995s)]
*  we used to think that the counterculture was going to provide rebellion, radicalism, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5186.16s)]
*  anti-establishment, aerialism. That's in fact the place where you and I met was, I mean not literally [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5191.2s)]
*  but I mean sort of spiritually as it were, was you don't trust the establishment, I don't trust the [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5197.28s)]
*  establishment. I mean people saying oh when did Russell get red-peeled and when you know Russell [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5202.56s)]
*  you are a republican type stuff because I believe in individual freedom, I believe that the government [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5206.160000000001s)]
*  shouldn't get involved, I think like you want to just leave people to hell alone but like but what [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5210.8s)]
*  the difference is or the distinction is I suppose that you know like I've adored countercultural [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5215.92s)]
*  figures that have come out of your country, civil rights leaders, these are like magnificent people [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5221.52s)]
*  often curiously enough deeply religious people that are willing to sacrifice their lives for [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5226.96s)]
*  a higher good. I think it's hard for people in my circle as you ask to equate Christianity which [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5233.12s)]
*  has somehow been through slander, through hyperbole, through blasphemy reduced to something I don't know [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5240.64s)]
*  quite what it's been reduced to, banalised, criticised, blasphemed against. I don't think people [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5248.4800000000005s)]
*  recognise that within it is the key, the door, the path, the light, the bread, the vine, the salvation [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5254.4800000000005s)]
*  that we require is all embedded there. You can't sort of solve it within this paradigm, you can't [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5264.56s)]
*  solve it with this versus that, you can't solve it with rationalistic and materialistic means. I'm [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5270.96s)]
*  not surprised that they still look to the counterculture, that they still look to, no disrespect, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5276.64s)]
*  men with guitars because maybe you are the man with the guitar to do it John, like that they still [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5281.84s)]
*  thinking that the culture is somehow going to generate some solution but for me it's not that, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5286.56s)]
*  it's so but I can hardly condemn people for not recognising that the solution is to be found in [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5292.08s)]
*  Jesus Christ our saviour because you know six months ago I'd not been baptised, six months ago [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5298.0s)]
*  I didn't know that I was chosen, six months ago I didn't understand my heritage, six months ago I [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5303.92s)]
*  didn't understand the simplicity of this and my prayer is, my literal prayer in this moment [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5308.48s)]
*  is that people will join this awakening, people will join this awakening and for that to happen [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5313.919999999999s)]
*  I think we have to be so open-hearted with love, it has to be clear, so absolutely clear that this [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5318.799999999999s)]
*  does not run on hatred, that this does not run on condemnation, exclusivity or racism or damning or [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5324.719999999999s)]
*  tribalism, we have to recognise what he taught us, we have to recognise and live his final words, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5332.56s)]
*  love God with all your heart and love one another, love one another, it isn't easy to love one another [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5339.6s)]
*  is it sometimes, is it John? I love your point about the counterculture, I'm really, why did [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5345.68s)]
*  he look at me when I even said that? Because you have been all fierce, all the time I'm saying [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5355.52s)]
*  not Christian enough. I never said that by the way Russell. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5360.64s)]
*  Well I'll say the counterculture is not counterculture enough for me and I've noticed [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5367.12s)]
*  that all the counterculture figures, no offence the guys who wear black shirts in general [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5371.68s)]
*  and are telling you how radical they are and dye their hair blue, they all seem like bodyguards [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5376.72s)]
*  for Black Rock to me and they all seem to be on the side of the defense contractors and Dick Cheney [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5380.72s)]
*  just endorsed Kamala Harris and she likes it and no I'm serious and they all seem, I mean for all [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5386.8s)]
*  the radicals running, I'm so radical, I'm a trans person, really? Why does no one mention that they're [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5393.68s)]
*  loaning money at 30% interest in like half the countries enslaved by the credit card companies, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5399.52s)]
*  no one ever, you're not allowed to say that and when Donald Trump said that the other day, [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5403.4400000000005s)]
*  which you're absolutely not allowed to say, he's like well maybe we should just, I don't know, cap [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5408.0s)]
*  the interest at 10% at some point because we used to put members of the Genovese family in prison [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5411.12s)]
*  for loan sharking at the rates of the credit card companies are charging but you're not allowed to [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5416.24s)]
*  say that because you're like a socialist or something, that's sick and I guess I even feel [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5420.88s)]
*  guilty just having grown up in a world where like to criticize a credit card company was like blasphemy [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5427.12s)]
*  but I guess if you were thinking about what's best for people or flipping around what's really bad [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5432.5599999999995s)]
*  for them, being deeply in debt to a bank is not freedom, it's slavery and people who are getting [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5437.28s)]
*  rich from slavery are bad people and I don't know why you can't say that and when Trump said that [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5444.24s)]
*  and maybe who knows, I'm sure AEI and all the other supposedly conservative think tanks in D.C. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5449.12s)]
*  are like frantically issuing white papers paid for by the credit card companies to tell you that [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5454.88s)]
*  he's actually Hugo Chavez for noticing but it's still true, it's still true and if you were [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5459.2s)]
*  actually counter culture and in a world where the culture is really dark and anti-human, you should [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5466.0s)]
*  be, then you'd be saying stuff like that, you wouldn't be flacking for Black Rock and Boeing [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5470.64s)]
*  and you wouldn't be psyched when Dick Cheney endorses your pathetic status campaign [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5475.4400000000005s)]
*  and so like I don't know, I'm hoping for a revival of a counter culture a little bit. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5480.0s)]
*  Conservatives are the only real outlaws still left in the United States of America, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5488.240000000001s)]
*  we're the real outlaws. Sorry and by the way I'm not a socialist, [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5494.400000000001s)]
*  I'm a liberal. 30% on a credit card? Why is that not embarrassing? If I lit a [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5500.88s)]
*  marble in a restaurant I'd be arrested but if you get rich charging 30% on a credit card to [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5508.08s)]
*  poor people everyone's like oh that's so great, it's not great, it's disgusting and you should be [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5514.160000000001s)]
*  ashamed. I've got a lot of friends that are Democrats in the entertainment industry that are [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5518.400000000001s)]
*  big time liberal guys, I mean Bernie Sanders liberal that are friends of mine, comedians I know, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5527.12s)]
*  I know you know a lot of them, singers, songwriters, people like that and they see how [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5533.04s)]
*  bad things are getting in the country and they'll call me up on the phone, sometimes even come over [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5538.88s)]
*  to the house and want to sit down and talk to me. They're so upset about what they see going on but [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5543.04s)]
*  they just can't get themselves to think about voting for Donald Trump and so they asked me [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5548.8s)]
*  how do I get over this man because I just don't like the guy, I just don't like him and so my [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5557.68s)]
*  answer has been this and I think this is an important thing for people to hear because [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5563.280000000001s)]
*  I'm sure everybody in here has family members that have that feeling and neighbors and friends and [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5566.88s)]
*  maybe even kids right? We all know a bunch of them so here was my answer to them. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5573.12s)]
*  The system is evil and the system is trying to murder Donald Trump so who does that make [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5580.639999999999s)]
*  Donald Trump? That makes him the enemy of the wicked so it doesn't matter if you like everything [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5592.08s)]
*  about him, they hate him and they're wicked so that should be enough for you to understand [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5599.84s)]
*  he's your guy. It's a logical thing to come to a conclusion I believe. That's how I've been [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5607.2s)]
*  talking to people. What do they say? It's pretty simple right? Well they say well that's a good [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5613.5199999999995s)]
*  point. I go no that is the point. I said Dick Cheney is a bad guy, Kamala's a bad girl, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5619.28s)]
*  lots of bad people all getting together from both sides of the aisle to try to take this guy out. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5627.2s)]
*  That means he is not part of them by default. He is not part of what they are for. I think it's a [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5634.8s)]
*  simple argument. I mean Russell obviously, Russell dude you talk like a thesaurus man. I mean I wish [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5641.84s)]
*  I could record it. I always learn new words when I hang out with Russell. You know eighth grade, [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5647.28s)]
*  eighth grade was a long four years for me I'll be honest but you know I write simple country songs [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5653.2s)]
*  but I think that simple answers and logical conclusions will unravel the complexities of [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5659.6s)]
*  these people's minds when they are just tore up. They know things are going wrong and they don't [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5666.88s)]
*  like Trump. What do we do about it? I go listen the system is evil. The system is trying to murder [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5671.76s)]
*  him. What does that tell you about him? He's the enemy of evil in our country right now. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5678.240000000001s)]
*  Can I say one thing about just about Trump? If Trump did no other thing throughout his life [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5683.12s)]
*  but drive Dick Cheney to the Kamala Harris campaign that would be enough and I just want [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5692.0s)]
*  to apologize. I want to admit that I spent years defending Dick Cheney that I was wrong [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5698.0s)]
*  and that a lot of people I like and respect defended Dick Cheney. It's not even about Dick [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5705.52s)]
*  Cheney the man it's about the worship of violence for profit which is totally immoral. It's totally [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5709.76s)]
*  wrong and a lot of us were cowed into pretending it wasn't wrong. It is wrong and we're not allowed [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5714.88s)]
*  to kill people except in self-defense. That's true. That's always true. We can argue about what [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhqSdfw-enc&t=5720.0s)]
