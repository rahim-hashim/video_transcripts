# Advice to Men: Reject Sex, Parties, and Fame. Embrace God Instead.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM)
*  About 20 years ago a recent law school graduate called Tucker Mack started posting his experiences [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=0.0s)]
*  The details of his dating life on the internet. He became a sensation [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=7.28s)]
*  He wrote a bunch of best-selling books sold millions of copies the most famous of which was called [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  I hope they serve beer in hell [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  Not everyone likes Tucker Max a lot of people hated Tucker Max, but nobody could deny that he was smart [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=19.62s)]
*  He was a beautiful prose stylist not something you normally find in people writing about hooking up with ladies and getting loaded [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=25.44s)]
*  but he was and then he retired around 2012 he stopped writing about that stuff and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=31.76s)]
*  Received from public view and then a few years ago [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  He reemerged as a very different person as someone whose entire life was devoted to his own family at a level [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=39.64s)]
*  Most people can't relate to he became a homesteader [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=47.64s)]
*  What an interesting progression we thought it'd be worth [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=51.48s)]
*  Spending some time hearing how that happened and what it's like to truly prepare [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=54.68s)]
*  For the bad times on behalf of your family Tucker Max joins us in studio now Tucker Max. Thank you so much [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  Thanks for having me. It's great to meet you. Yes, you too [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=63.96s)]
*  So I just have to add most I want to hear about what you're doing now [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=66.24s)]
*  But I just have to ask how did you wind up you went to University of Chicago undergrad? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=69.34s)]
*  Famously the least fun school in America. It's earned its reputation [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=74.16s)]
*  It's just for this reputation and then you went to Duke Law School, which is a douche factory obviously [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=77.56s)]
*  No, it is I can't argue but then you wrote these accounts of your life [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  Which sounded like you were in a fraternity at Alabama. Yeah, like how did this happen? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=87.68s)]
*  Well, it's the benefit of going to the least fun undergrad [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  Is I didn't have any of my experiences in college when I was too young to appreciate how fun they were and I kind of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=96.4s)]
*  Started having them in law school when you know, cuz I got to law school [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=102.68s)]
*  I graduated three years from Chicago and the cool part about Chicago is I got to law school and I basically already [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=106.22000000000001s)]
*  Learned the other hard parts of law school [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=112.14s)]
*  So I was like, well, this is easy. I don't need to go to class [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=114.94000000000001s)]
*  Like I know all of this [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=117.18s)]
*  I know how to think all this stuff law school is supposed to teach you already learned and then I had all my friends were [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  Dudes who went to state schools [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=123.9s)]
*  They were the smart kids at state schools like Kansas or Pitt or you [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=125.42000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and so it was like and they knew how to party and I'm like [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=128.58s)]
*  Oh, I didn't have anyone like you guys with me in undergrad [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=131.58s)]
*  Let's go do this more and then of course we were by UNC which was all girls [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=134.42s)]
*  It's not literally an all-girls school, but it might as well be well, it is like 65% [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=138.9s)]
*  No dudes at UNC. Well, the dudes are just like the FOP the the iconic stereotype of the FOP ish southern frat boy types [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=143.62s)]
*  Yeah, and so for me it was like hunting at a petting zoo [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=151.34s)]
*  It was so easy and we'd go over there and be beautiful girls and these douchebag idiot guys and it was like [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=155.14s)]
*  Oh, this is great. And so we had a great time [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=160.96s)]
*  and then we all left law school went to different cities and [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=164.42s)]
*  I went to Florida and I hated it like this is [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=169.14s)]
*  To work in a firm. No, I got fired from a big law firm called Femmick and West in Silicon Valley [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  I got fired about three weeks into being a summer associate actually not even a full-time employee [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=179.22s)]
*  And so I was essentially blacklisted [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=184.18s)]
*  It's impossible to get fired and I did it I did in three weeks [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=188.42s)]
*  Basically, I was an unguided missile man. I was drunk at all the firm events [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=192.36s)]
*  I did all that stuff that actually wasn't the problem the thing I did that caused them to fire me and honestly [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=197.52s)]
*  I'm not even mad at them [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=203.34s)]
*  They did what I would have done if I would have been a partner there one of the senior female partners [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  propositioned me, you know like [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=210.68s)]
*  Wanted to hook up with me. She was married not that that meant anything to me at the time [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  Or to female lawyers by well not to her I don't know I'm not gonna say all generalize [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=218.4s)]
*  I'll handle the generalization here to her. It didn't obviously mean anything and for some reason I turned her down and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=223.8s)]
*  Then told everyone about it [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=231.28s)]
*  Which is like if I had slept with her I'd have been bulletproof and if I just shut up [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=233.08s)]
*  No one would have cared but um, I kind of did the worst of all worlds and so [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=237.76s)]
*  You know, I was I was a liability. You can't have someone [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=243.0s)]
*  Would turn down a partner's advance and then tell others about it [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=248.36s)]
*  I mean that's I mean the Bar Association could get involved at that point. That is a violation of ethics and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=251.62s)]
*  Intelligence like what's wrong with you? Why are you so dumb? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=257.16s)]
*  There's a way to play this game and you're doing it totally wrong and I was and so I [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Then I okay. So even that wouldn't have blacklisted me from the legal profession, but I wrote two days before [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=265.28000000000003s)]
*  She propositioned me or before they fired me [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=272.56s)]
*  I had gotten drunk at a firm event and caused kind of a scene although it was kind of funny [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=275.44s)]
*  And so I wrote an email about it. That was pretty funny. I sent it to my friends. What was the scene? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=279.84s)]
*  we had like a charity auction and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=285.08s)]
*  I got up and I took the mic from like the auctioneer and I was yelling at this girl because she was bidding against me [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=287.56s)]
*  And the price was high. I'm like stop bidding [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=294.88s)]
*  I can't afford this and I need this to stay at the firm and like it was like kind of like a funny like [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=296.36s)]
*  It was like, you know, you're like the funny drunken person at a corporate event [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=302.16s)]
*  Like I really didn't go too far [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=305.24s)]
*  But I went right up to that as a summer associate the wine is lower for you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  exactly like they even the managing partner thought it was hilarious and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=310.44s)]
*  So and I wrote an email about that not about the female partner sent that to my friends [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=314.28000000000003s)]
*  Like on a Tuesday and then like on Wednesday, I was fired. They didn't wait to Friday [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=320.36s)]
*  On a Wednesday right and so of course my friends are assholes and so they sent that to all their friends and then it like [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=326.15999999999997s)]
*  Went out from there and so that like everyone in the legal profession got that email that summer [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=333.56s)]
*  Like I was the you know, they you know, there's always legends about yeah [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=338.52s)]
*  I was one of the legends that ended up turning it in and was your plan at that point to spend your life in big law [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=342.08s)]
*  Yeah, it was it really was I hate to say it the God's honest truth is I was the worst kind of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  Like okay, so I was deciding out of undergrad whether to go to iBanking [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=355.44s)]
*  Management consulting or law like and I was that type of dude. I had that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  soul death [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=365.2s)]
*  No, I I was seeking status without merit, which is what everyone in those professions is doing [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=366.0s)]
*  right and that's just the and I you could not have convinced me that it was not a [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  Viable or valuable path for my soul to go make a bunch of money [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=378.56s)]
*  For bullshit, which is what you do in those professions and and I bought it I bought the whole thing hook line and sinker and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=383.59999999999997s)]
*  So I was going after that [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=391.56s)]
*  But I think there was obviously a part of me like the whatever you want to call it the drunk at the work event part [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=393.0s)]
*  Who clearly did not want that there was a part of me, you know, like like some people, you know [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=398.64s)]
*  Like you'll be mass murderers who want to get caught of course [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, I was I wanted to get I didn't have the truth [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=406.76s)]
*  I'd love to make myself out to be a hero [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=410.92s)]
*  But the true story is I didn't have the courage to realize that it was a horrible soulless path that I didn't want to go [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=412.71999999999997s)]
*  To so I acted out until they fired me and kicked me out of the profession [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=419.2s)]
*  So when that email went throughout the tiny and very inward-looking legal world [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=422.84s)]
*  What kind of response did you get? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=429.76s)]
*  They almost didn't let me back come back for my senior year or my third year at Duke [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=432.92s)]
*  No, yeah, like that [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=437.71999999999997s)]
*  The it got back to Duke Oh [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=439.8s)]
*  Everyone like I if I had wanted to stay in the legal profession [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  I would have had to be like a public defender like there was no I'm serious. No [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=446.68s)]
*  One was gonna that low a divorce attorney maybe Jack. I might have been a little jack [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=451.8s)]
*  That would have been it. I'm like David French [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=457.40000000000003s)]
*  hilarious, um [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=460.64000000000004s)]
*  Sorry, that's so I love legal jokes. So Duke was mad [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=462.64000000000004s)]
*  So at this point you realize like I the only reason she let me come back and finish my third year [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=467.44s)]
*  I'm not really sure because she generally just no no the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=473.64s)]
*  the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=477.4s)]
*  Do the head of the yeah, I forget what her [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=478.92s)]
*  Her exact title was but the the only reason she let me back was because I promised not to walk at graduation [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=483.44s)]
*  like I was gonna graduate and so it was like [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=491.36s)]
*  Like basically if I wasn't there which I didn't care about going to anyway because I knew I was gonna be a job in a legal [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=494.4s)]
*  Profession I just wanted to finish what for two reasons one is because I didn't want to quit and not have my degree [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=501.2s)]
*  right, which probably honestly would have been the best thing for me, but I [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=506.96s)]
*  Was one of those right like now. I want to actually have the guy [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=510.92s)]
*  I don't want to say I went to Duke Law School when I have the JD which I do but then also [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=513.56s)]
*  I had such it was like my party years like everyone else's party years are an undergrad mine were in law [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=518.16s)]
*  Had you been in a fraternity in college? No, no, it's pretty funny [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=524.5s)]
*  Yeah [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=528.52s)]
*  I know you invented this genre of fraternity literature the New York Times that I invented frat tire and I wasn't in a frat and I [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=528.92s)]
*  Didn't write satire that it's memoir I wrote but that's the New York Times, right? Like they're gonna they know about genres [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=535.16s)]
*  Anyway, they're gonna get literally everything wrong. Of course they are [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=540.88s)]
*  Yeah, so what did you decide to do with your life at this point? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=543.64s)]
*  You're kind of out of options. Yeah, it was [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=546.88s)]
*  it was not a good situation for me because [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=549.56s)]
*  Where I was was I had enough courage to get drunk and ruin a future [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=552.64s)]
*  I didn't want but not enough courage to recognize that that's what I was doing [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=558.4399999999999s)]
*  So I was in like this tough situation my dad owned some restaurants in Florida [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=562.28s)]
*  And so kind of the like I was still kind of looking for the easy path, right like law [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=567.28s)]
*  law, you know and [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=574.36s)]
*  I banking and management consulting even though you're working 100 something hour weeks. They really are the easy path [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=576.72s)]
*  They are the soulless easy coward path. Yes [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  and so the next coward path for me was the family business and [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=585.6800000000001s)]
*  I kind of I'd never really wanted to go into restaurants of the family business, but now I'm like well [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=592.08s)]
*  This is you know, the two things I've trained for I wasn't good at so I'm not allowed to anymore [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=598.6800000000001s)]
*  So I kind of went that path and then I got fired from the family business in like six months [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=605.12s)]
*  It took me six months instead of three weeks. How'd you get fired from the family business? Oh, that's a long story [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=611.08s)]
*  Basically, I was good at this now [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=616.44s)]
*  I was good because restaurant business right and I'm smart now going and and if you're smart now going the restaurant business is designed [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=618.86s)]
*  For people who are who don't fit anywhere else but are kind of smart and capable and so I was good at it [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=625.36s)]
*  the problem was I [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=631.64s)]
*  Assumed that my dad wanted to run a good business [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=634.28s)]
*  I didn't realize the business existed for my dad's ego and so I got in and realized oh [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=638.16s)]
*  There's all kinds of people here who suck who are stealing from him who we there's all these things [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=643.76s)]
*  We could be doing better. I mean really basic stuff. Like why are we ordering from this company? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=649.24s)]
*  They're charging twice as much as this company [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=653.84s)]
*  It turns out that companies give my dad kickbacks and then these people who are incompetent stealing from him [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=656.64s)]
*  You know feed my dad's ego in a way that he values way more than what they're stealing [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=662.9200000000001s)]
*  and so I essentially but like a fool just like I [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=667.84s)]
*  Didn't sleep with a partner and told everyone I went in recognize these people were clowns and was like, oh well [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=671.9200000000001s)]
*  This is my dad and my name's on the door [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  so clearly the fact that I'm right is more than enough I like I told them that they sucked and that I was gonna get [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=679.88s)]
*  them fired and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=686.08s)]
*  You know, they were smart enough and knew my dad well enough they rallied kind of the troops and got enough evidence [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=688.1600000000001s)]
*  against me that that [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=693.2800000000001s)]
*  My dad picked them over me and I got fired amazing [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=695.0s)]
*  So now you're a graduate of two of the most prestigious schools in the country, but you're unemployed you've washed out of an unemployable [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=699.2800000000001s)]
*  So what do you do? Man? I was not in a good spot [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=706.2800000000001s)]
*  It was it was a hard time for me and I was basically like [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  You know [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=715.88s)]
*  Bartending, you know work like the kind of jobs that losers in their 20s get that was me [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=717.12s)]
*  Like I was a loser in my 20s early 20s [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=722.2800000000001s)]
*  And then I was at the same time I was writing emails on my friends from law school about all you know [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=725.08s)]
*  I was living in South Florida, which is a soulless horrible place because I don't do drugs and I'm not old [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=729.8000000000001s)]
*  So there was no social niche for me in South Florida, right? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  Because if you do coke and you go to clubs, right? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=738.7600000000001s)]
*  It's great and if you're like 70 and you know play golf in the Boca Country Club, then it's great [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=741.24s)]
*  But there's nothing else and so I hated my life [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=747.1600000000001s)]
*  but you know, I get drunk and hook up with girls anyway and [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=750.32s)]
*  Getting these horrible situations and write emails about it and send them my friends and one of my friends [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=753.4000000000001s)]
*  A guy a great you actually might even do you know Sean trendy real clear politics? Yeah [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=758.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay, so Sean went to law school with me and is a good friend of mine [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=762.9200000000001s)]
*  He's a great dude and he actually called me up and he was getting the emails [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=766.84s)]
*  And he's like dude listen [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=770.72s)]
*  You're not good at law. You're not good at business clearly, but these emails are the funniest things I've ever read [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=772.8000000000001s)]
*  You need to go be a writer and I was like what the fuck? What kind of bitch shit is this? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=777.84s)]
*  What are you talking about Sean? This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard and he's like well, dude look at [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=782.5600000000001s)]
*  Evidence right and so what a wise piece of advice [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=789.5600000000001s)]
*  Was Sean that gave it to me. I'm a writer because of Sean trendy truly. He's yes [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=794.2800000000001s)]
*  It is a hundred percent true and so or I took that path because of Sean I was already writing [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=799.64s)]
*  I just wasn't envisioning that as a profession for me. You're doing that and so I [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=804.24s)]
*  I ended up putting my stuff on the first actually no [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=810.6s)]
*  I took like the five emails that my friends thought were the funniest [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  I sent them to every publisher and every book agent in New York [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=817.12s)]
*  Because at the time publishing was still on New York and there was actually literally this was 2000 [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=820.96s)]
*  2001 2002 there's a physical book of [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=826.0s)]
*  Like all the agents addresses and all like their query stuff because you'll have to remember this. Yeah, very well [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=829.68s)]
*  I probably sent a thousand query letters [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=834.92s)]
*  Maybe five between five hundred thousand. I've got zero positive literally zero positive response [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=837.96s)]
*  You know like 90% nothing right and then probably got like 50 form letter rejections [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=843.16s)]
*  And I even got like I still have a couple of them [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=848.24s)]
*  Like some a couple personalized rejections were like the editor was like this is the worst thing I've ever read [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=851.16s)]
*  You should never write even an email again [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=856.48s)]
*  like [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=859.2600000000001s)]
*  You have no place in publishing [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=860.5400000000001s)]
*  But at the same time I was sending my emails like all the emails [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=862.7s)]
*  I'd forwarded to my friends would get like they would forward those [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=866.34s)]
*  Like not just the ones that got me fired [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=869.9000000000001s)]
*  But the funny ones after and I was getting my emails forwarded back to me remember early in internet email chains [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=871.94s)]
*  Yeah, okay [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=877.62s)]
*  So I was getting my own emails forwarded back to me from people in other social circles who didn't know I had written them [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=878.38s)]
*  Be like dude, you should read this. This is so funny and I'm like, alright, so clearly I'm good at this [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=883.82s)]
*  Like Sean was right. These are funny [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=888.06s)]
*  To people who weren't friends. I'm like, alright [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=891.02s)]
*  I mean it is arrogant to think this but all these people in publishing are wrong now now [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=893.6999999999999s)]
*  I've now I know publishing I'm like, of course they're all wrong [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=897.78s)]
*  They're all idiots like pretty much everyone in publishing is there because they're a failed a failed writer [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=899.9399999999999s)]
*  It's not literally everyone but almost I didn't know that at the time, but I was like, alright [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=904.7399999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm not good. They're not gonna publish me [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=909.54s)]
*  But then the internet was a thing at the time [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=912.14s)]
*  This is 2002 and so I had to learn to program HTML [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=914.54s)]
*  I put up a site on GeoCities if you remember GeoCities [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=918.0s)]
*  and [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=921.2s)]
*  it's like I got featured on like college humor and a few other like those humor blogs that were really really early and it blew up and [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=922.42s)]
*  MTV came and did a documentary about people who were dating on because back when like dating on there and it was weird and creepy [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=930.58s)]
*  you know and so [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=936.18s)]
*  they did a documentary about me and that blew up and then all the publishing companies came back and they were like [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=937.94s)]
*  We want to do your write your books and then that became I hope they serve beer and hell [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=944.14s)]
*  How many books did you write? How many did you sell? I wrote four fratire books [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=949.0600000000001s)]
*  One I kind of I gave away for free so it doesn't have but three like were published all three were, you know [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=954.3s)]
*  New York Times bestsellers, I think I've sold about four and a half ish million of those books. Yeah, that's incredible [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=960.12s)]
*  It was all I mean, especially because my audience were essentially [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=966.94s)]
*  People who don't read I [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=971.0799999999999s)]
*  Can't tell you how many dudes in my life [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=973.0s)]
*  It's been tens of thousands have told me I've never finished a book read a book or bought a book other than yours [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=975.0799999999999s)]
*  You know, I believe that like tens of that [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=982.76s)]
*  So when why'd you why'd you stop and when did you stop because my books were my stories about? [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=985.16s)]
*  Doing all the dumb stuff guys and a lot of women also do in their 20s drinking hooking up [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=990.88s)]
*  Partying all that stuff and then by the time, you know, I wrote I started writing at [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=996.28s)]
*  27 by the time I got to about 33 34. I was like pretty tired of it, you know, like [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1002.64s)]
*  drinking and partying and you know going out five nights a week is super fun when you're at a certain stage in life and I [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1009.88s)]
*  Was way past that stage of life and it was becoming tedious and tiresome and that the cost of that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1016.0799999999999s)]
*  Lifestyle was really not just the physical cost but the emotional cost was catching up to me and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1022.7199999999999s)]
*  Honestly, man, like like everyone who goes some people go through that phase for a week and some do it for a decade [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1029.6s)]
*  I was more towards the decade side of it, but it was um, I was feeling stuck man [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1034.44s)]
*  Like you can't move on at life if you have to be this person that is doing a thing at a certain phase [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1039.9199999999998s)]
*  Right and that's oh dude. It was so depressing because all my fans would come to me [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1046.8s)]
*  You know, I do public events all the time speeches whatever and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1051.96s)]
*  They were all really upset if I wasn't the Tucker max they envisioned in their head [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1055.58s)]
*  And at the time I would get really mad at them like fuck you. I'm a whole person I [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1060.72s)]
*  But that was my own immaturity like they liked me because of my stories and because of a certain [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1066.2s)]
*  Attitude I had a certain way I was in a certain part of my life and some of them realized oh [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1072.84s)]
*  That's just part of his Jagger has to sing satisfaction at every show [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1077.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I wasn't gonna sing satisfaction the rest of my life like I [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1081.8799999999999s)]
*  eventually as I [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1086.48s)]
*  Matured a little I'm like look. Why am I doing getting mad at them? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1088.6399999999999s)]

*  They read the books out there were funny didn't expect me to be but that was 20% [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1096.94s)]
*  Right most people like they would come up and you know [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  They have this multi-year relationship with me that has nothing to do with me, right? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1103.52s)]
*  Totally unilateral and it's all about a projection in their mind of who I am based only on the books and that was [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1107.4s)]
*  It got really tiring after a while and then instead of trying to fight it and getting mad at them [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1115.96s)]
*  I'm like, alright. Well, I just need to move on with my life. And so I wrote [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1121.5s)]

*  I [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1133.0s)]
*  Like I've done with this part of my life and then that kind of did set me free [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1134.24s)]
*  although most people who know me know me from that stuff and so even that bro [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1138.24s)]
*  For years afterwards like I would be at Whole Foods and a kid with like a younger kid or something would come up to me [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1144.48s)]
*  Be like, oh, it's your Tucker max and I like why aren't you, you know drunk screaming curses at people laying under a table? [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1150.32s)]

*  Hooking up with various women, right? I told the truth about things. Most people don't ever tell the truth. Yes, so [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1182.48s)]
*  Like what did that teach you about what you wanted in a wife? [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1188.4s)]
*  I [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, it definitely showed me very much what I don't want yeah [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1196.0s)]
*  because a lot of the I mean I [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1200.1200000000001s)]
*  Was with a lot of women in that period I was single I was into women [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1202.32s)]
*  I wrote about it and then women who were at that stage, you know [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1205.92s)]
*  The same stage as me came to me and so there were a lot [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1210.26s)]
*  and I realized I [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1214.0s)]
*  Mean there's so much the big thing man was I realized [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  I needed a woman who was very smart who was very sweet and empathic but most importantly, I need a woman who [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1223.04s)]
*  Really had her own thing in life who really thought for herself who really was her own person, right? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1231.3600000000001s)]
*  because I [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1237.8s)]
*  Three or four years before I started I I retired [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1238.96s)]
*  I would have been really happy with the hottest girl there was who was pretty sweet and and basically [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1242.28s)]
*  A trophy wife. Yeah, right. I would have been totally cool with that [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1249.0s)]
*  And then by the time I got to be about 32 33 34. I realized oh, thank god [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1253.32s)]
*  I didn't get married. I would have been so miserable with that. I would have hated that [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1258.96s)]
*  I would have been divorced within five six years [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1263.44s)]
*  I realized I needed a partner and then I started to understand what a partner actually would look like for me [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1265.76s)]
*  At that point, that's the crazy thing man [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1272.8799999999999s)]
*  I think I had to go through whatever hundreds or thousands of women to realize how lonely I was and how lonely that life is [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1275.8400000000001s)]
*  After a while, you know, it's that metaphor I always use is imagine that like because dudes don't get this man [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1283.7600000000002s)]
*  They don't understand women do most women understand what I mean when I talk about this [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1289.8400000000001s)]
*  because most guys [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1294.64s)]
*  Have to go their whole life [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1297.3600000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter how good-looking you are how smart or how rich you are [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1298.7600000000002s)]
*  You have to work for women you have to have game you have to talk to them [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1302.1599999999999s)]
*  You have to be good in some way at least connecting with with a woman [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  But once you get famous all that's out the window [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1310.6399999999999s)]
*  Like you don't have to really do anything but other than be famous and there's a million examples of this of dudes who have no [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1313.96s)]
*  business being with any women who are famous who get all kinds of [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1319.76s)]
*  Women and you can't understand what that's like as a dude [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1324.28s)]
*  Because you've spent your whole life like imagine living on a like a desert island and you're scraping out in existence and you have food [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1328.48s)]
*  But never enough and then all of a sudden you get picked up off of that desert island and you get moved into a Chinese buffet [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1335.08s)]
*  And you live at the Chinese buffet [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1341.2s)]
*  You're gonna gorge yourself for a while or the best Vegas buffet you can ever yeah golden Corral forever [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1344.24s)]
*  You're gonna gorge yourself for a while [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1349.08s)]
*  in fact [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1351.08s)]
*  You're gonna gorge yourself into you throw up a few times and then you're gonna keep gorging yourself and that was what my life [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1351.48s)]
*  Was like I would like because women are always a scarcity for you as a dude [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1356.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter how rich or you are or how good-looking you are how smart you are [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1360.94s)]
*  There's still a scarcity until you become famous and then there then there an abundance but for women [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1365.2s)]
*  Penises and abundance from the time that they probably pre puberty for a lot of them right like there's always dudes around [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1370.6000000000001s)]
*  You know like and so women can kind of understand that it was I didn't understand that at all [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1377.96s)]
*  And then I kind of had to revel [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1383.0800000000002s)]
*  In that abundance for a while and and wallow in it until it became like all abundance becomes sickening [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1386.0800000000002s)]
*  And yes, the kind of like all abundance. That's right, right and you've got a really an okay. I don't want everything there are [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1392.72s)]
*  Here's the things out. Here's what's healthy. Here's what I want. Let me figure out what that is [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1399.44s)]
*  So in a lot of ways the best it's funny people lately will say like your intro is really good [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1403.64s)]
*  Like it seems like a hundred eighty degree turnaround in my from where I said having lived it [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1409.24s)]
*  I couldn't have gotten to be a dedicated father and husband and homesteader if I hadn't gone through that phase of [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1413.88s)]
*  unbridled [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1422.1200000000001s)]
*  Abundance and hedonism. I needed that it's just interesting that you had all the women you wanted [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1424.24s)]
*  But you just wanted one in the eventually. Yes, I don't get me wrong [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1429.5200000000002s)]
*  If my wife was cool with two or three, I might be alright with that too. Like yeah, but but no no it was [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1433.44s)]
*  lots and lots of different women was [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1439.96s)]
*  Not an effective way to fill the hole of loneliness. Yes, that's right for a while [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1442.96s)]
*  I thought it worked, but it doesn't work long. No, it doesn't work. Yeah, I mean abundance doesn't work [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1447.54s)]
*  You could not have convinced me of that with any words when I was 29, right? [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1452.76s)]
*  There's no it's an age thing. No, it's totally right. I've arrived the same conclusion [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1458.3200000000002s)]
*  But how did you get okay? So now you are not just a husband and a father, but that's basically your job [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1464.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I sold my company. It's all I do now [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1470.24s)]
*  but [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1473.16s)]
*  What motivated your desire to make that your life? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1474.8s)]
*  Like and what is homesteading and why do you do it? So it [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1479.16s)]
*  What I didn't come up with this goal ahead of time and then do it I [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1482.72s)]
*  I discovered this path as I walked it right so so after I retired from writing [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1486.48s)]
*  You know the stories of drinking hooking up or type of fratire [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1491.96s)]
*  What ended up happening is I was still a really well-known author and a lot of people came to me to help them write [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1495.34s)]
*  Their books so I started a company called scribe that we you know, David Goggins [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1500.74s)]
*  I'm sure we did his books and Tiffany Haddish and some other people like that and we did about [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1506.02s)]
*  From the time I started until when I left which was a [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1511.7s)]
*  2022 like 2000 books and so we were kind of the premier like independent ghostwriting publishing firm, right and [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1515.3s)]
*  a [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1524.26s)]
*  Built a great company 500 employees me and my co-founder Zach [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1525.86s)]
*  Built a great company and [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1531.22s)]
*  It was rewarding and I kind of went through the the entrepreneurial phase of life [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1533.6599999999999s)]
*  Before I thought I was on channel, but I was an artist and that are being an artist and running a business with employees are totally different [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1538.26s)]
*  Oh, I found out totally different things and I did not understand one of those things not the other [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1543.86s)]
*  So so it was there was a lot rewarding with it and it started the business I met my way first then started the business and [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1549.8999999999999s)]
*  as [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1558.78s)]
*  The business grew and developed and I saw a very clear path to a lot of money big valuations [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1561.02s)]
*  Expansion all this stuff. But at the same time, you know my relationship my wife and my kids and as my kids got older [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1567.66s)]
*  Even though my kids are still pretty young. I was like, hmm, and then I was in a lot of [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1574.42s)]
*  Social groups and masterminds with pretty advanced and successful entrepreneurs who had way bigger companies than me and who were older and had older kids [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1579.46s)]
*  and I saw kind of how miserable they were in a lot of ways and [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1587.78s)]
*  And like how much time they spent on their business how little they spent with their families and then I would like meet their kids [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1591.14s)]
*  And be like, hmm something's off that not all of them [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1596.9s)]
*  Some of them had great balance and some didn't and I just kind of realized man that as much as I did [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1599.86s)]
*  I like business and I like entrepreneurship I [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1604.94s)]
*  Didn't love it and I definitely didn't love it more than my wife for my kids and I realized like what I [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1608.9s)]
*  Don't know when I came to this realization [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1616.02s)]
*  but I came to the realization that um [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1618.7s)]
*  the only thing that matters in my life is the relationships with the people I love and the things I do that mattered in that and [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1621.54s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like having a company to make money is that's important. But above a certain level like what am I doing? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1627.78s)]
*  I'm just stealing from my children. I'm stealing my father from their children [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1633.66s)]
*  or I've seen my children's father from them, which is me and I [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1638.98s)]
*  Decided I wasn't gonna do that like that [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1644.82s)]
*  200 million or a billion dollars is not worth that 20 million isn't even worth it [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1648.26s)]
*  It's not worth it. But most people have this realization decided. Okay, we're gonna we're gonna spend a year and sail to New Zealand [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1651.94s)]
*  Right, but you decided to buy a homestead in Texas. Yes and grow your own food raise your own food [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1658.42s)]
*  Yeah, why? [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1665.74s)]
*  well [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1667.02s)]
*  There were a couple reasons so you were around 2020 and 2021. Yes, so I don't have to describe all that [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1668.42s)]
*  But um, well, how did it affect you? I mean you weren't working in politics, right? Yeah. No, no [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1674.98s)]
*  No, I wrote a piece on this on my blog about how I kind of I thought I was awake to how the world worked [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1679.0600000000002s)]
*  Cuz you know, I'd work in the entertainment business [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1684.26s)]
*  You have to you understand media entertainment and if you work in that business you see behind the curtain and how messed up everything is [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1685.78s)]
*  And I saw I mean I saw evil Hollywood was long before the me too stuff and I knew like everyone Hollywood knew the wine [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1693.18s)]
*  So wine scene was a rapist and like I knew I thought I understood [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1700.06s)]
*  But then 2020 happened and the lockdowns happened and all this and I was like, oh, it's way worse than I thought [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1704.3s)]
*  Like I saw a little bit behind the curtain. That was a public health emergency [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1710.46s)]
*  Of course it was right. Of course. And did you think that for a moment? Did you think any of this was just like what it is? [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1715.1399999999999s)]
*  So you grew up in this country. Tell us what you thought so [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1722.06s)]
*  When I was watching [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1727.26s)]
*  the videos of people dying in the street in China like early March of [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1729.62s)]
*  2020 there was a window of about for being honest about six weeks. I was probably fooled [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1735.46s)]
*  Three to six weeks. Yeah, right this scary this might be legit. This might be an actual [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1740.3s)]
*  Epidemic a pandemic this might be like whatever and so that I was [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1745.86s)]
*  You can actually look at my Twitter timeline. There's a when [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1751.46s)]
*  South I was canceled in 2020. I was for that. I was like, oh, yeah, that was like March 15th at 2020 [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1755.7s)]
*  I was totally for that but then by mid-april, I'm like, mmm, hold on like nothing about this seems right [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1760.78s)]
*  Yeah, and by May I'm like, oh well, this is fraud [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1766.44s)]
*  like this is clearly a fraud and then the riot started and it was like I mean the iconic photo of the [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1768.66s)]
*  The the the the CNN with the chiron, you know, mostly peaceful protest is fire in the background. So come on like I'm not [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1776.54s)]
*  But if you're I mean if you if you're writing for racial justice, you're not gonna spread a deadly virus, right? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1785.54s)]
*  Obviously, of course and well the my favorite were the people was like well racial justice is deadlier than or racial injustice is deadlier than COVID [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1791.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm like your racism is scarier than it's not right. Yeah, and that's what I was like, okay. Okay, so this is [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1799.3000000000002s)]
*  This is utter total bullshit. And so then my wife and I had always talked about getting on land [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1805.2s)]
*  We'd always wanted to hold on. Let me ask you to pause. What did you conclude from that? So it was obviously this was fraudulent [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1811.68s)]
*  This was a total fraud, but like why? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1817.56s)]
*  Well, see, I mean I went to [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1821.24s)]
*  The you know all the big schools like I knew I [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1824.12s)]
*  Woke wasn't a shock to me. I saw that coming for years [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1827.84s)]
*  And in fact, I can't I mean I had a company that was 70% women and all creative [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1831.16s)]
*  So you think we would have been affected early? No, I saw it coming [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1836.04s)]
*  I kept it out of scribe for as long as I was there. I was able to keep it out [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1839.28s)]
*  it's really it's actually if you want a [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1843.64s)]
*  Really easy trick to keep woke people away from your organization. There's a very simple way to do it. You just [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1846.76s)]
*  Emphasize make your primary [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1853.96s)]
*  value responsibility and your second accountability and those people will go elsewhere [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1856.08s)]
*  Is there a competent not necessarily some of them are smart and capable? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1861.0s)]
*  It's that the the woke mind virus is about put placing your responsive placing blame for your life on other people [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1865.56s)]
*  So if everything is about first about responsibility and accountability [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1874.04s)]
*  Those people will not come to your organization. And so I was able to kind of shelter my world from that. No, it works [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1877.8s)]
*  It works beautifully [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1884.6s)]
*  I was able to shelter my world from them pretty well [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1886.6s)]
*  And so once I saw all this I just at the time we're talking about summer 2020 [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1890.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, okay, the woke mind virus has clearly infected media and these people are fools [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1896.1599999999999s)]
*  I didn't realize how corrupt how truly [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1901.76s)]
*  Catastrophically corrupt government was until January 6th of 2021 [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1905.84s)]
*  That was when that was because you know, my wife and I decided to buy land [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1910.3999999999999s)]
*  The summer of 2020 and we bought our house in Tennessee that I showed you that we talked about right and so because at the time [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1915.6799999999998s)]
*  I like I didn't really understand I didn't think America was at the state [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1921.2399999999998s)]
*  It was yet and you know, the way I looked at preparation and emergency stuff was a bug out place, right? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1924.9199999999998s)]
*  And so we bought a beautiful house in the mountains isolated [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1931.2199999999998s)]
*  Because that that's where my level of consciousness and understanding was then January 21st happened and in real January 6th [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1935.08s)]
*  Sorry January 6th January 6th of 2021 and I in real time [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1942.88s)]
*  I you just watched the feeds and I saw I mean because it wasn't hidden the Capitol Police were letting people in and [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1946.92s)]
*  most of these people were just drunken buffoons and it was like [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1954.1200000000001s)]
*  obvious that this was nonsense that this was [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1958.64s)]
*  In no way shape or form anything approaching an interaction and then you would turn on cable news and in real time [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1962.24s)]
*  You'd see them form this narrative that's not just wrong but literally totally contrary [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1969.1999999999998s)]
*  To what's going on and I can see I don't know why that moment [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1975.32s)]
*  But at that moment I realized that the Republic had fallen [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1980.52s)]
*  I don't think it fell at that moment it had fallen probably decades maybe a century before [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1983.9599999999998s)]
*  But I did not truly internalize it until that moment when you watch them [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1989.36s)]
*  Tell you what you were seeing wasn't real and it was something totally else like not [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=1995.26s)]
*  Media is always wrong, but it just because they're wrong doesn't mean the opposite is true, right? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2002.06s)]
*  so you have to kind of look in the direction that they're wrong and in this case the narrative that they were pushing was [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2007.34s)]
*  very clearly the narrative you push if you want to if you want to create a [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2015.06s)]
*  Fascist communist whatever some form of the house hands a police state and and I don't all the evidence was there you know like [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2021.4199999999998s)]
*  It's pretty common for you [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2031.22s)]
*  You'll deny reality until all of a sudden the last piece of evidence clicks in and then all the other facts like oh shit [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2032.46s)]
*  I should I could have seen this a long time ago, and I waited it was like that for me [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2038.54s)]
*  I mean you can make a good argument that the the Republic fell [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2043.58s)]
*  In America you can make an argument it fell during the whiskey rebellion [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2048.54s)]
*  Yeah, right you can make an argument several times the 18th century definitely during the Civil War [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2053.7000000000003s)]
*  Lots of times in the 20th century like when they murdered the president yes [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2058.94s)]
*  JTFK I [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2065.1400000000003s)]
*  Don't know when the American Republic fell, but it became very clear on [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2067.38s)]
*  Deniably clear to me on January 6 2021 that we were not just an empire [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2071.98s)]
*  But we were the late stages of empire like I'd I'd essentially missed the American [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2076.9s)]
*  understanding the American Empire was an empire and [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2082.2999999999997s)]
*  As I go man [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2085.54s)]
*  And then once once I got that then I'm like oh now everything makes sense [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2087.54s)]
*  This is Empire collapse, and I understand Empire collapse pretty well like I [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2091.22s)]
*  Very like all dudes very interested in the Roman history and Mongolian history [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2095.46s)]
*  and if you study the the both the transition from Republic to Empire in [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2099.74s)]
*  Rome and the transition from Genghis Khan to his sons because they were never Republic [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2105.54s)]
*  But under Genghis Khan it was the Mongolian Empire was what we would consider a free place in a lot of ways [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2110.04s)]
*  Four of these Mongolians and the transition from that to his sons and grandsons [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2116.98s)]
*  What less free [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2121.86s)]
*  Very different yeah, yeah, it was Empire collapse [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2125.1s)]
*  And I'm like this is exactly what's going on and then once I got that that was when my wife and I got serious about [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2127.9s)]
*  Like okay, we need to actually get ready for what's coming because it's gonna be I don't know what's coming [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2134.2200000000003s)]
*  But it's the the baseline of what's coming is gonna be chaos, and we're gonna see a lot more of what we saw [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2141.38s)]
*  You know broken supply chains [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2147.7400000000002s)]
*  Riots whatever right like that's kind of the best-case scenario was just more of what we saw in 2020 and [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2150.74s)]
*  So I kind of dove deep into the the sort of prepper world most of its nonsense [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2158.14s)]
*  Most of it are clowns. I don't know what they're talking about you know like this [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2164.18s)]
*  But there are a group groups of people who who I think are pretty sophisticated [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2167.66s)]
*  How long did it take for you to realize that your bug out place in the North Carolina mountains? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2171.9799999999996s)]
*  January 1st 2021 is that is that right so that's not adequate [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2176.54s)]
*  Explain why that's not adequate because okay when Empire collapses the thing that matters most is community [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2181.02s)]
*  Who are you around? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2188.14s)]
*  How what skills do they have what skills do you have how well are you can your group band together and endure? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2190.22s)]
*  the tumultuous chaos until some new state steady state arises and [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2198.22s)]
*  Having a cabin in the woods is the opposite of community [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2205.54s)]
*  Right that was the the old school [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2210.5s)]
*  American thought of prepping is really based on nuclear war and hiding a bunker and like it's just nonsense [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2213.78s)]
*  It's not really thought out [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2219.5s)]
*  But if you go study end of Empire and you study people who've lived through intense chaos [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2221.42s)]
*  They all say the same thing right like there's a lot of window when the Roman Empire not the Republic when the Empire fell [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2226.34s)]
*  There were lots of places that did great because you know you can [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2233.8s)]
*  Some warlord or the local Roman general would just say okay like the [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2239.56s)]
*  We're we're gonna make this town my empire and the legions are gonna marry local girls [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2244.44s)]
*  And this is our area and those became I mean you can name them and all the gods allowed [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2250.96s)]
*  No chaos [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2256.6s)]
*  Lots of parts of golf thrived for thousands of years hundreds if not thousands of years after [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2258.4s)]
*  Because they had local rule all the sorts of things that work now the Roman Empire fell [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2264.52s)]
*  But for a lot of people [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2270.6800000000003s)]
*  In the aftermath of that did really well if they had great community right same with Mongolia same with [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2273.6800000000003s)]
*  Same with a lot of ways the British Empire though British Empire was a little different as a more modern Empire, but the point is [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2279.64s)]
*  Our my cabin in the woods had no community and so my wife and I [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2286.04s)]
*  How do we where can we go to find community? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2291.8799999999997s)]
*  How do we build a community and he starts by not a cabin in the woods but by by? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2294.2799999999997s)]
*  growing raising your own food [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2299.7999999999997s)]
*  Taking responsibility for water power and food [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2302.08s)]
*  but in the context of where a lot of other people are doing the same and so we we knew we wanted to say in Texas for [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2305.0s)]
*  a few reasons and [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2311.3999999999996s)]
*  We ended up picking dripping Springs [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2313.4s)]
*  It's not there's a lot of like kind of towns in Texas that are doing things like this [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2316.04s)]
*  Dripping is not the only one. It's the one that we like the best for a couple different reasons [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2322.28s)]
*  So we bought a homestead [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2326.8s)]
*  We actually we bought a place a beautiful ranch was not a homestead [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2328.8s)]
*  We've had to convert it to a homestead, but whatever and then we started to school and [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2332.2400000000002s)]
*  Encouraged it. So what's difference between a ranch and a homestead? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2337.52s)]
*  well [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2341.1600000000003s)]
*  Generally speaking a ranch is where you just like sort of raise livestock, but what we bought was [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2342.44s)]
*  Because I didn't know I didn't really understand land. I bought a place that this older guy this boomer [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2348.08s)]
*  Had had kind of carved out of nothing and it was beautiful [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2355.0s)]
*  Beautiful oak trees and rolling pasture, but it was dead like and I mean literally dead. The soil was dead [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2358.76s)]
*  Everything was dead because the way he dealt with the land was very 20th century kind of mentality [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2366.48s)]
*  it was [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2372.16s)]
*  Pestis pesticides kill the bugs herbicides kill the weeds [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  fertilizer raises the grass like [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2377.8399999999997s)]
*  That doesn't really work. Well, it works. It can work sort of for a while in certain circumstances [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2380.8799999999997s)]
*  But if you want to actually have a living thriving ecosystem [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  I kind of went deep in the permaculture and regenerative agriculture [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2390.8399999999997s)]
*  Worlds and I realized that those people had figured it out [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2394.6s)]
*  And so what we had to do was stop all came I had to fire all the people he had that were working there the [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2397.6s)]
*  Landscapers or whatever, you know, everything was irrigated [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2403.72s)]
*  It was he had st. Augustine grass which requires like 130 inches of rain a year in Texas, right? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2406.72s)]
*  Like so you're not getting 130 inches of rain and he was irrigating but nonetheless, it's like what are we doing? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2412.72s)]
*  This doesn't make sense with our land and where we are and so the last two years I've spent essentially [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2418.56s)]
*  Turning it into living soil and regenerating the land and doing management practices that makes sense for dripping Springs [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2425.8s)]
*  Texas for 30 inches of rain a year and you know like and now we have like it's it's [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2433.8s)]
*  Not where it's gonna be in three four or five years, but it's good man. We've got a [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2439.6400000000003s)]
*  big flock of sheep bees [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2444.1200000000003s)]
*  We have meat chickens egg chickens, you know, like we have you know garden [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2446.1600000000003s)]
*  We're starting to put in all kinds of stuff and so we're totally independent water totally independent meat [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2451.56s)]
*  Totally independent we can be totally independent power [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2458.4s)]
*  we're hooked on the grid because why would we be independent before you have to be but [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2461.24s)]
*  We have a system where we can endure a lot of chaos and be totally fine and we're surrounded by people in our community [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2465.24s)]
*  Who are for the most part in the same position are very similar. They have similar values similar approach to the world [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2473.0s)]
*  You know, we that's why we started we started a Waldo school literally three minutes from so for viewers [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2481.56s)]
*  You're not familiar with Waldorf. What is that? So there's lots of different educational philosophies [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2486.72s)]
*  Acton Montessori public school [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2491.7599999999998s)]
*  Waldorf is a philosophy started in Germany like 150 years ago [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2495.52s)]
*  And I think it is by far of the educational philosophies. It's by far the best [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2499.52s)]
*  It is the one that kind of feeds emotional side [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2504.6s)]
*  It kind of it's like a Renaissance style right where it kind of tries to help the whole child [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2508.32s)]
*  To help create the whole child of the educational styles. I think it's the best [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2513.0s)]
*  That being said I'm still not sure if organized schooling is right for kids or not because right now we have one kid [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2517.52s)]
*  I'm homeschooling because he doesn't have enough kids in his class for for the Waldo like there's just aren't kids [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2523.84s)]
*  He doesn't have a class there [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2528.88s)]
*  But the other two are Waldo a Waldo is the best by far if you're gonna go to a school [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2529.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm on the fence about which is better [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2534.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm on the fence about which is better. So all of your children are out of the public schools [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2536.16s)]
*  Oh never went into public schools. My man. I wouldn't I don't hate my kids [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2540.2s)]
*  I'm never gonna send them to public schools [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2545.24s)]
*  And it raises a philosophical and I want to put this the president states right with the message [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2547.4s)]
*  I think is relevant to you, which is that those are not your kids. Actually here he is [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2553.3599999999997s)]
*  Rebecca put a teacher's creed into words when she said there's no such thing as someone else's child [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2558.92s)]
*  No such thing as someone else's child our nation's children are all our children [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2565.56s)]
*  So your kids are really his kids. He owns your kids [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2571.6000000000004s)]
*  It's like when people say, you know, I'm coming to take your guns like we'll stack up [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2575.2000000000003s)]
*  Stack up and come get them same with kids. No, those are my kids and my those children are mine and my wife's now [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2579.32s)]
*  I will say [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2586.08s)]
*  Let's give it a very [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2587.92s)]
*  judicious [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2590.04s)]
*  Interpretation if what he means and I don't think this is what he means [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2592.6s)]
*  But if what he means is I don't own my children like their chattel or slaves that they are independent beings and my job is to [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2595.24s)]
*  Steward them totally agree totally on board. Yes in no way shape or form [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2602.6s)]
*  Do I think my kids should live their lives based on what I want? They should live it on what they want [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2606.96s)]
*  Totally on board. I see my job is to help them become full people. Yes and find the lives they want. I [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2612.52s)]
*  Don't think that's what he means I think what he means is the very [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2618.48s)]
*  Typical bureaucratic really it's a really a communist Marxist idea that children are the property of the state [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2622.68s)]
*  That the citizens are the property of the state that is and you disagree with that [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2629.92s)]
*  I [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2635.2400000000002s)]
*  Disagreements not strong enough. It's not a strong enough term. Yeah, like I there's just no chance that's going to exist in my words [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2636.88s)]
*  Yeah, just not so I always thought I mean, of course I vehemently agree with you [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2645.68s)]
*  But the number of parents who presumably love their kids more than their own lives most parents do [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2650.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think who are willing to let not just Alzheimer's patients posing as president [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2656.52s)]
*  But any representative the state just kind of come in do whatever they want their kids [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2661.9s)]
*  Sexualize their kids basically like kiddie porn shit with their kids and they allow it [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2666.76s)]
*  Why? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2672.26s)]
*  Man, it's a good question. I don't know because like clearly I would never in a million years allow anything like that [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2675.12s)]
*  I think most people can only give their kids what they got and most people were raised [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2682.3s)]
*  By people who went to public schools and they went to public schools and they were rate public schools are designed to create [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2689.4s)]
*  obedience [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2698.16s)]
*  Employees like that's the most charitable, right? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2700.4s)]
*  Sort of interpretation maintains the surf class. That's the does that is that and I'm not saying this [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2705.2400000000002s)]
*  This isn't like a conspiracy theory or a metaphor like there's a guy John Taylor [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2710.84s)]
*  Gatto who wrote a couple great books about this [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2715.64s)]
*  The literal stated goal Horace man all those people who invented the the the American public educational system their stated goal is to create [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2719.56s)]
*  subservient employees who know how to be good citizens and [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2729.44s)]
*  Like that's just I didn't I didn't have children for that reason to serve some other man or woman or some [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2733.84s)]
*  faceless bureaucratic entity no, and so if someone [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2741.8s)]
*  Was raised by people who went to public school who were just employees and that's who they are [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2746.48s)]
*  It's hard. I I mean this like not judgmentally. I can imagine to be really hard for that person to understand [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2752.84s)]
*  Well, this is where I went. This was good enough for me [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2759.62s)]
*  They're supposed to be experts. Why wouldn't they know better, you know, um, I [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2762.8399999999997s)]
*  can understand how a [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2767.52s)]
*  Lot of people would get to that spot. Now. The good news is all this nonsense [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2770.24s)]
*  lunacy with trans and other crap in schools [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2775.3199999999997s)]
*  Sexualizing little children is a lot of people starting to wake up and realize what I mean [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2779.3599999999997s)]
*  I knew this I had never had any plan to send my kids to public school [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2783.74s)]
*  Like that was never I went to public schools mostly and I realized how [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2787.56s)]
*  Nonsense they were when I was there. My parents weren't very good, but they weirdly they gave me a great a gift [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2793.4399999999996s)]
*  They weren't they were not good parents. They they weren't bad people [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2799.48s)]
*  They were just bad parents and but but their bad parenting gave me a gift [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2802.64s)]
*  They didn't pretend that they cared like they didn't mix a lot of seriously [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2806.7999999999997s)]
*  People laugh but I'm telling you man it so many people that was the that was the upside of my bad [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2812.8399999999997s)]
*  No, it was my parents didn't pretend they cared so many people's parents or caregivers mixed love with abuse [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2818.22s)]
*  And so so many people see those things together [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2825.3999999999996s)]
*  My parents didn't really pretend they cared much and so like I never [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2829.44s)]
*  Mixed love and abuse and also they didn't really show up much for me [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2834.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I realized that a young age of the adults weren't coming [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2838.52s)]
*  Yeah, and the adults were for the most part didn't know what the hell they were doing [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2841.36s)]
*  They didn't ever pretend they were experts or knew what they were doing or had the right answers, right? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2844.84s)]
*  And so it's like they were so bad that in a way that they were good. They set me up to see the reality [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2851.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's I just love your attitude about your childhood. That's a wonderful attitude to have [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2857.4s)]
*  Well, I got there after a lot of emotional work a lot of therapy a lot of psychedelic medicine a lot of work [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2862.44s)]
*  I [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2867.68s)]
*  Wasn't always like that. I was angry for a while. This is pointless to be mad about the past [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2869.28s)]
*  Anger can serve a purpose for a period if it gets you out of shame or or other sort of [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2874.8s)]
*  Essentially anti-life emotions angers a powerful motivating emotion, but if you stay stuck there, it's not good [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2880.68s)]
*  I was stuck there is your wife totally on board with these attitudes [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2886.44s)]
*  100% oh, yeah [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2890.32s)]
*  My wife I would not be married to her if she wasn't if we didn't share these values [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2891.32s)]
*  We were very aligned in a lot of stuff when we met and we've she's done a lot of her own emotional [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2895.7999999999997s)]
*  Therapeutic work as well and and we both have grown so much together over the last ten years in parallel ways [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2900.8799999999997s)]
*  but I've seen people who [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2909.04s)]
*  Who split in the last three four years because their values just weren't different like they were the split was already there [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2912.04s)]
*  But this kind of forced it [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2917.54s)]
*  So you you've organized your life around? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2919.44s)]
*  Surviving what you think is coming and protecting what's here? What's not what what's here now? [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2922.16s)]
*  So what do you think and then what might come? [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2928.12s)]
*  What do you think might come like what does that look like? I have no idea right the the range of outcomes [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2930.52s)]
*  I think is are extremely wide, but you're working to mitigate against those eventualities or those possibilities [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2935.72s)]
*  You can't prevent everything right like if an asteroid hits, you know, Florida [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2941.2799999999997s)]
*  Nothing I'm doing is probably gonna make any difference right like where it's it's 95% of people are gonna die [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2947.7599999999998s)]
*  It's gonna be horrible. It's gonna be Armageddon and in my you know, having a flock of sheep staggers [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2953.0s)]
*  but I [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2960.12s)]
*  aside [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2962.6s)]
*  holding aside really truly catastrophic, you know Noah's Ark type situations [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2963.88s)]
*  I think the range of possibilities are [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2970.6s)]
*  Basically we're if we're seeing collapse of Empire American Empire [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2974.5600000000004s)]
*  Which I think we are not notice the collapse of the American state but the collapse of the American Empire. I [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2978.6800000000003s)]
*  think the lot my whole life basically the American [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2985.04s)]
*  consumerist experience has been based on [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2991.2400000000002s)]
*  essentially free or low-cost [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2994.6400000000003s)]
*  goods in [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2997.32s)]
*  Everything whether it's food or housing or everything was really cheap or really easy to get and [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=2998.92s)]
*  I think it's just that period is ending and nothing else [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3006.84s)]
*  Then we're in for a major shock [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3012.12s)]
*  Culturally a major shock though. Maybe a lot of the rest of world isn't we are now on top of that [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3015.2000000000003s)]
*  Unfortunately and sadly, excuse me. I think World War three whatever you want to call it is inevitable [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3022.1600000000003s)]
*  I think the US [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3027.56s)]
*  Without going too deep in this rabbit hole the US debt has gotten to the point where a war is necessary [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3029.9199999999996s)]
*  I mean it's all when empires rack up too much debt [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3038.08s)]
*  The only thing left for them to do to save it usually is war and then that doesn't save it that you that goes out [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3041.96s)]
*  It's a line [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3048.46s)]
*  Right exactly [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3050.0s)]
*  There was a point where the US debt was totally saved definitely during the Clinton administration [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3051.04s)]
*  And maybe even as recently as the Obama administration if the Fed had refinanced [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3055.76s)]
*  All of net or a huge amount of national debt when the interest was essentially zero [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3060.6800000000003s)]
*  We'd be in a very different situation, but they didn't and so that plus the massive [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3065.0s)]
*  stimulus bill stimulus bills what they were was graphed but the [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3071.76s)]
*  That plus the response to kovat [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3076.92s)]
*  that they were pass appointed overtime and so what happens when government [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3080.28s)]
*  defaults [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3086.0s)]
*  war [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3087.4s)]
*  And then a lot of other consequences from that [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3088.7200000000003s)]
*  So I don't know the details no one does because I think there's a lot of ways it could play out [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3091.2400000000002s)]
*  I just want to ensure regardless of what happens up to a certain point [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3095.88s)]
*  That me and my family and my community can endure that because I don't think it's gonna last forever [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3101.5200000000004s)]
*  Disasters and emergencies don't last forever. There's another side [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3108.6400000000003s)]
*  I actually think America is really well set up to come out the other end of that in a really positive place [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3111.7999999999997s)]
*  It's just gonna be painful to get there. You know so here's one [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3118.92s)]
*  potential [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3123.92s)]
*  Mid to short-term outcome which is that we continue pushing for war with Iran [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3125.2s)]
*  Yes, which apparently doesn't yet have nuclear weapons [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3130.0s)]
*  Yeah, we do Israel does the whole coalition a raid against Iran has them they don't so how do they respond well? [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3133.0s)]
*  Maybe they just unplug the United States [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3139.32s)]
*  Maybe a cyber attack or EMP attack who know takes out totally possible our digital life totally possible [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3142.08s)]
*  so that would you know, I can't even know what to think about what that would look like but [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3148.76s)]
*  Where would that leave you on your homestead? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3153.56s)]
*  Are you living a life that could [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3157.8s)]
*  Withstand that I'm not a I'm not a huge believer and now you have to be off-grid and you got to be living like the Amish [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3160.2s)]
*  I [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3166.28s)]
*  First off I don't off-grid doesn't exist even the Amish aren't off-grid [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3167.5200000000004s)]
*  If you think about it like they don't mind their own or and they don't smelt it right so not you know [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3171.4s)]
*  Disparaging the Amish like believe me I've like been man these dudes had some stuff figured out [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3178.8s)]
*  I didn't realize you're pro Amish for the record, but maybe pro certain things [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3182.82s)]
*  about Amish, but um [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3187.76s)]
*  No, I I don't think off-grid exists [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3189.36s)]
*  And I'm not a believer in oh you if you're not doing everything hand it doesn't work [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3191.72s)]
*  I don't I don't want to make my life hard for no reason [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3196.68s)]
*  That's not I just want to make sure that there is a lot of coming political and social [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3200.6s)]
*  Appeal it's there's a lot of political and social people now [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3206.7599999999998s)]
*  It's already happening and I think it's gonna get worse and I want to make sure [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3209.7599999999998s)]
*  That I'm in the best place possible to survive that I'm not trying to [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3215.8799999999997s)]
*  To go you know be the Unabomber and live only off the land and only have things that you know like [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3219.84s)]
*  Ancient man had like that's if you want to do that cool. I I I like electricity [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3226.44s)]
*  But you're not making your own bombs like dude. I I like electricity. I like air-conditioning. I live in Texas [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3231.2000000000003s)]
*  I really like air conditioning. It's pretty crucial for us. I like modern conveniences [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3236.32s)]
*  I want to continue using those as much as possible, and that makes sense, but I also [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3241.2000000000003s)]
*  If I had to say the big shift I've made in my mindset man is that I was like when I was in college [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3246.2s)]
*  You don't go work for [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3252.04s)]
*  Goldman Sachs or go to law school unless you are deep in the consumerist mindset [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3254.04s)]
*  I think that one of the major [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3258.56s)]
*  psychological shifts I've made is I've gotten out of the consumerist mindset to [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3260.96s)]
*  more of a [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3266.48s)]
*  Like a shepherd mindset right and and I think it's one of the travesties that can you [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3268.48s)]
*  Can you just flesh it out a little bit? What do you say consumerist mindset? What do you mean? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3274.16s)]
*  consumerist mindset means I live to [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3278.12s)]
*  consume [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3281.2799999999997s)]
*  Resources and status and like my what are basically our most of our parents were I [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3284.72s)]
*  Want the house in the suburbs? You know I'm gonna have these vacations. I'm gonna go to these places [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3291.2s)]
*  I'm gonna have this rank in my society. It's it's an externally [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3296.64s)]
*  Created identity right that consumer because what do you even know what to consume right? [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3303.36s)]
*  It's what your screen what your media tells you is important and what you should be consuming [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3308.36s)]
*  Where's your status come from where you know what matters what car is cool or not what clothes are cool or not? [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3313.88s)]
*  That's a consumerist mindset, right? I [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3319.2000000000003s)]
*  Of course I was I'm American so I was deeply enmeshed and immersed in that growing up, but the more [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3322.6s)]
*  One of the great travesties I think of the last 30 years is that the conservation movement in the environmental movement weren't [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3329.14s)]
*  One in the same they were kind of enemies for a long time [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3336.18s)]
*  and I think though now you're starting to see the permaculturists and the [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3339.18s)]
*  regenerative agriculture and the hunters and the [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3344.18s)]
*  Conservationists really come together and realize we're all on the same side right and I I am a big believer like I mean like your studio [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3347.74s)]
*  right like I really want to live in harmony with [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3355.46s)]
*  Not just my family in my community [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3360.62s)]
*  But my the environment around me the soil around the grass nature and everyone says that [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3363.34s)]
*  But like not many people actually do that [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3369.78s)]
*  They live a very a life that is divorced from the actual soil around them and the trees around them and the animals around them [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3372.2200000000003s)]
*  And the last two years I if you'd asked me two years ago if I live in harmony with nature [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3379.58s)]
*  I'd be like yeah, I like to think I do I didn't at all and I had no idea what it even meant to live in harmony [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3384.18s)]
*  With nature and having a homestead what's so awesome about having a homestead is that has forced me [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3390.22s)]
*  To live in reality you can you can have your phone and [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3397.22s)]
*  Consumers minds that you can live in abstraction [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3402.1s)]
*  Everything is abstract [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3404.62s)]
*  But when you live whether having a homestead or a ranch or farm or hunting [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3405.8199999999997s)]
*  You have to actually pay attention to reality or nothing works [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3411.24s)]
*  Nothing right and it has grounded me in a way that I thought I was grounded [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3416.16s)]
*  But I wasn't and that's a huge reason why I wanted to get on land my wife [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3420.9199999999996s)]
*  And I wanted to get on land is because we craved that in our lives as we did emotional work and dealt with our issues [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3425.72s)]
*  We felt the divorce from the world and wanted to get more integrated into the natural world [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3431.3999999999996s)]
*  But then also wanted to raise our kids that way so that they never had to be divorced from that and had to [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3438.2799999999997s)]
*  Find their way back to it right like I thought the whole point of public school is to separate the child from the family and [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3444.2s)]
*  orient them in [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3452.3599999999997s)]
*  bureaucratic corporatist consumerist society and [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3455.04s)]
*  I mean like [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3458.96s)]
*  I'm kind of torn because like I like electricity and I like cool stuff [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3460.6s)]

*  I want my children to grow up on land with their hands in dirt [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3474.7s)]
*  Understanding first self-knowledge above all things and that is the opposite of what you learn in public everything public school is [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3480.08s)]
*  Coming from experts obey do what you're told. Here's how life works the way our children grow up [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3487.28s)]

*  I [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3522.8399999999997s)]
*  Didn't realize how poisoned and how toxic almost everything in our culture is not just American the world's like the way humans relate to [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3524.36s)]
*  Each other it was just yeah, and give me an example when you say poisonous. What do you mean? [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3533.44s)]
*  Food you want to talk about food yeah, all right, so [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3538.48s)]
*  Virtually everything you find in a grocery store is at best unhealthy at worst [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3543.24s)]
*  Literal poison like my favorite example [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3550.6000000000004s)]
*  Most people in America now for cooking use seed oils canola oil canola oil is [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3554.36s)]
*  Was literally invented as a an a lubricant for machines [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3561.6000000000004s)]
*  Okay, it was used. I forget the exact history of it, but it is machine lubricant [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3568.0s)]
*  It is so toxic and horrible for the body, and it's in everything now [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3574.26s)]
*  a [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3579.06s)]
*  Huge reason that we wanted a homestead and to raise our own meat and our own vegetables is because it's really hard to get healthy [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3579.62s)]
*  Food anywhere even at farmers markets sometimes it's hard to get it [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3587.18s)]
*  But like go find something in a grocery store that doesn't have a seed oil in it. It's almost impossible even at Whole Foods [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3591.06s)]
*  Unless you're on the outer rim right unless you're taking a head of lettuce or something like that if it's in a package [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3599.18s)]
*  Something like I forget 70 plus percent of stuff in packages in Whole Foods has seed oils in it [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3607.74s)]
*  And it's poison. It's absolutely and do you feel the difference having gotten off it? I mean, I'm 48 years old [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3614.54s)]

*  I just don't eat the poisonous stuff. I just paid I'm like, okay, I'm gonna try and only eat meat from my homestead and [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3663.14s)]
*  like I you know, I'm [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3671.98s)]
*  Metabolically if you look at all the markers like my genetic age is like in the 20s [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3674.5s)]
*  I don't do anything that special man. I'm not like out, you know working out six hours a day or any nonsense like that [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3678.2999999999997s)]
*  I just eat healthy and healthy means like I know where all my meat comes from [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3684.62s)]
*  All the lamb and chicken I eat born on my ranch raised on my ranch killed on my ranch [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3689.9s)]
*  Processed on my ranch butchered on my ranch eaten on my ranch [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3695.7799999999997s)]
*  It says it's as God intended what goes in it is grass [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3700.62s)]
*  And water or bugs if it's chickens. That's it [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3706.14s)]
*  You mentioned God [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3711.34s)]
*  offhandedly [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3713.34s)]
*  As your view of the eternal changed radically [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3714.8199999999997s)]
*  radically [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3719.2599999999998s)]
*  So at 20s, I think at a certain point in your life if you if you are educated and you believe in God [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3720.2599999999998s)]
*  This is gonna be controversial. I don't mean it bad [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3727.9399999999996s)]
*  I think you're stupid if you're not an atheist at some point early on in your life because you can't I don't believe you [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3729.8999999999996s)]
*  Can reason your way to God? No, I know st. Augustine. I love whatever I'm with you and [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3735.62s)]
*  Thomas more. Okay, fine [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3741.1s)]
*  I don't buy I I just don't think you get to God from reason and so I was atheist my whole life because [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3742.38s)]
*  God never made sense if you think logically is that me grew up [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3749.46s)]
*  I grew up actually in the Episcopal Church like I was an acolyte in the episcopal but you know Episcopal Church is like a [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3752.6600000000003s)]
*  Social club. It's not you don't yes. I'm very familiar. Yes [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3757.58s)]
*  Hey, you know like I literally thought we went to church to eat donuts and socialize [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3760.6600000000003s)]
*  I didn't know anyone believed that because it was preposterous to me if you look at it reasonably and rationally and [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3765.56s)]
*  then [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3771.5800000000004s)]
*  It was about [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3773.98s)]
*  four years ago I [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3775.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's funny. I had never done. I drank a lot never done any drugs in my life ever until I found [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3777.98s)]
*  Part of my therapeutic protocols. I did psychedelic medicine, right like MDMA [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3785.34s)]
*  LSD mushrooms, but psychic like with a guide and and not recreationally [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3790.38s)]
*  I don't know how you do that stuff people take LSD and go to concerts. I took LSD and cried and found God [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3795.0600000000004s)]
*  like and it was the experience for me was not like talking to God it was I [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3800.3s)]
*  Felt the oneness of all things and I felt the connection to all things and I felt I [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3805.82s)]
*  Understood like I knew Jesus is in Buddhist teachings academically [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3813.38s)]
*  But then I was like it was one very specific experience [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3817.62s)]
*  It was LSD and I remember thinking oh fuck the kingdom of heaven is within now [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3820.54s)]
*  I know what Jesus was talking about like and if you meet a Buddha on the road kill him like oh now [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3826.06s)]
*  I know a Buddha was talking man [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3832.14s)]
*  I have a really good friend who's Mormon and he's the type of Mormon that like, you know [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3833.22s)]
*  You meet some Christians and they just have that energy and glow and you're like, yeah [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3837.58s)]
*  Christians were like this like yeah, I don't know what you're into but I want to know more [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3840.62s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of those guys and I called him two days after my thing and I'm like [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3844.74s)]
*  then you [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3850.18s)]
*  When you say you have a relationship with God you mean that literally like it's an experience for you he goes, bro [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3852.58s)]
*  I've been trying to tell you this for a decade and I'm like, I thought you were stupid [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3857.94s)]
*  Thought you were fooled. I thought you just read the words and got fooled by them. What you have is the actual spiritual connection [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3862.2999999999997s)]
*  He's like, yeah, and I did not understand religion [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3870.06s)]
*  I understood I I didn't understand spirituality or belief in God until I had the experience and for me [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3873.8999999999996s)]
*  I had to get there on psychedelics. I don't really feel like I do now the psychedelics were important to open me up [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3879.78s)]
*  But now I think I can I have enough of a connection to source to God whatever you want to call it [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3885.26s)]
*  I'm very [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3891.46s)]
*  Very much a god guy, but not in the way most god guys are like not a religious way. Like I think religious dogma [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3893.3s)]
*  Some people need it and they like it and that's cool. I don't need dogma [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3899.94s)]
*  I think dogma it gets in the way and I think if you actually look at the teachings of Christ and definitely the teachings of [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3903.1200000000003s)]
*  Buddha they say the same thing that the dogma is not the thing and is in fact in the way [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3907.94s)]
*  Although Buddha will say he says that but he's like, you know [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3913.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll give you the the eightfold path and all that to help you then you shed it when it's time [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3915.98s)]
*  This is your wife in the same place you are I think pretty much. How's it changed your life? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3921.62s)]
*  That's like [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3929.3s)]
*  Cuz that's like a different way of seeing in every in every single way. I I got past consumerism because of this [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3930.58s)]
*  Because once you once you realize not realize intellectually once you feel [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3937.02s)]
*  The one and some people can get there like a church and some people get there with yoga [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3941.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm not I'm not saying my way is better or worse. It's just the way once I felt the oneness of all things [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3945.7s)]
*  all of the frivolities and the nonsense and the lies of the modern narrative fell away and [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3953.8999999999996s)]
*  Then for me it was like oh, of course [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3960.1s)]
*  Of course being connected to land matters, we're all energy. We're all part of the same system [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3964.06s)]
*  I'm not different than this land or this chicken or this sheep. Yeah, I'm a human as a chicken, right? [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3969.92s)]
*  But we're all part world parts of the same system. We're all parts of God and if that if you want to call the system [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3974.98s)]
*  God I'm on board [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3980.2799999999997s)]
*  And and if that's true, then my entire approach before that's what's toxic seeing myself as separate from this system as [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3981.58s)]
*  different than the system [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3990.86s)]
*  No, that's just not true. Do you think I don't I don't know maybe I'm imagining it [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3992.54s)]
*  But it does seem like the people in charge do a lot to discourage these kinds of thoughts these conversations people coming together to have these [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=3997.14s)]
*  Conversations they're very against religious faith. Everything I just said is [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4004.7799999999997s)]
*  absolutely [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4010.14s)]
*  Completely [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4012.3s)]
*  catastrophically counter to all things government [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4014.3s)]
*  In all ways shapes and forms I don't think it's an accident that the reigning governmental power at the time killed Jesus [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4018.76s)]
*  I don't think it's an accident that anyone who preaches anything like this [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4025.6800000000003s)]
*  Comes crossways of power because most organized power tells you [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4032.48s)]
*  However, they frame the message the message from organized power is you need me [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4038.88s)]
*  You need me that's right and the message from Jesus and from God let's just stick with Christianity is you don't need them [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4043.58s)]
*  I [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4055.58s)]
*  Knew I'd never met you before yeah [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4057.38s)]
*  we've not and I and I have a ton of daughters so and I did when you were writing your books and [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4059.38s)]
*  You know whatever I wasn't living that kind of life but I could tell you were a deep person [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlEz9Jz0tOM&t=4066.94s)]
