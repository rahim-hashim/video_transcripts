# Tucker Carlson Interviews President of Iran Masoud Pezeshkian
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM)
*  Mr. President, thank you very much for doing this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=0.0s)]
*  There is a pause, or seems to be a pause, in the war between the United States and Iran. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=2.84s)]
*  How do you think this will end? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=9.5s)]
*  How would you like to see it end? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=11.28s)]
*  We did not start this war, and we do not want this war to continue in any way. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=16.28s)]
*  From the very beginning, it was the motto of my administration that I always adhere [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=23.96s)]
*  to, and that was fostering the national unity inside the country, and also fostering peace [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=30.76s)]
*  and tranquility and friendship with the neighboring countries and with the rest of the world. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=39.2s)]
*  The American President Donald Trump has said that the United States bombed your enrichment [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=44.96s)]
*  facilities because the government of Iran refused to give up its nuclear program, and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=51.2s)]
*  that there can be no peace until Iran does give up that nuclear program. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  Would you be willing to give up the nuclear program in exchange for peace? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=63.64s)]
*  I would like to tell you what has happened. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=69.76s)]
*  It was Netanyahu, since 1984, has created this false mentality that Iran seeks a nuclear [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=73.4s)]
*  bomb, and it has insinuated that Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb in the past, and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=85.68s)]
*  it has put it in the minds of every U.S. president since then, and to make them believe [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=94.8s)]
*  that we would like to have a nuclear bomb. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=103.47999999999999s)]
*  But the truth is that we have never been after developing a nuclear bomb, not in the past, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=106.92s)]
*  not presently, or in the future, because this is wrong, and this is in contrast to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=113.72s)]
*  the religious decree or the fatwa which has been issued by his eminence, the Supreme Leader [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=125.88s)]
*  of the Islamic Republic of Iran, that so it is religiously forbidden for us to go after [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=132.38s)]
*  a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=139.88s)]
*  This was always corroborated thanks to our cooperation with IAEA, because they were always [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=142.12s)]
*  there to verify this and to substantiate that we have never wanted a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=151.92s)]
*  But unfortunately, this cooperation was disturbed by the unlawful attacks against our nuclear [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=160.51999999999998s)]
*  facilities. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=167.64s)]
*  So you have, according to news reports, withdrawn your cooperation from IAEA, the International [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=170.36s)]
*  Nuclear Regulatory Agency, and so there's, I suppose, no way for the rest of the world [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  to know how much uranium you're enriching and to what extent, to what percentage it's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  being enriched. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=189.44000000000003s)]
*  And so is there any way to verify, and would you be willing to allow other nations to verify [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=191.44000000000003s)]
*  that you are not building nuclear weapons? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=198.28s)]
*  Mr. Carson, sir, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we were right in [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=201.28s)]
*  the middle of holding talks with the United States, and the President of the United States [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=209.12s)]
*  invited us to hold such talks in order to have peace. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=216.04s)]
*  And we were told during the process of these negotiations and talks that as long as we [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=222.52s)]
*  don't give the permission to Israel, they are not going to attack you. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=231.28s)]
*  And we were going to have the next round of the talks very soon, but in the middle of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=235.96s)]
*  it, suddenly Israel torpedoed the negotiating table. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=243.76s)]
*  We were sitting at the negotiating table when it happened, and by doing this, they totally [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=250.92s)]
*  ruined and destroyed diplomacy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=256.6s)]
*  And in order to answer your question with regards to the surveillance or the supervision [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=260.96s)]
*  over our nuclear program, I would like to say that we are ready to hold talks over it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=267.04s)]
*  We have never been the party that has run away from verification. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=273.2s)]
*  We stand ready to have these supervisions, but unfortunately, as a result of the United [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  States unlawful attacks against our nuclear centers and installations, many of the pieces [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=289.36s)]
*  of equipment and the facilities there have been severely damaged. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=295.2s)]
*  Therefore, we don't have any access to them. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=300.44s)]
*  We cannot see. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=303.24s)]
*  And unless this access is going to be back there again, we have to wait for it and to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=307.04s)]
*  see what happens and how much they have been damaged so that we can go for the supervision. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=313.8s)]
*  There have been news reports that you believe, your government believes that the IAEA was [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=319.32s)]
*  spying on the government of Iran and passing information to Israel. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=326.04s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  And if so, do you have evidence that that's true, that the world could see? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=332.68s)]
*  I would like to tell you that we were, yes, somehow pessimistic about the activities of [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=338.6s)]
*  the IAEA because somehow we realized that Israel could get information from the inspections [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=344.2s)]
*  which were carried out by the IAEA, but it never prevented the IAEA from carrying out [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=352.96s)]
*  their activities inside Iran and they had full access to supervise and to have surveillance [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=360.48s)]
*  over our nuclear facilities. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=366.84s)]
*  But there was this lack of trust as a result of the last report by IAEA, the type of the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=369.56s)]
*  report, and the way they prepared the report somehow gave an excuse to the Israeli regime [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=382.12s)]
*  and prepared the ground for their unlawful and unauthorized attack against our nuclear [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=388.88000000000005s)]
*  facilities. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  And even after that, the IAEA failed to condemn these attacks or try to any way to stop them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=398.52000000000004s)]
*  This ran counter to the international law and this resulted in a widespread lack of [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=409.2s)]
*  trust among the Iranians, Iranian legislators, and the public opinion here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=418.28s)]
*  You've suggested that you were anxious to resolve your conflicts with the United States [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=425.52s)]
*  through diplomacy and that that was derailed by war. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=429.96s)]
*  Would you be willing to restart diplomacy? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=433.28s)]
*  Could you tell us in general but precise terms the kind of deal you would be willing to accept? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=436.04s)]
*  I am of the belief that we could very much easily resolve our differences and conflicts [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=445.8s)]
*  with the United States through dialogue and talks. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=454.16s)]
*  The international law could serve as the framework or the basis for a deal in which the rights [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  of all nations, the Iranian nation, would be respected. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=471.8s)]
*  But unfortunately, it was Netanyahu that destroyed these diplomacy and these efforts, diplomatic [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=477.68s)]
*  efforts. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=488.8s)]
*  We never wanted anything beyond the respect for our rights, rightful rights enshrined [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=491.32s)]
*  in international law. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=499.88s)]
*  But as I said, it was Netanyahu that wanted, that brought unrest to our region and is fomenting [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=502.52s)]
*  unrest and tensions in the region. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  As I have always said, we have always been after peace. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=516.12s)]
*  It has been my motto. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=520.52s)]
*  It has been my belief. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=521.92s)]
*  It has been my heartfelt opinion that we need to live in peace and harmony during this short [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=523.28s)]
*  and limited time granted to us by God Almighty to live in peace and tranquility with everybody. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=533.2s)]
*  And everybody in the world should live like that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=540.8s)]
*  But I would also like, on the other hand, to reiterate that our people are capable enough [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=544.5999999999999s)]
*  to defend themselves in self-defense during any kind of attack. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=551.0799999999999s)]
*  And I believe that the United States president can very well guide the region and the world [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=558.0s)]
*  to peace and tranquility, or on the other hand, to lead it to forever wars. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=566.48s)]
*  Do you have plans to re-enter negotiations with the United States, with envoy Steve Witkoff [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=576.64s)]
*  or anyone else? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=584.4s)]
*  And if not, what do you think will happen? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=585.96s)]
*  We see no problem in re-entering the negotiations. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=592.68s)]
*  But before that, I have to remind you that because of the atrocities by the Zionist regime, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=599.3199999999999s)]
*  by Israel, not just against my country, but in the whole region, we are now facing a crisis. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=607.0s)]
*  The people are facing a crisis that we need to put it behind ourselves. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=614.64s)]
*  Our commanders were off duty. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=621.64s)]
*  They were spending the night at their homes with their families, but they were killed. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=624.68s)]
*  And this is considered a war crime, according to the international law, because they were [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=631.92s)]
*  off duty, as I said. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  Our scientists were also killed and assassinated along with their families and their wives [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=640.0s)]
*  and their children. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=647.88s)]
*  They were also killed, pregnant women, children. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=649.28s)]
*  They were killed in the atrocities, in the attacks of the Israeli regime. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=654.68s)]
*  Just because they wanted to kill one single person, they had to demolish and destroy a [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=660.4399999999999s)]
*  whole building. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=667.92s)]
*  And as a result of this, a lot of innocent people were killed. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=669.68s)]
*  A lot of people were killed. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=674.48s)]
*  And as I said, there is this crisis that we have to put it behind ourselves. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=676.9200000000001s)]
*  And there is a condition, there is a provision for the restarting the talks. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=683.7600000000001s)]
*  How are we going to trust the United States again? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=693.1600000000001s)]
*  We re-enter the negotiations. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=698.4000000000001s)]
*  How can we know for sure that in the middle of the talks, the Israeli regime will not [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=701.96s)]
*  be given the permission again to attack us? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=710.84s)]
*  Do you believe the Israeli government tried to assassinate you? [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=715.48s)]
*  They did try, yes. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=719.04s)]
*  And they acted accordingly, but they failed. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=723.4s)]
*  And as a true believer, I believe that it is in the hands of the God Almighty to determine [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=729.48s)]
*  when a person will die or will not die. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=737.08s)]
*  If he wills, the God Almighty wills, then you can die when you are walking freely in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=742.36s)]
*  the streets. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=748.36s)]
*  I would like to tell you that I am not afraid of sacrificing myself in defense of my country [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=750.84s)]
*  and in safeguarding and defending the sovereignty, the freedom and the independence of my country. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=760.76s)]
*  I'm willing to give my life, to give blood for that. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=769.4s)]
*  Nobody here, I mean, none of the government officials is afraid of losing their lives [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=773.48s)]
*  in line of defense. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=782.44s)]
*  But will it bring security to the region? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=784.6s)]
*  I mean, bloodshed, more bloodshed, assassination, killing others. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=788.44s)]
*  Will it bring peace and tranquility and stability to the region? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=793.64s)]
*  With respect, can you tell us how you know that you were an assassination target? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=798.36s)]
*  A week and a half ago, I don't believe I've seen that confirmed to anywhere. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=802.92s)]
*  How are you certain they tried to kill you? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=808.92s)]
*  Of course, it was not the US that was behind the attempt on my life. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=811.64s)]
*  It was Israel. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=823.2s)]
*  I was in a meeting. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=825.2s)]
*  We were discussing the ways to move forward. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=827.48s)]
*  But thanks to the intelligence by the spies that they had, they tried to bombard the area [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=832.36s)]
*  that we were holding that meeting in which we were holding that meeting. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=842.04s)]
*  But as I told you before, it is God who wills when a person will die and give up his life. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=848.28s)]
*  Once again, I would like to emphasize that we are not afraid of martyrdom. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=857.56s)]
*  We are not afraid of sacrificing our lives for our people, for our independence. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=863.64s)]
*  And I would like to tell you that this imposed war by the Israeli regime resulted in one thing, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=869.9599999999999s)]
*  and that was more solidarity and unity amongst the Iranian people. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=876.1999999999999s)]
*  It proved yet once again that the Iranian people, no matter where they are in the whole [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=882.1999999999999s)]
*  wide world, they do care about their country, about the sovereignty and the territorial integrity [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=889.56s)]
*  of their motherland. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=895.56s)]
*  And as I said, this brought about more solidarity and it united us further thanks to this act of [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=897.0s)]
*  aggression by the Israeli regime. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=906.04s)]
*  My proposal is that the US administration should refrain from getting involved in a war [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=908.2s)]
*  that is not America's war. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=917.88s)]
*  It is Netanyahu's war that is having its devilish machinations for the whole region. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=922.84s)]
*  It has its own agenda. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=931.48s)]
*  He has his own agenda. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=933.4000000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu, I mean, inhuman agenda, and that is having forever wars, wars that go on and on and on. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=934.68s)]
*  And this is my proposal to the United States not to be fooled by Netanyahu, not to be dragged [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=944.92s)]
*  into this kind of war. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=951.2399999999999s)]
*  Many Americans are afraid of Iran. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  You say you're not afraid, but Americans are afraid of Iran. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=957.88s)]
*  And they believe that Iran would like to strike the United States with a nuclear weapon. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=960.92s)]
*  They see video of Iranians saying, death to America, describing our country as the great Satan. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=965.64s)]
*  What is your opinion of that? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=973.64s)]
*  Should we be afraid of Iran? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=976.36s)]
*  I believe that this is a very wrong impression that anybody might have of Iran or the Iranians. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=978.04s)]
*  I would like to remind you that Iran has never invaded another country in the last 200 years. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=988.04s)]
*  When they say death to the United States, it doesn't mean death to, they don't mean death to the [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=995.9599999999999s)]
*  people of the United States or even to the officials of the United States. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1003.64s)]
*  They mean death to crimes, death to killing and carnage, death to supporting, killing others, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1013.56s)]
*  death to insecurity and instability. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1023.8s)]
*  Have you ever heard that an Iranian killing an American? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1027.72s)]
*  Have you ever heard that? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1033.72s)]
*  Or a terrorist that was Iranian and he carried out a terrorist attack against the Americans? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1035.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it was your president who confessed that the Americans created the ISIS in our region [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1042.4399999999998s)]
*  and they were responsible for this wrong image that is portrayed of religion or the Muslims [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1050.9199999999998s)]
*  in the world. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  Once again, I would like to tell you and remind you that this is not death to the American people [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1062.36s)]
*  or to the officials. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1068.36s)]
*  Death to crimes and atrocities, to bullying, to the use of force. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1069.4799999999998s)]
*  And anybody who would like to become an accomplice in the crimes perpetrated by others. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1075.96s)]
*  Two Iranian ayatollahs have issued fatwas against Donald Trump. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1084.4399999999998s)]
*  What does that mean exactly and what do you think of it? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1090.04s)]
*  To the best of my knowledge, they have not issued decrees or fatwas [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1094.2s)]
*  against any individual or against Donald Trump. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1101.0s)]
*  And first off, it has nothing to do with the Iranian government or to his eminence, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1104.84s)]
*  the supreme leader of Iran or what they actually meant by the fatwa was the [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1112.44s)]
*  in condemnation of an insult to a religion or religious personalities. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1118.2s)]
*  And they were actually saying that this is deplorable, this is unacceptable. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1125.72s)]
*  So it was not directed towards the US president or any other individual. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  And there might be people with their own ideas and opinions, but I can assure you [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1138.28s)]
*  that the meaning of this fatwa should not be construed or considered as a threat against [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1145.0s)]
*  any individual. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1151.96s)]
*  Has Iran ever backed an assassination attempt against Donald Trump? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1153.0s)]
*  This is actually what Netanyahu is trying to insinuate and to make your people or the [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1157.72s)]
*  president of your country to believe. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1166.6s)]
*  But this is wrong because Netanyahu, as I said, has its own agenda. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1169.8799999999999s)]
*  It wants to drag the US into forever wars, as I said, and to bring more insecurity, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1174.6s)]
*  instability and unrest to the whole region. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1181.72s)]
*  There are a number, some large number of Iranian nationals living in the United States. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1185.56s)]
*  Some have said they are, quote, sleeper cells. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1193.16s)]
*  They are terrorists who are acting at the command of your government. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1196.36s)]
*  Would you right now make a statement to Iranian citizens living in the United States [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1201.96s)]
*  not to commit acts of violence in the United States? [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1208.12s)]
*  Thanks for telling me. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1210.8400000000001s)]
*  This is the first time I'm hearing them from you or from anybody. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1214.44s)]
*  Iranians are known for their knowledge, for their science, for their courtesy, for being [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1220.76s)]
*  civilized. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1227.48s)]
*  Have you seen otherwise from them, any other kind of behavior from them or any violent [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1228.2s)]
*  behavior? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1235.72s)]
*  Has anybody ever seen anything from them? [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1236.44s)]
*  As I said, this is what Israel is trying to put into your minds. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1240.52s)]
*  They are propagating that Iranians might be capable of doing the same thing. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1245.8s)]
*  But this is totally untrue because by nature, Iranians are pro-peace and tranquility. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1250.3600000000001s)]
*  They are trying to actually make, to somehow impact the minds of the decision-makers and [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1259.32s)]
*  the people of the United States and to scare them into getting involved in a war in my [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1269.56s)]
*  region that is not going to ensure any kind of interest for the United States. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1278.36s)]
*  It is not to be in the interest of the United States to be involved in any kind of war in [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1285.8799999999999s)]
*  my region. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1292.44s)]
*  It wasn't that long ago, it was during the Revolutionary period in Iran, that Iran had [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1294.6799999999998s)]
*  relations with Israel and commercial relations with Israel and reputedly bought weapons from [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1299.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1303.8s)]
*  What happened? [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1304.68s)]
*  How did that change? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1305.96s)]
*  Who changed it and why that relationship? [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1307.4s)]
*  Israel itself is to blame because just look at what they have been doing in the last couple [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1313.48s)]
*  of years in Palestine, in Gaza, what Netanyahu has been doing, killing women and children, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1320.36s)]
*  bombing schools and hospitals and civilian and residential areas. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1328.6s)]
*  This is nothing short of a full-scale genocide there. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1336.6s)]
*  They have blocked the entry of food and medicine, any kind of humanitarian relief [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1342.76s)]
*  to Gaza. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1349.4s)]
*  So this has adversely impacted the way my country and the whole region looks at Israel. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1351.96s)]
*  Their own behavior and their own actions are to blame because this is unacceptable what [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1364.12s)]
*  they have been doing in my region. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1369.16s)]
*  And as far as I know, we have never received any kind of weapon from Israel. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1371.16s)]
*  And I would like to tell you, even at that time, we did not want to have weapons. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1379.16s)]
*  We did not want to have wars. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1383.4s)]
*  We did not want to fight the Iraqis. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1385.0s)]
*  It was the war that was imposed on us. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1387.48s)]
*  And just like the way that this war was imposed on us by the Israeli regime, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1391.48s)]
*  we did not attack Israel. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1399.5600000000002s)]
*  They attacked us. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1403.0800000000002s)]
*  Can you imagine, at the end of the diplomatic exchange with the United States, a world in which [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1404.8400000000001s)]
*  American companies invest again in Iran, sanctions are lifted, there is peace in the [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1412.6000000000001s)]
*  region? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1419.48s)]
*  Is that your goal? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1419.96s)]
*  And do you think it's possible? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1420.92s)]
*  You know, from the very beginning of my administration, I first tried to have the domestic [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1423.32s)]
*  solidarity and unity, further unity amongst Iranian people. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1432.9199999999998s)]
*  Then we tried to have better relations with our neighboring countries of Iran. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1438.52s)]
*  And then I had this talk with his Eminence, the Supreme Leader of Iran, and during which [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1446.6s)]
*  his Eminence emphasized that there is no limitation and there is nothing preventing [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1453.7199999999998s)]
*  the U.S. investors to come to Iran and to make investments in Iran, even presently. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1460.84s)]
*  And there has never been any limitation, anything barring them from coming into Iran. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1471.32s)]
*  And this is the belief of the Supreme Leader of Iran. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1478.6s)]
*  But once again, I would like to tell you that it is Israel that does not want such things [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1482.68s)]
*  to happen in the region. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1488.44s)]
*  Israel does not want to see peace and tranquility in the region. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1490.6s)]
*  But I would like to once again repeat that the United States President, Mr. Trump, is [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1496.52s)]
*  capable enough to guide the region towards a peace and a brighter future and put Israel [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  in its place, or get into a pit, an endless pit or a swamp. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1511.72s)]
*  And that is a war that Netanyahu wants the United States or the U.S. President to be [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1520.2s)]
*  dragged into. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1526.52s)]
*  So it is up to the United States President to choose which path that I told you about. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1527.72s)]
*  And as I told you, there is nothing preventing the commercial or industrial or economic [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1536.52s)]
*  activities by the U.S. business people and investors. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1545.16s)]
*  And of course, if there was a limitation, it was caused by the U.S. sanctions, not by us. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1551.5600000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, my final question. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1559.48s)]
*  If we wind up in a broader war, could Iran, could you expect assistance from Russia and [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1561.8000000000002s)]
*  China, military and economic assistance from your allies, Russia and China? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1572.6s)]
*  We have always put our trust in God, and in God we trust. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1578.1999999999998s)]
*  And we are capable enough to defend ourselves and to stand on our own two feet and to defend [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1583.32s)]
*  our country, our territorial integrity to the last drop of our blood. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1592.52s)]
*  But as I have said again and again, we don't want wars. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1599.64s)]
*  We don't want to develop a nuclear weapon. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1605.24s)]
*  And this false image, this wrong mentality created in the minds of the U.S. decision [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1609.16s)]
*  makers and officials is because of the devilish machinations instigated by Netanyahu and the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1618.6000000000001s)]
*  Israeli regime and its policies based on war mongering. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1626.68s)]
*  And the U.S. president should know that another war will only spread more instability in the [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1634.6000000000001s)]
*  Middle East, and it is not going to be in the interest or in favor of the U.S. president [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1644.3600000000001s)]
*  or the U.S. government to move in that or towards that direction. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1652.9199999999998s)]
*  They instead need to choose peace and tranquility, which is something that I am and my government [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1659.6399999999999s)]
*  and my country are after. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1668.52s)]
*  And I also, as I said, I believe that the U.S. president is powerful enough to put Israel, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1671.6399999999999s)]
*  to Netanyahu in their place, to contain them and replace the war mongering, bloodshed, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1679.8s)]
*  and conflicts with peace and tranquility. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1687.72s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you for taking the time to explain your perspective. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1690.9199999999998s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1694.6799999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much for providing me with an opportunity to tell you about what is going [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1696.84s)]
*  on in my mind and in my heart. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1703.32s)]
*  And I hope that peace and tranquility will prevail, not just for the people of the United [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1705.64s)]
*  States, for the U.S. officials, but for the whole world and especially the people of my [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1713.88s)]
*  region. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1719.48s)]
*  And thank you again. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYhK2gO3HEM&t=1720.5200000000002s)]
