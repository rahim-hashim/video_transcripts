# Chris Moritz How Kamala Gave California to the Cartels, & the Psychopaths Ruling the Democrat Party
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg)
*  I gotta say it is a little bit astounding to those of us from California to see a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=0.0s)]
*  politician from that state run for president because you in the back of your mind you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7.32s)]
*  You wonder like when someone gonna ask her about the state she's from which is [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=11.56s)]
*  Like the greatest disaster in the history of the United States probably greatest disaster since the fall of Rome [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=16.2s)]
*  I would say went from the greatest place. I think it's fair to say on planet Earth [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Yes, when I grew up in the 70s and 80s 60s 70s and 80s [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=25.36s)]
*  to a place that people are fleeing and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=29.619999999999997s)]
*  so without you know blaming Kamala Harris for all that it's not all her fault, but [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=32.42s)]
*  Someone's have to answer for that [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=36.94s)]
*  You [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=38.94s)]
*  You've just written a book on this bless you for doing that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=58.42s)]
*  Yeah work we're live baby [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=63.3s)]
*  Bernie moment [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=68.94s)]
*  Excuse me so [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=73.06s)]
*  As a San Diegan, I've never forgotten that oh, so what what happened to California? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=75.42s)]
*  Well, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of reasons as to how we ended up in a one-party state [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=81.9s)]
*  how we ended up in a state of decrepitude and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=87.94s)]
*  And frankly with elements of criminality that are so depraved and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=93.54s)]
*  Savage and dark that they are really unseen outside of the worst conflict zones in the world and [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=100.06s)]
*  that is characterized by [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=108.30000000000001s)]
*  Let's say for instance the rise of child soldiers [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=111.5s)]
*  Juveniles committing a lot of crime in fact [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Maybe driving the crime surge in the state and certainly in Los Angeles children [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=118.96s)]
*  Children as young as 10 being recruited by gangs to commit armed robbery hijackings and even murder [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=125.28s)]
*  Okay. So now we're just in Mexico. You're basically just worse than Mexico worse than Mexico. So [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=133.28s)]
*  There are a million authors of this tragedy, but if you were to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=139.48s)]
*  Point to two or three big facts big changes big trends that created [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=144.08s)]
*  The dystopia you're describing what would they be? Well, so there's a legislative angle to this and I think that's a really really important part of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=150.68s)]
*  The the history and the pathway to destruction and that started [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  Well that was influenced by a number of factors principally there was a there was an important Supreme Court case in 2011 called [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=167.72s)]
*  Brown v. Plata and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=175.36s)]
*  In this decision, which was a five-four split Kennedy was the deciding factor on the liberal side wrote the opinion [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=177.88s)]
*  It was determined that the California state prison system was in violation of the eighth amendment [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=185.92s)]
*  Which is cruel unusual punishment and this was only the fact that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=193.0s)]
*  prisons were operating at 200 percent capacity at that time and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=197.8s)]
*  According to this ruling California had to conform to a very arbitrary [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=202.68s)]
*  Capacity ratio or that was established by a federal bureaucracy of [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=210.0s)]
*  137.5 percent [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=217.12s)]
*  So, okay, so if you were at 137.5 percent you were no longer in violation of the eighth amendment [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  so as a result of this ruling California did have to find ways to comply and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=225.48s)]
*  Took a number of steps to do so a number of laws that I'll discuss [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=233.11999999999998s)]
*  but coinciding with [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=237.76s)]
*  with this ruling and going back further is [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  the emergence of the criminal justice reform movement [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=244.2s)]
*  Principally coming out of places like Stanford Law School [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=248.64s)]
*  and some particular individuals like a gentleman named Mike Romano who [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=252.07999999999998s)]
*  Was able to influence the legislature and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=259.28s)]
*  executive level officers in the state to embrace [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=263.64s)]
*  policies that were [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=268.76s)]
*  part of the criminal justice reform movement and principally [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=271.08s)]
*  Dedicated to the idea of reducing the so-called crisis of mass incarceration [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=275.0s)]
*  So this meant that there was a force coming from the Supreme Court that was motivating this and also [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=280.76s)]
*  ideological [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=288.6s)]
*  Activist elements that push for these same reforms at the same time [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=290.88s)]
*  So as the formulation that which I've never thought about till now mass incarceration [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=295.72s)]
*  Which I don't think any normal person would be in favor of mass incarceration, but that's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=302.2s)]
*  You're only describing one side of the coin the other way to describe you the map [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=306.76s)]
*  You know the the crime wave that we're living through that results. I mean that results in people going to prison [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no one thought to address crime. Well, so California had [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=315.44s)]
*  up until let's say [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=321.88s)]
*  2011 [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=324.52s)]
*  one of the most stringent criminal justice systems in the entire country and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=326.08s)]
*  we of course like were the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=331.8s)]
*  The the force behind the three strikes law, yeah and three strikes [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=336.0s)]
*  Put a lot of bad people away for forever [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=341.12s)]
*  But it had problems too to be to be honest like there were there were problems and there were reforms applied to it [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=344.76s)]
*  to reduce, you know potential [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=352.44s)]
*  injustices, right and and I [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=355.56s)]
*  support those but [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=358.64s)]
*  nevertheless three strikes and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=360.68s)]
*  And also the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=364.15999999999997s)]
*  introduction of what are called enhancements [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=366.4s)]
*  So special circumstance enhancements in which let's say you use a gun in a crime [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=368.76s)]
*  You use a gun that adds ten years [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  Additionally to your conviction if you use a gun and you shoot someone that's 20 years [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=378.64s)]
*  If you use a gun and kill someone it's life [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  So that's an enhancement if you're a gang member and engage in you know, whatever crime [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=388.59999999999997s)]
*  Gang enhancements would apply and those would add to the sentencing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=395.88s)]
*  These things were all eliminated and obliterated [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=401.35999999999996s)]
*  in big parts by [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=405.96s)]
*  Directives that came from the sort of so-called source DA's the progressive DA's in 2020 [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=409.12s)]
*  But the dismantling [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=415.11999999999995s)]
*  You know started really [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=417.11999999999995s)]
*  Following this Supreme Court case. So the first law that was a big problem [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=419.4s)]
*  And put us on this path was called AB 109. It's called the Public Safety Realignment Act and [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=426.0s)]
*  the idea was that to reduce the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=436.79999999999995s)]
*  the numbers of prisoners in the state system [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=438.32s)]
*  You would transfer so-called nonviolent [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  non-sexual low-risk offenders to county jails [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=445.04s)]
*  There's a problem though and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=451.08s)]
*  The problem and the sort of poison pill within it was the issue of what classified [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=453.44s)]
*  non-violent [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=459.76s)]
*  non-sexual [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=461.28000000000003s)]
*  low-risk offenders because under AB 109 the only [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=462.64s)]
*  offense [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=468.0s)]
*  Offense that would be considered was the last offense for which you were convicted. So in other words [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=470.08s)]
*  Inmates with long and violent criminal histories [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=480.0s)]
*  Who happened to be in jail in state prison because of a nonviolent offense? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=483.84s)]
*  Were eligible for this system and they were transferred out [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=490.24s)]
*  27,000 [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=494.76s)]
*  It didn't even even with that we still didn't meet the the capacity threshold [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=496.16s)]
*  137.5, but this was one of the steps to do so. Here's the the other thing of building more prisons [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=501.76s)]
*  Well, you know, we don't have the we don't the money California. You can't build a California bankrupt at that time [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=508.88s)]
*  Yeah, right and actually like Jerry Brown to his credit like did did a lot and like earnestly to try and like [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=514.44s)]
*  Straighten the you know, the right the ship of California's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=522.36s)]
*  fiscal situation, but these kinds of policies specific to jailing were [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  totally ill-conceived and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=536.08s)]
*  So with AB 109 all these prisoners get go into county jails [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=538.88s)]
*  But the county jails don't have the resources to write to to house them. They don't have the the funds [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=542.88s)]
*  to staff them and [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  So the outcome is that many are just released into the communities [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=551.52s)]
*  Kamala Harris is elected attorney general in 2010 [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=558.12s)]
*  narrowly beating [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=563.52s)]
*  dick [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=565.12s)]
*  Steve Cooley who was the probably the last great turn district attorney of Los Angeles a Republican by the way [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=566.12s)]
*  He's the only rep. He's the only Republican she's ever run against other than Trump and she lost [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=573.92s)]
*  He lost to her by just a few thousand votes [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=581.4s)]
*  Which I and just this is kind of an interesting coda is that there were also kind of odd circumstances around that election [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=585.68s)]
*  Steve was ahead and then you know kind of in 2020 fashion [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=592.68s)]
*  There was a surge of her votes, but anyway, she's elected to California attorney general in 2010 and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=598.68s)]
*  her first [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=605.7199999999999s)]
*  big task is [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=607.24s)]
*  Administering AB 109 because as the head of the California Justice Department [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=609.36s)]
*  She really has the most [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=615.52s)]
*  you know [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=618.84s)]

*  What everyone was warning her including the California District Attorneys Association? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=628.52s)]
*  Police unions at this law was going to be a big problem [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=635.12s)]
*  She supported it. She did nothing to try and like [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=640.2s)]
*  Bring more resources to these county jails and this is a theme actually we'll see over and over again in California [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=644.0s)]
*  Where the state has some failure some bureaucratic? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=650.4s)]
*  You know [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=656.28s)]
*  Incompetency or shortfall in the budget or some issue and the and the the the [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=657.8s)]
*  Strategy at Sacramento is to simply move that problem shifted to [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=665.56s)]
*  Localities to counties to manage which are also struggling [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=671.24s)]
*  So it's kind of robbing Peter to pay Paul and nothing changes [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=675.16s)]
*  So after a B 109 went to effect the next year property crimes went up 9% [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=679.84s)]
*  and [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=686.72s)]
*  moreover [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=688.76s)]
*  61% of those offenders who were eligible for this program and by the way, it's retroactive [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=691.28s)]
*  61% are arrested within a year and [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=698.96s)]
*  41% are convicted [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=704.76s)]
*  again, so [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  clearly the recidivism rate [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=709.4s)]
*  Created by this law was a major problem [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=712.48s)]
*  fast forward to 2014 and [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=716.04s)]
*  The worst of them all comes out of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=718.76s)]
*  Strategy political strategy consultant firms in San Francisco who by the way backed Kamala Harris and to great great extent [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=723.76s)]
*  And this is called prop 47. Yes, so prop 47 was [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  Marketed to [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=740.8399999999999s)]
*  Californians and I should say for you know, people don't understand California politics [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=742.72s)]
*  We have this [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=746.72s)]
*  You know a system that allows for you know, really important legislation to be put forward directly to the voters [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=748.64s)]
*  and [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=755.4399999999999s)]
*  That's how a lot of very very big laws in California have like the initiative system [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=757.88s)]
*  Yeah, like prop 13 exactly and prop 27 [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=762.84s)]
*  Exactly, we can talk about but [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=766.68s)]
*  Prop 40 excuse me prop 47 [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=769.48s)]
*  This was the stealing [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=773.52s)]
*  Legalization it's called it was called just ever, you know euphemistically the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=775.56s)]
*  safe neighborhoods and schools act [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=782.04s)]
*  And the idea behind it was we would redo again address the mass incarceration problem [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=785.92s)]
*  reduce the prison capacity by shifting [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=792.6s)]
*  again non-violent offenders [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=797.6s)]
*  You know out of state prisons and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=800.12s)]
*  treating [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=803.44s)]
*  thefts under [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=804.88s)]
*  nine hundred and fifty dollars as misdemeanors prior to this law [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=807.2s)]
*  thefts at four hundred dollars would be felony grand larceny and [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=811.36s)]
*  This law changed it such that it would have to be above nine hundred and fifty dollars to become a felony [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=817.6800000000001s)]
*  so [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=823.2s)]
*  As as a consequence of this. Oh there was also [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=824.48s)]
*  Oh there was also as a as another [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=828.16s)]
*  Another factor of prop 47 was that drug possession [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=831.5999999999999s)]
*  would [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=836.8s)]
*  Would not would no longer be a a felony it would be treated as a misdemeanor [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=838.3199999999999s)]
*  And this has also exacerbated the drug and homeless problem [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=844.56s)]
*  In fact, I think in the years after right after prop 47 went into effect the number of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=848.56s)]
*  Er overdose cases was up 25 percent. So this is the law that legalized stealing and drug use correct effective [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=855.76s)]
*  Yes, so I remember this very well and I think I remember rob reiner [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=862.48s)]
*  It was an enemy of civilization being one of the many celebrity backers of this, but it was quite [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=867.68s)]
*  Popular. I mean like a lot of famous people were behind this. Oh, yeah. Well, come on kamala harris [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=873.76s)]
*  wrote the [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=879.12s)]
*  Law that appeared on the ballot and kamala harris did yes because in california the attorney general of the state [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=880.64s)]
*  Will write the language and the title for every proposition put before harris is the one who wrote the legalized stealing act [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=888.16s)]
*  Yes [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=895.28s)]
*  And I will tell you steve coulee calls it fraud by misrepresentation and there is a poison pill within prop 47 [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=895.68s)]
*  That is quite shocking and she was actually called out for it by the sacramento b [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=903.68s)]
*  And that is that these reclassified offenders would no longer be subject [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=908.88s)]
*  To mandatory and standard dna testing [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=916.56s)]
*  as a result [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=920.7199999999999s)]
*  dna testing for across the state went from [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=922.16s)]
*  15,000 a month to 5,000 a month and dna testing is super super critical [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=926.14s)]
*  for the [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=933.04s)]
*  solving of cold case homicides rapes [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=934.48s)]
*  and other violent crimes that you know are typically um [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=938.08s)]
*  Associated with people with track records of crime. So these non-violent, you know, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  larceny type offenders [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=949.36s)]
*  Are you know are very likely or you know, or at least you know, it should be investigated whether they have [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=952.1600000000001s)]
*  Um some kind of connection to other crimes as we've seen, you know everywhere. Um [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=959.2800000000001s)]
*  So a small number of people commit the overwhelming majority of crime exactly every society so camela harris's [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=964.8s)]
*  description in the ballot [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=970.86s)]
*  uh for 47 [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=972.72s)]
*  basically [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=974.96s)]
*  obfuscated [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=976.06s)]
*  This issue of the dna testing and the sacramento b called her out on it and said that this was [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=977.04s)]
*  effectively a [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=983.36s)]
*  misrepresentation and a failure on her part to omit this information from the voters [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=985.28s)]
*  or the authors of this are [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=990.56s)]
*  Like taking the side of rapists over the population. Oh, yeah, and and well i'll tell you also, uh [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=993.4399999999999s)]
*  She was not alone in writing this the the language. I mean camela harris doesn't do anything, right? She does she she's a [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1000.8s)]
*  Facilitator, uh and an opportunist and everything every action really she has taken in california [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1009.18s)]
*  Has been on the basis of what is good for camela harris, right? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1015.8399999999999s)]
*  But what I have heard from from my sources [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1018.7199999999999s)]
*  Who are certainly would know with prop 47 it was significantly influenced in terms of the language [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1022.56s)]
*  by um prominent figures from the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1030.24s)]
*  criminal justice reform movement [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1033.44s)]

*  entities affiliated with george soros who's always been a funder of criminal justice reform so they sold this as [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1037.44s)]
*  Like good for the california budget good for the safety of your neighborhood [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1045.04s)]
*  Sort of the opposite of the truth well literally the opposite of the truth [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  And people bought it. What what was the margin on 60 percent? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1053.6799999999998s)]
*  60 percent. Yes [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1057.12s)]
*  Committed civilizational suicide without knowing it. Yes, they we sowed our own demise. Yes, and we did so because our leaders [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1059.4399999999998s)]
*  manipulate language [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1069.34s)]
*  Nonviolent offender for instance is not nonviolent offender [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1071.52s)]
*  Um, in fact in the next law that came about that was again on our pathway to destruction prop [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1076.42s)]
*  57 which passed in 2016 [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1083.44s)]
*  That law again, which camala harris, uh wrote the language for [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1087.06s)]
*  and which she was [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1091.94s)]
*  excoriated by uh other democrats when she was running for um higher office, particularly loretta sanchez [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1093.62s)]
*  prop 57 [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1100.98s)]
*  Uh was again to address mass incarceration [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1102.82s)]
*  and would offer additional parole opportunities [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1106.98s)]
*  For offenders that were deemed to be quote nonviolent [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1111.46s)]
*  but [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1116.34s)]
*  What is nonviolent under proper 57? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1117.3s)]
*  It is anything that is not one of 23 specific crimes that is in a obscure section of the penal code [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1120.26s)]
*  so nonviolent could be [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1128.26s)]
*  Drug trafficking human trafficking rape by intoxication some forms of assault [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1130.9s)]
*  Financial crimes [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1138.58s)]
*  serious financial crimes [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1140.26s)]
*  um, and [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1142.26s)]
*  basically, uh these these offenders under this provision would uh would have opportunities for parole and also parole [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1143.46s)]
*  uh administration [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1153.12s)]
*  Would was also passed down to the county levels who again didn't have the resources to handle this new, um, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1155.06s)]
*  burden [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1163.8600000000001s)]
*  So there's a [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1166.42s)]
*  Striking example of this was a ballot initiative also ballot initiative also passed [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1168.1s)]
*  Again, I think by pretty good margin [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1172.9s)]
*  And not as not as famous, uh infamous as as 47 but you know, very destructive [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1175.7s)]
*  There's a case of a of a offender release under this um, who went on to uh, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1182.92s)]
*  Uh kill like four or five people in a mass shooting gang related [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1191.48s)]
*  um, like within two years of get of release because of course when they go into the parole system, um, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1196.6s)]
*  The parole system is is completely incompetent at the local levels they again they do not have the resources [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1206.12s)]
*  um, and there was a participation rate of offenders of nine percent in [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1212.6s)]
*  Rehabilitation programs and the idea in the cornerstone of 57 was we are taking these you know [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1217.78s)]
*  people that you know, they they are nonviolent and they can be redeemed right, but [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1224.2s)]
*  It's really just a gimmick. Um [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1230.2s)]
*  that is driven by [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1232.76s)]
*  again this [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1234.76s)]
*  This this mandate by the supreme court but also by the influence of criminal justice reform advocates [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1236.2s)]
*  natural disasters [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1243.8s)]
*  wars political conflicts the recent threatened [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1245.8s)]
*  Dock worker strikes at ports around the country all of these are reminders [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1249.64s)]
*  That things that we take for granted in this country like medicine are all dependent on a long and fragile supply chain [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1254.68s)]
*  If something happens to that supply chain you and your family will not be able to get things that you need to live [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1263.16s)]
*  So right now seems like a pretty good time to stock up on essentials for when the next unexpected disaster hits [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1271.4s)]
*  Because it's coming we know that [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1278.44s)]

*  So the jace case is a personalized emergency medication kit that contains essential antibiotics and medications to treat the most common [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1297.8s)]
*  and potentially deadly [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1305.32s)]
*  bacterial infections for example [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1307.1399999999999s)]
*  And then a whole host of add-on medicines from ivermectin to epipens depending on what you and your family may need [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
*  How hard is it to get this not hard? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1315.8s)]
*  The process is quick and easy you fill out an online form [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1318.04s)]
*  You consult with their physician and you receive your medications through a licensed pharmacy at a fraction of the regular price [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1321.24s)]
*  It is all totally above board completely legit and in the case of a disruption to our supply chain [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1328.36s)]
*  Which again could very easily happen [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1333.8s)]
*  It could mean the difference between surviving and not so we recommend it go to jace.com use code tucker at checkout for a discount [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1335.8s)]

*  Dot com promo code tucker. So now is the time to get to motive. What would be the motive of a so-called? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1346.2s)]
*  criminal justice reformer [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1354.44s)]
*  of george soros [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1356.84s)]
*  Kamala harris's motives are always political so we already answer that question but but of the [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1358.28s)]
*  Of the sincere believers in this stuff the idea that the criminals are the real victims free them stealing should be legal etc. Etc [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1362.28s)]
*  like why [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1369.16s)]
*  What's driving them? Well, I think there's there's [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1370.76s)]
*  There are those who are pushed for these initiatives [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1374.52s)]
*  Who are just pure sociopaths and they are not really committed ideologically they they they galvanize around it because [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1377.8799999999999s)]
*  It's in vogue and it allows them access to money like soros money george gascon is probably the greatest example of this [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1385.24s)]
*  Not an ideologue ideologue by the way [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1394.2s)]
*  A very bad stupid lawyer from what everyone says but not an ideologue [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  Associopath is how he's been described to me as have some of these other rogue prosecutors, but then there's the true believers [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1402.52s)]
*  And within criminal justice reform, I think that it's fair to say there's a spectrum [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1409.6399999999999s)]
*  of of [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1414.9199999999998s)]
*  radicalism, you know some initiatives I I think [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1416.74s)]
*  uh [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1421.24s)]
*  Have like good intentions [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1422.2s)]
*  um, you know, we we do want rehabilitation in society we do want [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1424.44s)]
*  Um the opportunity to um [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1429.88s)]
*  Build your one's life back by a bad choice like that's like that's a christian value, of course, but [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1433.4s)]
*  It goes much much deeper than that [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1440.44s)]
*  And I think that as you as you peel back the layers of criminal justice reform and look at what they're specifically advocating for [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1442.52s)]
*  um [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1449.72s)]
*  It ranges not only from mass [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1450.68s)]
*  uh incarceration [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1453.22s)]
*  solutions but also [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1455.64s)]
*  Uh, frankly defunding the police [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1457.8000000000002s)]
*  um, uh [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1460.76s)]
*  uh pacifying the police through you know [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1462.26s)]
*  ideas like community policing in which police are [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1466.0400000000002s)]
*  Sort of characterized now as social workers rather than in law enforcement [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1469.4s)]
*  Them turning of course emasculating well literally emasculating. Yeah, literally [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1474.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean women now make a huge portion of overall cops [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1478.44s)]
*  and you know, there's [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1483.0s)]
*  The cops i've talked to who who are like [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1485.4s)]
*  you know, uh [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1488.68s)]
*  Serious serious like threatening figures, but but good guys they they see the the police today is an absolute joke [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1490.18s)]
*  And I can tell you [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1498.44s)]
*  Uh, and i'll i'll get into it about how bad it's getting at at the lappd and other law enforcement agencies [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1499.88s)]
*  But through erosion because of these policies and morale [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1506.36s)]
*  Erosion, but back to criminal justice reform. I think that it's really important [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1509.96s)]
*  to strip away euphemisms [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1515.0s)]
*  And if when when I was evaluating, um [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1518.2s)]
*  You know the the tenets of this [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1522.04s)]
*  of this movement [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1524.92s)]
*  It became apparent to me that [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1526.44s)]
*  Not only did it place the offender above victim [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1528.92s)]
*  It it [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1535.24s)]
*  fundamentally [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1537.04s)]
*  Resulted in [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1539.04s)]
*  The the diffusion of crime and the spreading of suffering as a policy choice [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1541.6s)]
*  So as laws like so trying to wreck [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1549.6s)]
*  Other people's neighborhoods safe neighborhoods affluent neighborhoods white neighborhoods, correct with crime on purpose [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1553.12s)]
*  Because they were orderly affluent and white that's right and I can tell you like for instance [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1559.44s)]
*  The uh, so that's not a figment of the imagination. That's a that's an actual choice you think well [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1566.1599999999999s)]
*  I can for sure blm activists say that stealing mass stealing of retail stores [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1571.04s)]
*  Uh is a form of reparation. This is [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1577.84s)]
*  Crime, I call this crime equity. Um this concept [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1581.12s)]
*  Um, and I it's not even something said like in jest or or flippantly. Um, it's actually a very deep [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1585.52s)]
*  and dark [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1593.2s)]
*  idea with historical analogs, um, I think particularly uh, uh, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1594.6399999999999s)]
*  Pertinent would be what happened in radija [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1600.48s)]
*  Where criminals are released from prisons in mass and sent on, uh, essentially government [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1604.24s)]
*  sanctioned theft of [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1611.18s)]
*  uh white farmer land and other property and this is a form of [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1613.92s)]
*  You know kind of anarchic tyranny, right? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1620.0s)]
*  so this is crime as [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1624.5600000000002s)]
*  A means of totalitarian control and as a tool [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1628.24s)]
*  Of racial grievance. It is a it is a crime as a means [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1633.92s)]
*  to redress [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1638.16s)]
*  Historical grievances through collective punishment [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1640.22s)]
*  So we're mad about what your ancestors did. So we hope your daughter gets raped, correct? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1643.84s)]
*  Yeah, that's about as evil as it gets. Yeah, and I will give you some example [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1648.6399999999999s)]

*  Oh, that's really scary [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1754.08s)]
*  Well, I mean this is this is who gascon has surrounded himself with so tiffany blacknell's a great example [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1756.1599999999999s)]
*  Of like a true believer gascon [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1761.9199999999998s)]
*  No, he's too stupid to be a believer like kamala harris [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1764.7199999999998s)]
*  I find it very ridiculous when people say kamala harris is a bulshavik because to be a bulshavik [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1768.64s)]
*  You actually have to know about philosophy you have to know about dialectics [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1773.12s)]
*  She just to make it through das capitale [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1777.28s)]
*  Kamala harris only knows kamala harris, although she doesn't even know that because we can't figure out what her name is [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1779.76s)]
*  She's a child. Obviously. She's a tool. Um of greater power [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1785.36s)]
*  Obviously, I mean she went up there by accident because of her skin color [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1789.26s)]
*  So the laws continue to get worse from there [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1792.16s)]
*  And in 2020 that was the catalyst so the george floyd but just to be guys want to linger on this for one second [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1795.28s)]
*  Just to be clear you believe [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1802.32s)]
*  That crime is not an accident crime as a result of intentional policy crime is the point of the policy [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1804.64s)]
*  And part of the aim is to punish people for their skin color with crime. Of course [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1810.64s)]
*  Um, well not of course, that's the sickest thing i've heard this year. Well, it it's extremely evil [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1816.48s)]
*  and it is um [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1822.4s)]
*  It is demonstrably the case because these laws were so [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1823.84s)]
*  they they were [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1828.6399999999999s)]
*  So obviously negligent and reckless [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1830.6399999999999s)]
*  Everyone knew all the law enforcement agencies all the district attorneys [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1834.6399999999999s)]
*  Came out against these kinds of initiatives [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1839.6s)]
*  Saying that these the result is going to be dangerous criminals on the street [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1842.72s)]
*  Dangerous criminals on the street. This is our future and they pass it [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1847.6799999999998s)]
*  Anyway, the voters passed it kamala harris wrote the language [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1851.92s)]
*  Uh, you know and again prop 47 is called the safe schools and neighborhoods act [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1856.96s)]
*  Right. So the idea is that the funding say budget savings from moving, uh for not, uh [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1862.8000000000002s)]
*  classifying these larcenies as [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1869.8200000000002s)]
*  felonies [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1872.64s)]
*  uh and and and [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1873.76s)]
*  Thereby being misdemeanors which are not ever ever in force or prosecuted [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1876.0800000000002s)]
*  Um what would save millions of dollars that would then be redirected to schools? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1881.3s)]
*  Well, did the schools get great in california the schools are worse than ever. Um, are the neighborhoods safer? [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1886.1s)]
*  uh [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1892.1s)]
*  No, of course not like the the la is as as [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1893.22s)]
*  La is not as quite as violent as it was [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1898.66s)]
*  Um during the 1990s, which was at the peak of the the drug war between the bloods and the crypts [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1901.78s)]
*  however [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1908.34s)]
*  We're getting there and the difference between now and then is that back then? [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1909.54s)]
*  Gangsters were killing each other. They were killing each other [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1915.92s)]
*  for [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1919.3s)]
*  Uh, you know who owned what street corner to sell drugs, right? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1920.34s)]
*  Now the violence is turned against all of us [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1925.3s)]
*  The taxpayers the people who created the society and sustain it right with their labor [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1929.06s)]
*  Yeah, so that's that is how I sort of because the the gangs did not create [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1933.86s)]
*  Los angeles or the united states or anything of value in this country at all they create nothing [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1938.98s)]
*  They only destroy just to be clear [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1943.3799999999999s)]
*  And so while all of us are equal in the eyes of god and all of us are equal as american citizens [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1945.54s)]
*  We're not all equal in our effects [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1950.6599999999999s)]
*  Some of us are creators and others are destroyers and you're saying that the destroyers are now killing the creators [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1951.9399999999998s)]
*  I'm saying that destroyers run california [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1957.6999999999998s)]
*  man [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1961.1399999999999s)]
*  And I can tell you [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1962.6599999999999s)]
*  That's not hyperbole [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1964.5s)]
*  Um and [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1967.06s)]
*  Really in many ways california is actually under the sovereignty of the mexican drug cartels and this happened [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1969.86s)]
*  Primarily, um california is under the sovereignty of the mexican sovereignty [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1979.36s)]
*  sovereignty is this idea that a [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1984.0s)]
*  one power exerts influence on another [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1987.22s)]
*  um and allows some autonomy of the [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1990.98s)]
*  Subordinate power, um, it's often been used in like geopolitical analysis to like for instance describe how rome [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=1994.5s)]
*  roman empire administered um gall right exactly. Yeah, so so there's a semblance of autonomy [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2002.5s)]
*  But there is still ultimately a power that is answered to and the reason that the mexican drug cartels [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2010.66s)]
*  I think qualify for that [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2017.06s)]
*  is because sometime around [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2019.3799999999999s)]
*  2010 [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2021.44s)]
*  all this bad stuff happened 2010 and if I may even say like [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2023.22s)]
*  You know when we last spoke about the trans issue that also really got into effect in 2010 [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2027.94s)]
*  It's peak obamaism is what it is [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2034.42s)]
*  But in any event so I think in retrospect we can say that obama was a destroyer that the intent was to [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2037.5400000000002s)]
*  Subvert and destroy the united states and that some people called that early. They were derided as crazy or racist [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2042.8200000000002s)]
*  They weren't either one of those things they were prescient. I always took him completely deadly serious [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2048.82s)]
*  When he said he was going to change america [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2054.02s)]
*  And he did yes, maybe forever [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2056.7400000000002s)]
*  but um [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2060.1800000000003s)]
*  in any event around 2010 [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2061.54s)]
*  There was a hostile takeover of the narcotics distribution [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2065.6200000000003s)]
*  Market in california [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2071.78s)]
*  Which had been otherwise the domain of black gangs native-born black people legacy black gangs had run [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2074.1800000000003s)]
*  Narcotics and dope trading. Can I just say at least you know, even if they're drug dealers or gang members, they're still americans [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2082.0s)]
*  Oh, and let me tell you share a common history and actually actually [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2087.94s)]
*  they're [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2092.1000000000004s)]
*  They have they have principles [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2093.6200000000003s)]
*  That's kind of the point I was making at least at least they're part of this country for sure [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2096.26s)]
*  I'll tell you in a minute how principled they are. Maybe we even agree with them on some things [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2100.18s)]
*  Because I suspect we're voting the same way this november just throwing that out there. Well [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2106.1s)]
*  So when the cartels when the cartels moved into california, they said to all the black gangs [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2110.8199999999997s)]
*  If you sell dope without our permission, we will quote cut your head off and they meant that literally [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2116.9s)]
*  They meant that literally so every black gang [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2123.22s)]
*  Had to then find an alternative revenue stream or get their dope supply from the drug from the cartels from hispanic gangs because all [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2126.2599999999998s)]
*  hispanic gangs in california kind of operate as a as a [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2134.1s)]
*  Extension of of gangs above them, which is [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2139.94s)]
*  Which are based in prison and that's another issue [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2145.06s)]
*  but [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2148.66s)]
*  The you know the the highest level gang in california is called the mexican mafia and it's a prison [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2149.94s)]
*  It's a prison gang, but this and this gang [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2155.62s)]
*  Is the ultimate authority really on all? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2158.98s)]
*  latino gangs in the state [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2162.34s)]
*  There are two to three hundred thousand gang members in california [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2165.06s)]
*  63 300 000. Yes, uh the for for reference the u.s national guard has 250 000 members [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2169.2000000000003s)]
*  There's 1.2 million gang members in the united states [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2178.1800000000003s)]
*  And in california 63 that's bigger than the active duty u.s military. Yeah [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2181.86s)]
*  Thanks, I think so [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2187.54s)]
*  Um, oh wow and uh 63 percent are latino so as a result of this [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2190.34s)]
*  Volume, uh and numerical advantage they control the prisons [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2198.02s)]
*  So the mexican mafia which is actually like, uh, you know a legacy organization it has a long history [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2202.58s)]
*  Oh a long history 50 years anyway, yeah, um, and they are incredibly powerful [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2208.7400000000002s)]
*  Um, and and as as it was told to me by um this incredible [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2214.82s)]
*  um la county sheriff [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2219.86s)]
*  uh sergeant, uh who and i'm not going to mention the names of any of my sources, um for their protection and safety but [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2222.26s)]
*  Uh, this gentleman, um [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2230.5s)]
*  Said to me that uh, he was head of major crimes bureau for the la county sheriffs and [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2233.6200000000003s)]
*  25 year veteran of the force now in private security [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2239.52s)]
*  and he said to me that [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2243.78s)]
*  The prisons ruled the street [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2246.02s)]
*  so effectively [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2248.7400000000002s)]
*  the criminal economy of california which is in the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2250.26s)]
*  Tens of billions maybe a hundred billion [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2254.7400000000002s)]
*  Mexican [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2257.14s)]
*  Passes through california state prisons [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2259.3799999999997s)]
*  so [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2263.7799999999997s)]
*  That is a prima facie indictment of the failure of our prisons because from prison the mexican mafia is [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2265.22s)]
*  ordering hits running drug trades [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2273.46s)]
*  human trafficking you name it and they do so as proxies of [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2276.74s)]
*  The mexican drug cartels in mexico. Yes [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2283.22s)]
*  So this is well, they're not in mexico. They they're in california, but this is exactly what destroyed al salvador [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2287.7s)]
*  and has wrecked mexico and guatemala is [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2293.2999999999997s)]
*  drug gangs operating their leaders operating from prison with impunity with impunity [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2296.66s)]
*  So let's ask you to side note because I can't resist so in those in mexico guatemala and salvador and probably other countries as well [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2302.18s)]
*  the drug gangs are [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2308.58s)]
*  Effectively religious organizations based on satanism. Oh, absolutely. Is that true in california as well? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2310.64s)]
*  um, well I will tell you that the the law enforcement and prosecutors that I talked to would say that [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2316.1800000000003s)]
*  The illegal alien gang element is characterized by extreme violence, right? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2322.6600000000003s)]
*  Like extreme like like isis violence, right? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2328.5800000000004s)]
*  Unnecessary violence not just shooting people to death as the black gangs historically. There's a lot of reasons for that [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2332.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean I in my [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2337.1400000000003s)]
*  in my research, um, I couldn't help but sort of [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2339.1400000000003s)]
*  Trace like the anthropological and historical [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2342.82s)]
*  Basis for this extreme violence and we're back to the aztecs, aren't we? Well, of course, yeah, of course, because [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2346.66s)]
*  You have to consider the fact that we've seen so-called narco terrorist narco empires [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2353.7000000000003s)]
*  Many many times since the 70s. Yeah [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2360.66s)]
*  and yeah, they killed a lot of people but they shot them or they use car bombs or [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2363.86s)]
*  basic kind of [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2370.1s)]
*  mafia style hits [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2371.78s)]
*  And that is also the case for the italian mafia the genovese sold heroin [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2374.1800000000003s)]
*  They didn't behead anyone and that's the case for the triads exactly. It's the case for the russians even [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2378.42s)]
*  Yes, but in mexico and in central america [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2384.82s)]
*  What we see is what I call cultural atavism [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2388.6600000000003s)]
*  and it's the notion that there are certain [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2393.2200000000003s)]
*  cultural traits and [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2396.5s)]

*  practices [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2400.02s)]
*  That survive the generations and are amalgamated into a new society and mexico is a very I mean [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2401.38s)]
*  It's a wonderful place in many many ways. I agree. I love it [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2407.7s)]
*  but [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2412.18s)]
*  It is a fusion of indigenous [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2413.38s)]
*  uh, you know indigenous people [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2416.74s)]
*  and [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2419.38s)]
*  Spanish catholic and european right and many of those traits [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2420.34s)]
*  Um [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2425.3799999999997s)]
*  from that survived the aztec period and I will tell you the the level of brutality of the aztecs is [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2426.58s)]
*  Is beyond belief. Um, yes, they killed 200 000 people a year [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2434.58s)]
*  At least the sacrifice the aztecs were so committed to human sacrifice and not just sacrifice [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2439.62s)]
*  But the but the torture of living people unto death and children by the way, of course [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2445.06s)]
*  And and not just the aztecs but the maya and the inca also [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2450.1000000000004s)]
*  That it does in the end as much as you sort of hate the conquistadors because they were brutal and all that you root for [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2453.7000000000003s)]
*  The conquistadors with everything you have of course. I will tell you [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2458.98s)]
*  the aztecs, uh worshiped a lightning and rain god called tlaloc and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2462.5800000000004s)]
*  when there were droughts they would [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2469.0600000000004s)]
*  um [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2471.7000000000003s)]
*  They would sacrifice their children and they believed that the tears of their children on the as they walked [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2472.7400000000002s)]
*  Up the steps of the pyramid to have their hearts ripped out [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2479.3s)]
*  Would be taken by the gods and transformed [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2483.2200000000003s)]
*  transmogrified into rain [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2487.36s)]
*  Yeah [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2491.94s)]
*  So this is the culture you see this with within some native american cultures in north america as well where it's not simply a matter of [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2492.9s)]
*  Killing people but of prolonging their suffering. Yes as an offering to to the spirit world [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2499.54s)]
*  Well the the so there's not a guess by the way [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2505.2200000000003s)]
*  so the cartels emerge from this from this kind of amalgamation culture and [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2508.1000000000004s)]
*  um, they they have altars they have altars of [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2513.06s)]
*  With human skulls and other kind of icons that are indigenous to metro america [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2517.2200000000003s)]
*  Um, there's even a cartel, uh icon or idol. I should say called santa muerte, which is um, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2523.7000000000003s)]
*  You know you see on a lot of cartel, uh tattoos and so forth [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2531.1400000000003s)]
*  um, and uh, you know ms 13 is even more demonic [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2535.1400000000003s)]
*  Although that was born in california in los angeles. Yes, by the way like it came from los angeles [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2540.42s)]
*  Central salvador and destroyed el salvador exactly [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2545.94s)]
*  So but witchcraft is at the heart of this and I don't think that's incidental. It's not animism. Yeah, that's right or exactly [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2549.2200000000003s)]
*  But it's a religious cult as well as a business organization [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2557.06s)]
*  Exactly and and that's why I feel it's so critical to understand this dynamic [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2561.06s)]
*  It's not just a historically interesting facet [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2565.06s)]
*  But the fact is that we have brought in [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2568.26s)]
*  um [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2571.54s)]
*  millions 12 million [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2572.5s)]
*  Migrants many of them coming from this this triangle right in central america [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2574.6600000000003s)]
*  And it's really important to understand [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2580.7400000000002s)]
*  um [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2583.78s)]
*  What who are these people? [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2585.62s)]
*  And especially let's say the two million gotaways [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2588.1s)]
*  Which is often cited as the pure criminal element amongst the the migrant in invasion [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2592.74s)]
*  uh, and um [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2599.46s)]
*  Because uh, there was all migrants, you know that are looking for economic [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2600.98s)]
*  Benefits or whatever they turn themselves into ice and tom homen told me this directly [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2605.8599999999997s)]
*  They turn themselves into ice and under the biden administration ice as homen put it has been reduced to [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2610.9s)]
*  Instead of enforcement, um changing diapers and making sandwiches [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2617.7799999999997s)]
*  um, but for those two million that evade ice [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2621.94s)]
*  They are doing so so that they are not put into the system and they are pure gangsters [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2626.98s)]
*  and they're coming from [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2632.8199999999997s)]
*  cultures that [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2635.2999999999997s)]
*  display [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2636.98s)]
*  um heads on bridges and skin people alive [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2638.2599999999998s)]
*  and boil people in acid and um, this is [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2643.06s)]
*  Part of their sport and it's and it is it is seeping into california [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2647.62s)]
*  We've traveled to an awful lot of countries on this show to some free countries the dwindling number and a lot of not very [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2653.62s)]
*  Free countries places famous for government censorship and wherever we go [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2660.18s)]
*  We use a virtual private network of vpn and we use express vpn [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2664.5s)]
*  We do it to access the free and open internet [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2670.2599999999998s)]
*  But the interesting thing is when we come back here to the united states we still use express vpn why [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2674.6600000000003s)]
*  Big tech surveillance. It's everywhere. It's not just north korea that monitors every move its citizens make no [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2680.42s)]
*  That same thing happens right here in the united states and in canada and great britain and around the world [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2687.94s)]
*  Internet providers can see every website you visit. Did you know that? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2693.6200000000003s)]
*  They may even be required to keep your browsing history on file for years and then turn over to federal authorities if asked [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2698.1s)]
*  In the united states internet providers are legally allowed to and regularly do sell your browsing history everywhere you go online [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2705.54s)]
*  There is no privacy. Did you know that? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2712.82s)]
*  Well, we did and that's why we use express vpn and because we do our internet provider never knows where we're going on the internet [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2715.7s)]
*  They never hear it in the first place [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2723.06s)]
*  That's because a hundred percent of our online activity is routed through express vpn's secure encrypted servers [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2724.9s)]
*  They hide our ip address so data brokers cannot track us and sell our online activity on the black market. We have privacy [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2732.1s)]
*  Express vpn lets you connect to servers in a hundred and five different countries [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2740.34s)]
*  So basically you can go online like you're anywhere in the world. No one can see you [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2745.2200000000003s)]
*  This was the promise of the internet in the first place privacy and freedom [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2750.02s)]
*  those didn't seem like [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2755.14s)]
*  They were achievable, but now they are express vpn. We cannot recommend it enough [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2756.9s)]
*  It's also really easy to use whether or not you fully understand the technology behind it. You can use it on your phone [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2761.46s)]
*  Laptop tablet even your smart tvs you press one button just tap it and you're protected you have privacy [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2767.62s)]

*  Amazing now there's another factor of this so it displaced so black crime [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2817.7s)]
*  Where people fretted about for years is like not a thing anymore. No, it went somewhere else [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2822.2599999999998s)]
*  They had to find other alternative revenue stream to the verticals and what what was the [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2827.86s)]
*  What was the safest alternative and also highly lucrative? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2832.98s)]
*  residential burglaries and retail theft [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2836.8s)]
*  So all of the retail theft that you see that we see in in the media of these [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2839.54s)]
*  You know nordstrom's being right looted. Yeah by hordes of of thieves [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2844.34s)]
*  that's not just like [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2849.86s)]
*  incidental [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2852.0s)]
*  individual acts of like larceny right that is all organized by gangs and [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2853.36s)]
*  The market for the the resale the fencing is called for in california [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2860.2599999999998s)]
*  Maybe just even los angeles [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2866.66s)]
*  Is like 10 billion dollars [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2869.2999999999997s)]
*  Nationwide retail thefts [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2872.48s)]
*  Are 100 billion dollars [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2875.8599999999997s)]
*  Where's it resold? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2878.3399999999997s)]
*  It's resold. Um through fencers. Um, and ebay. Yeah ebay. It's uh, you know like [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2880.18s)]
*  uh pawn shops like uh, but I think primarily on the internet, um, or to you know, even perhaps other companies [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2888.18s)]
*  For you know, it's go it's a it's a it's it passes through multiple layers, right and um, you know, so these fencing operations [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2896.2599999999998s)]
*  Are extremely lucrative [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2905.14s)]
*  um, so so there's that angle to it and [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2907.7799999999997s)]
*  It's resulted in the emergence of trends within these kinds of uh burglaries [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2911.54s)]
*  um called flocking or jugging [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2917.8599999999997s)]
*  Or knock knock burglaries or follow home burglaries and basically it it's uh, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2921.16s)]
*  You know flocking is a term that refers to [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2928.2000000000003s)]
*  Penetrating like a safe neighborhood blending into that neighborhood [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2935.2200000000003s)]
*  targeting a particular [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2940.12s)]
*  person that they've perhaps [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2942.12s)]
*  um [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2944.84s)]
*  uh through social media identified as potentially wealthy and [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2946.04s)]
*  Then going on missions into these neighborhoods [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2950.36s)]
*  To to rob them tie them up home invasions, whatever [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2954.1200000000003s)]
*  But what's quite interesting is that there are some gangs [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2958.92s)]
*  That have become so good at it that they now actually act as consultants to other gangs to teach them how to flock [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2962.44s)]
*  So what does that look like from the victim's perspective? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2970.84s)]
*  Well, it could look like getting tied up [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2973.48s)]
*  It could look like you you're not home and everything's you come home and everything's gone [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2975.48s)]

*  A knock knock burglary, uh is just like what it sounds like [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2981.1600000000003s)]
*  Uh criminals will uh, you know [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2986.04s)]
*  Knock knock on a door if someone's home, maybe they don't proceed with the crime, but sometimes they do [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2989.08s)]
*  um, and I can tell you a story that I heard, uh [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2995.56s)]
*  Uh, that really truly shocked me. It took place also in santa monica, which is where i'm from [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=2998.76s)]
*  um [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3005.0800000000004s)]
*  that uh [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3006.1200000000003s)]
*  There was a case of a single woman in her home. It's in a nice part of santa monica [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3007.1600000000003s)]
*  and a [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3012.92s)]
*  These two guys gangsters attempt to knock knock on her [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3014.6000000000004s)]
*  And they breach the door [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3018.84s)]
*  and her dogs attack these guys so badly that they [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3021.48s)]
*  uh, the the the altercation moves into the street and they are [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3026.76s)]
*  Wounded by the dogs. She calls the police [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3032.44s)]
*  Police show up and the gangsters claim that their dogs attacked [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3036.52s)]
*  Them and the cops called animal control [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3043.08s)]
*  and [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3046.84s)]
*  She moved out to texas after that [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3048.04s)]
*  That's crazy [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3052.28s)]
*  but it's also a [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3053.88s)]
*  kind of in miniature [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3056.36s)]
*  The bigger problem which is in california the state is on the side of the criminal against the citizens [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3058.28s)]
*  So if I if I can turn it to like a personal anecdote [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3063.8s)]
*  um [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3067.6400000000003s)]
*  About a year ago, uh my home in santa monica, um, which [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3068.6000000000004s)]
*  It's an affluent neighborhood, but like my house is for sure the the most still habitated on [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3074.0400000000004s)]
*  On the block. It's been in my family, you know through my great grandparents [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3079.4s)]
*  My brother and I uh live there and own it and [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3084.84s)]
*  in september of last year we were subject to um [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3088.92s)]
*  Two home invasion robberies in a row, although I should say [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3094.1200000000003s)]
*  Technically, these are what's called a hot prowl burglary, which means that [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3098.1000000000004s)]
*  Residents are in the in the property when uh, the burglary takes place [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3102.82s)]
*  But don't necessarily confront the burglar if it if they confront them. It's like a home invasion [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3107.8s)]
*  So there's a little distinction. Wait, there was someone home when the my brother and I were home asleep [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3113.7200000000003s)]
*  in the house when when the burglar [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3118.28s)]
*  came in and uh through [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3120.92s)]
*  Uh brazenly through you know, and we were kind of naive because we thought calif [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3123.6400000000003s)]
*  Santa monica is the greatest place in the world, right? So like we had [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3127.96s)]
*  um [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3131.2400000000002s)]
*  A uh, our alarm system was not was not like on and the back, you know back patio door was unlocked. So [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3132.28s)]
*  How he knew that I don't know. Um, but it was a well-lit house. You know, there's [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3139.0s)]
*  There's houses on either side [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3144.52s)]
*  Signs indicating like alarm system [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3147.32s)]
*  um, and yet [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3150.6s)]
*  That did not stop him and so [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3152.6s)]
*  We woke up the next day. Um [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3155.8s)]
*  And my brother was in the main house. We have a little casita, um kind of converted garage where I happened to be [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3158.28s)]
*  um during when this took place and I came into the house and [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3165.16s)]
*  uh, the door back door was wide open and um, I went up to my room and [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3168.92s)]
*  My entire room was destroyed every every valuable item i've ever had in my life [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3174.6s)]
*  Was taken heirlooms from my grandparents, uh gifts from my parents for graduation. Um [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3180.6s)]
*  Really just like really like token memories, you know, um, and [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3188.3599999999997s)]
*  So it was pretty devastating [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3194.92s)]
*  And we called the police and my police they showed up 12 hours later [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3197.24s)]
*  Um [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3201.56s)]
*  They said that when they finally came that the delay was due to the fact that they're dealing with so many [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3202.7599999999998s)]
*  homeless overdoses [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3208.52s)]
*  so [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3210.52s)]
*  Um, they dust for fingerprints and say yeah, this is going to be this is a serious crime and we will take it seriously and [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3211.3199999999997s)]
*  Don't worry. Well the next night [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3218.52s)]
*  um [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3221.56s)]
*  It happens again the next night the next night. Yeah the next night he dismantles [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3223.08s)]
*  A window in our dining room, um, which is also my office and [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3229.2400000000002s)]
*  He uh, he took whatever was left which was nothing there's nothing left [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3235.0s)]
*  He can't I mean the guy would steal things like easter eggs like sunglasses like a letter opener [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3239.16s)]
*  um in addition to really valuable stuff [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3246.2000000000003s)]
*  um, and uh, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3250.04s)]
*  I believe he came back a third night [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3252.2000000000003s)]
*  because uh, I [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3255.0s)]
*  Saw a car [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3257.08s)]
*  Lurking in the middle of the night outside of our house [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3258.92s)]
*  And I saw a figure in this vehicle that ultimately matched the description of of the perpetrator who was caught [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3263.24s)]
*  um about a month about a month later and [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3270.52s)]
*  The story behind this is I think really quite interesting and was the reason why I undertook the research that i've done [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3273.96s)]
*  because [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3281.64s)]
*  The guy who did this to us was an illegal alien [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3282.6s)]
*  a dreamer actually [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3286.68s)]
*  an ms 13 gang member [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3288.68s)]
*  With a a convicted felon who had done seven years in prison in california state prison for violent crimes [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3291.3999999999996s)]
*  He was deported by trump administration homeland security immediately [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3298.68s)]
*  After uh after getting out of prison in fact, he notes, uh, I've I read the whole police report of this [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3303.96s)]
*  in the course of like my trying to understand what took place and [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3310.2799999999997s)]
*  Uh, it's it's funny he comments to the to the cops during his interrogation that [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3314.7599999999998s)]
*  as soon as he was released from [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3320.12s)]
*  state prison ice [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3322.7599999999998s)]
*  Immediately picked him up and deported him back to al salvador immediately [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3324.82s)]
*  And while he was in al salvador, he had his um, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3330.2s)]
*  Uh ms 13 face tattoo removed [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3335.0s)]
*  And he was in al salvador for about a year or so and then went back then traveled to france [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3338.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't for some whatever reason the guy had a back his his day job was as a carpenter [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3345.0800000000004s)]
*  um, and uh, you know, actually his primary language was english, so I guess we can be thankful for that [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3351.48s)]
*  Um, thank you lindsey graham and the dream act [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3358.36s)]
*  um, but [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3361.6400000000003s)]
*  He uh, he sneaks back into the u.s in [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3363.0800000000004s)]
*  2021 under during the biden wave of him of migration [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3366.5s)]
*  And he proceeds to go on a rampage. He does have a kid too at this time. So we now have a u.s citizen [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3371.96s)]
*  to deal with [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3379.72s)]
*  uh, and um, he he robs a dozen houses in the same manner all over la county [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3381.16s)]
*  But also in ventura county [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3387.88s)]
*  He robs the home of a judge a very like well-respected criminal judge who provided presided over the michael jackson [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3389.96s)]
*  death trial [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3398.12s)]
*  Um, it's funny the police report notes that he took the judge's [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3399.4s)]
*  small-wristed [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3404.76s)]
*  Uh seiko watch [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3406.28s)]
*  um, and like just like the guy would took anything and everything he took [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3408.6s)]
*  You know, I saw the police reports and he was taking wedding rings. He took a catholic rosary box [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3414.2000000000003s)]
*  like there was nothing [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3420.44s)]
*  that [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3422.52s)]
*  Was above limits. He he you know, uh again like he stole memories from people [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3423.48s)]
*  And he did so callously and with impunity and he was eventually [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3430.2000000000003s)]
*  uh arrested [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3434.98s)]
*  In uh, simi valley [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3438.52s)]
*  Which is in ventura county, which is tougher on crime overall than in la county, but not by much [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3440.52s)]
*  And when he was arrested [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3447.7200000000003s)]
*  By a joint task force [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3450.52s)]
*  In the middle of the day he was in his vehicle with his wife and child in the back seat [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3453.8s)]
*  The police found on him a loaded uh stolen kimber handgun with hollow point bullets [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3460.92s)]
*  They found body armor, which by the way is a federal crime [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3467.96s)]
*  Because he's a convicted felon. You cannot have body armors convicted felons of federal crime [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3471.96s)]
*  They he found they found strange things like a bachelor's degree diploma from armenia [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3477.88s)]
*  um currency foreign currency, um [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3485.32s)]
*  Knives like it went on and on and on like he was [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3490.36s)]
*  Clearly clearly a violent person and when he was brought into interrogation the officer, uh [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3493.88s)]
*  assigned to him [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3500.52s)]
*  Started by saying thank you for not opening fire on us. We really appreciate that [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3502.04s)]
*  And he said don't thank me because I was planning on [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3507.0s)]
*  Killing you and for sure quote going erics on you whatever that means [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3510.6800000000003s)]
*  And taking my last stand [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3515.7200000000003s)]
*  Had it not been for the fact that my wife and kids were in the car because he said i'm never going back to jail [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3517.7200000000003s)]
*  So fast forward to his uh his arraignment, uh in ventura county [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3524.44s)]
*  He's convicted on one count of one of these charges actually maybe two counts [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3529.32s)]
*  but in any event he's sentenced to [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3533.96s)]
*  Two years in jail and a three hundred dollar fine and he'll probably serve less than that [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3536.52s)]
*  $300 fine. Yeah, did you get any of your stolen goods back? No, no [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3541.2200000000003s)]
*  The way I was notified was because he had my uh, my driver's license and credit cards [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3545.32s)]
*  and so uh [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3551.96s)]
*  As part of the investigation they called all the other victims. They also relayed this information to santa monica police [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3553.32s)]
*  santa monica police [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3560.44s)]
*  Despite the fact that they had a [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3562.04s)]
*  Parenzic team come in and swab and you know, take this really seriously like csi style stuff [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3564.1s)]
*  um [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3571.08s)]
*  The assigned detective on my case has still a year more than a year later not even called me or attempted to interview me [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3571.88s)]
*  They have no interest and i've followed up many many many times [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3579.64s)]
*  They just don't care [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3582.2799999999997s)]
*  They don't care because there's no incentive to care because these crimes are considered property crimes in los angeles county [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3583.0s)]
*  Even though you were asleep in your home when this guy [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3589.8799999999997s)]
*  With a history of violence enters your home with you in it [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3593.08s)]
*  And if if my brother had been awake and woken up [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3596.52s)]
*  I think there's a high chance of a violent interaction that would have taken place [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3599.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, i'm sure he was had a had a gun or a weapon on him when he did this [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3603.24s)]
*  There's no there's absolutely no reason to doubt that so it's a miracle actually that that [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3607.24s)]
*  That were okay [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3612.68s)]
*  Um [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3614.68s)]
*  But I was so shocked by by what happened and and of course after the second night [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3615.7999999999997s)]
*  You [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3621.48s)]
*  Just lose sense of like reality like how is this happening? Like this am I being targeted like [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3622.3599999999997s)]
*  and [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3629.72s)]
*  The cops really had no explanation for this. Um, I think that this guy thought we were an easy mark because it was it's an old house [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3631.0s)]
*  There's still a handicapped parking sign in front of the house [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3639.3999999999996s)]
*  You know, it's a from my grandparents time [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3642.68s)]
*  So he probably presumed there were old people living in the house, you know, and predators go for the week [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3645.16s)]
*  and [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3652.2000000000003s)]
*  So, um, I uh [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3654.28s)]
*  in an attempt to try and like [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3656.6s)]
*  Intellectualize and frame this experience. Um, which still haunts [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3659.3s)]
*  Us to this day. I mean you never feel quite the same in the home [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3665.32s)]
*  You know and it's a terrible thing when like a home that's been in your family for almost like four generations [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3669.7200000000003s)]
*  Is stained and violated it almost feels like an assault like a sexual assault even like it's it's a very very strange feeling [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3676.5200000000004s)]
*  I mean burglaries got you [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3685.5600000000004s)]
*  and um [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3688.2000000000003s)]
*  and [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3690.5200000000004s)]
*  It's made all the worse by [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3691.5600000000004s)]
*  the fact that victims are [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3694.28s)]
*  Re-victimized by the justice system in california [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3696.58s)]
*  and so as I started to talk to [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3701.24s)]
*  um [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3704.66s)]
*  prosecutors and law enforcement agents law enforcement officers about [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3706.02s)]
*  How this could have happened what is going on in the state? Is this common like how could it be common? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3710.92s)]
*  I spoke to a uh [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3718.6s)]
*  very very well respected victims rights advocate and [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3720.68s)]
*  Veteran deputy district attorney for la county a liberal by the way named Kathleen Katie [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3725.4s)]
*  and in the course of my interview and telling this story [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3732.2s)]
*  She said what's what's so important about your story? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3736.68s)]
*  Is that it's so relatable [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3741.0s)]
*  and I said [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3743.8s)]
*  Relatable like how is this in any way relatable? [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3745.56s)]
*  That an ms 13 gang member convicted felon dreamer illegal alien [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3749.4s)]
*  Could break into your house brazenly two nights in a row probably armed threatened to kill police officers [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3755.2400000000002s)]
*  um [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3763.56s)]
*  And get two years in prison and this is relatable [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3764.84s)]
*  So if that is the case [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3769.7200000000003s)]
*  Then the system [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3772.6800000000003s)]
*  Is fundamentally broken and in fact I would go so far as to say that the entire [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3774.68s)]
*  Look civilization is based around the social contract [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3780.6s)]
*  and the the tenets of the social contract [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3784.52s)]
*  is that [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3787.8799999999997s)]
*  We set we we surrender certain freedoms [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3789.24s)]
*  To the government to the state which is supposed to have a monopoly on violence [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3793.56s)]
*  And the state in turn provides protection to us from the anarchic state of nature as hobbes put it [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3798.4399999999996s)]
*  So right and not just in turn but in exchange for yes. It's a transaction transaction. That's exactly we're buying [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3807.16s)]
*  safety and peace of mind in exchange for our money [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3814.8999999999996s)]
*  And some of our autonomy exactly and when and when and that contract has been breached and broken in california [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3819.8799999999997s)]
*  So at that point it's just it's just theft well it negates the it negates the entire legitimacy of the government [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3826.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, that's exactly right [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3832.68s)]
*  Well, how's this for crazy? Has there ever been a more volatile time in american politics? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3834.2s)]
*  Not in our lifetimes. No one alive has ever seen anything like this [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3839.48s)]
*  But long before things started to really fall apart the heritage foundation saw it coming [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3843.56s)]
*  Heritage has pulled together a coalition of over a hundred right-leaning groups to develop a comprehensive plan for day one [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3848.92s)]
*  That would include detailed policy proposals on the most pressing issues the big ones securing the border controlling inflation [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3855.48s)]
*  Cracking down on election fraud protecting the rights of the individual and saving the nation from being crushed by woke anti-human ideology [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3862.12s)]
*  The team at heritage has also developed a plan to dismantle the deep state that keeps this nonsense going [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3871.08s)]
*  And reclaim this nation from the small group of technocrats that's broken everything [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3876.2799999999997s)]
*  Heritage is also running a training and vetting program to identify [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3881.24s)]
*  Effective conservatives to serve in the next presidential administration [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3885.38s)]
*  People who will share your values this country's values and actually do the job [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3889.48s)]
*  It can't just be the same pool of discredited people from washington [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3894.28s)]
*  Populating every administration [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3899.14s)]
*  Heritage has a long head start and they put in a lot of work already [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3901.24s)]
*  But they need your support to finish the job and to support the incoming president [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3904.2s)]
*  You can go to heritage.org [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3908.92s)]
*  And contribute to this important work today [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3911.48s)]
*  A lot depends on it [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3914.04s)]
*  heritage.org [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3916.1s)]
*  So let me just now maybe um [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3918.92s)]
*  A time to ask a question about like just the change in who lives in california. So I lived in la as a kid [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3922.1200000000003s)]
*  I think it was overwhelmingly white the city [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3928.04s)]
*  And now it's overwhelmingly non-white [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3930.84s)]
*  that's um [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3933.48s)]
*  It's not a racist statement to acknowledge. It's a fact and uh as taken by the [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3935.32s)]
*  Department of census [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3939.8s)]
*  Every 10 years and it's a massive change. It's an incredibly abrupt change [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3941.32s)]
*  In fact, it's a bigger change than probably any civilization [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3946.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh ever in history has experienced except during war except during invasion. So like [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3949.8s)]
*  Is that's a meaningful fact and how'd that happen? Well, i'll give you a statistic [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3957.2400000000002s)]
*  in the la [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3963.48s)]
*  uh [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3964.6s)]
*  la [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3965.64s)]
*  school district, um la usd [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3966.6s)]
*  195 000 students are english learners [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3970.58s)]
*  There's 90 languages officially spoken in la usd [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3974.8399999999997s)]
*  27 of california is foreign born [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3979.62s)]
*  Of the whole 27 percent of the entire city is foreign born mind you that doesn't mean like [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3983.3199999999997s)]
*  You know first generation which adds [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3989.4s)]
*  Probably makes a majority at that point [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3992.68s)]
*  In in 1990 it was 20 percent which is still high [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=3994.92s)]
*  Um, that was very much in because of the of the reagan amnesty from the 80s 86 86 [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4000.12s)]
*  But today it's 27 percent and the national average I think is like 13 percent [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4007.8s)]
*  Something like that. Maybe maybe a little higher much higher now much higher because they're illegals, but california is by far [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4014.12s)]
*  Um has the greatest foreign, you know presence in the in the state and I think that [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4020.7599999999998s)]
*  um [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4027.32s)]
*  you know the reason for this is uh that [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4028.2799999999997s)]
*  We had long ago, you know and long before these laws that i've been discussing and we'll discuss [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4032.68s)]
*  enacted policies that incentivized [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4039.48s)]
*  illegal aliens to come to the state because they would get [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4042.6s)]
*  welfare benefits they would get [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4046.52s)]
*  Basically write more rights than the citizens. In fact, I will tell you the junior prosecutors I talked to [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4049.4s)]
*  um for this for this this research say that [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4056.28s)]
*  Under george gascon and and this also is applied to um other, you know other jurisdictions including [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4060.2s)]
*  actually under kamala's [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4067.72s)]
*  policies, but in la county, uh [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4070.44s)]
*  The [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4074.76s)]
*  Illegal aliens who commit certain crimes are given special plea deals that would never ever ever be given to a u.s [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4076.28s)]
*  citizen for the specific person purpose of protecting them from ice [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4082.76s)]
*  So to me that's a due process violation so I do think anybody who advocates for [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4089.2400000000002s)]
*  Not just illegal immigration or mass immigration, but any immigration of any kind has to account first for california [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4094.84s)]
*  Yeah, so here's a state in which it's been tried to the greatest possible extent and it went from the best state to the worst [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4102.36s)]
*  state [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4108.44s)]
*  Now maybe you could say immigration had nothing to do with that [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4109.24s)]
*  But you can't say immigration didn't change california and the fact is california has become a much worse place to live and the [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4111.72s)]
*  Emigration numbers from california prove that six million have left california in the last 10 years [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4118.099999999999s)]

*  Insulated from of course they have private security [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4236.28s)]
*  Of course and and private schools or tutors everything and so the the aristocracy rules the state [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4239.88s)]
*  And yet in california because language is manipulated [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4247.32s)]
*  In almost orwellian fashion oligarchy has become to mean [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4251.8s)]
*  Progressive [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4257.62s)]

*  Um [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4265.88s)]
*  And not to be picky about it [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4267.16s)]
*  But if I could just defend feudalism against what we're seeing in california right now the idea of feudalism [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4268.76s)]
*  While repugnant to the american mind in my mind [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4275.0s)]

*  Serfs as they were dependent upon him. I mean it was a symbiotic relationship for sure. So if the serfs died [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4291.88s)]
*  He became impoverished. Well, the symbiotic relationship here is that the serfs provide [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4299.0s)]
*  electoral hegemony [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4304.900000000001s)]
*  for sure, but [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4306.84s)]
*  I guess what i'm saying is [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4309.0s)]
*  over time a feudal family had a built-in incentive to [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4311.16s)]

*  so um [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4334.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I guess they don't maybe to put a finer point on it the people who whereas the the the lord in feudalism needed the labor [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4336.04s)]
*  of the serfs [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4343.08s)]
*  The lords of california do not need the labor of their serfs because the because the industries are [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4344.92s)]
*  Service industries or their tech and they require a very very small number of people to do exactly right and that that's part of the [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4350.12s)]
*  deindustrialization [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4356.9s)]

*  um and fleeing [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4369.08s)]
*  In in the state, um and especially in southern california [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4371.08s)]
*  And as a result of that, especially the exodus of aerospace and defense industries from the state [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4374.92s)]
*  um, we have uh, you know [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4381.24s)]
*  Republican voters have left and la county which used to be a republican stronghold [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4384.9s)]
*  Yeah, it became a blue stronghold and at that point california became a one-party state and one-party states [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4391.16s)]
*  are [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4398.2s)]

*  Psychosis I would argue [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4404.9s)]
*  um and uh all sorts of evils, um [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4407.48s)]
*  and ultimately, uh, it's it is the [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4412.28s)]
*  antithesis of democracy and of course [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4416.0199999999995s)]
*  That is exactly what? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4418.759999999999s)]

*  Can you just back up one moment? I never thought about that. So you said [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4427.160000000001s)]
*  One party states abet corruption, of course inefficiency [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4430.92s)]
*  all true [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4435.400000000001s)]
*  Psychosis. Yeah, why do you say that? Well, I think because of the laws that we've seen put into effect [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4436.740000000001s)]
*  The laws are so obviously going to [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4443.96s)]
*  um [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4447.620000000001s)]
*  engender [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4448.76s)]
*  Criminality across the state. Yeah, right [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4450.52s)]
*  It's it's like in law, uh, you know in in torts we you know, the the idea of negligence is the foresee [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4453.8s)]
*  Forseeability of harm, right? [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4461.38s)]
*  And that is what really triggers a liability [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4463.8s)]
*  But you knew this could happen, but you let it happen anyway [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4467.24s)]
*  and so the so california's government and and frankly uneducated voters [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4469.72s)]
*  have [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4475.72s)]
*  Conflicted a grievous tort upon the state and I think that it is so reckless [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4477.08s)]
*  That to me it is psychotic. It is a form of psychotic sociopathic behavior [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4483.96s)]
*  And certainly many of the people implementing these policies are raving psychopaths [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4490.28s)]
*  a a a uh, really impressive, um a young [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4496.28s)]
*  deputy district attorney in Alameda county said to me with respect to the [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4502.12s)]
*  kind of progressive, uh da of that of that county named pamela price that she's quote a raging [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4507.4s)]
*  Psychopath who wants to burn down civilization? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4515.38s)]
*  And I will tell you that every prosecutor that I spoke to and I spoke to [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4518.6s)]
*  10 over the course of [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4523.4s)]
*  30 hours of interviews [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4526.6s)]
*  um, and I also spoke to you know equal number of cops [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4528.6s)]
*  But the the one commonality that that every single prosecutor I talked to you mentioned was that there seems to be a motivation [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4532.68s)]
*  By the true believers of burning the system down. They are jacobins. They are radical anarchists [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4540.84s)]
*  They want to hurt you they want to kill you [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4547.32s)]
*  Um, I mean i'm going right to the spiritual explanation for that, but is there another like what could motivate that? [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4553.32s)]
*  I [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4559.4s)]
*  mean look, uh [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4560.6s)]
*  You know if you're if you're asking, I mean of course like personal power, right? So like george gascon is not [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4562.36s)]

*  um on whether or not to [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4711.4800000000005s)]
*  Grant parole [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4713.64s)]
*  um and under gascon [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4714.92s)]
*  Prosecutors who typically would would accompany [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4718.42s)]
*  These victims for this, you know, frankly an ordeal they're you know [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4722.280000000001s)]
*  Seeing your perpetrator again is in a rape case. You can imagine what a trauma that is [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4728.04s)]
*  Well gascon said prosecutors are no longer allowed to accompany victims [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4733.88s)]
*  And in fact what they are now the victims are now required to do [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4738.84s)]
*  Is to write a persuasive essay submitted to the committee and the committee is stacked entirely of public defenders [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4743.080000000001s)]
*  So it's a very serious [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4750.14s)]
*  Serious [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4753.1s)]
*  That's grotesque can I ask something that occurs as you're speaking about gascon so, um, you've said that [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4756.14s)]
*  All organized criminal activity in the state of california is run in effect by the mexican drug cartels through prisons and i've heard people [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4763.34s)]
*  Mention that before so let's just assume that's true. Sounds like it is true. You just wrote a book on it [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4771.400000000001s)]
*  Gascon not know that [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4777.82s)]
*  I mean gascon [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4779.66s)]
*  It's not clear what gascon knows of anything. I'm but i'm just saying let's see in places where the where drug cartels [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4781.58s)]
*  Run things which is a lot of latin america. They also run the politics. Well, let me put it this way [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4787.98s)]
*  even more maybe um [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4794.46s)]
*  Relevant to the time that we're in I would say how did kamala harris not know that [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4797.9s)]
*  Because kamala harris as a as attorney general of california in 2012 [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4803.26s)]
*  Under the auspices of so-called budget cutting budget reform [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4809.5s)]
*  eliminated a 100 year old agency called the bureau of narcotic enforcement and [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4813.64s)]
*  It is widely held amongst law enforcement officers and and on the prosecution side that this was a very important task force [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4819.98s)]
*  For fighting organized crime it had been doing so since prohibition and then it became a major force in disrupting narcotics trade in the state [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4827.9s)]
*  She disbanded it. Well because she's for narcotics. She wants a drug addicted population. She does whatever she's told [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4835.74s)]
*  But i'm just saying like at okay. These drug cartels are powerful because they're ruthless [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4843.5s)]
*  They're a cult based on witchcraft, but they're also really rich. Of course. They're they're fortune 500 companies. Exactly. So [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4849.58s)]
*  at some point like in mexico, they're in control still because [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4857.98s)]
*  They've paid off all the politicians. Well, is that happening in california yet? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4862.94s)]
*  No, it's not clear to me whether that that's happening to the extent i'm certainly um [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4867.42s)]
*  As expressed by you know tom homan when I spoke to him, um, you know [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4871.9s)]
*  He says that you it's very hard to often to distinguish the mexican elite from the mexican drug cartels like [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4875.74s)]
*  They they're this is a there's an interwoven [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4883.099999999999s)]
*  Woven nexus. Yeah [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4885.5199999999995s)]
*  um [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4887.599999999999s)]
*  and uh, of course like in parts of mexico that the the the cartels exert actual [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4888.639999999999s)]
*  Like authority and governance over certain regions in the sir madri. Yeah, for example [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4894.32s)]
*  um, but it's it's not really clear to me if they're influencing politicians or [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4899.12s)]
*  you know through um [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4905.679999999999s)]
*  You know grift or or through bribes or anything. I'm not i'm not clear on that. Yeah [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4908.24s)]
*  It may be just a matter if not, it's just a matter of time. I will tell you that um the [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4912.88s)]
*  a director of the la pd union, um [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4917.36s)]
*  said to me that um [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4921.4400000000005s)]
*  The cartels are increasingly committing, uh ransom attacks in san diego [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4923.4400000000005s)]
*  Of high-profile families and this is not getting reported [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4930.24s)]
*  Kidnapping as is so common in latin america. Exactly. Yeah, they take them across the border and uh, so special like [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4933.92s)]
*  Security forces made up of ex [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4941.4400000000005s)]
*  um [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4944.4800000000005s)]
*  Seals and whatnot have to go into mexico and extract them [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4945.68s)]
*  This is now apparently rampant. It's insane, but it shouldn't surprise us. That's a fact of life in mexico city [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4949.92s)]
*  human trafficking is also a [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4955.68s)]
*  very like [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4958.400000000001s)]
*  Serious problem in the state [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4959.76s)]
*  um [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4961.84s)]
*  And it's of course more lucrative in some ways than the drugs because they can be used as over and over and over again [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4962.64s)]
*  As sex slaves, right? So it's like it's like a recurring revenue stream [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4968.72s)]
*  although fentanyl should not be um [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4973.04s)]
*  under my under uh [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4976.240000000001s)]
*  You know underplayed in any way fentanyl produces like 200 000 margin [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4978.8s)]
*  Yeah, and fentanyl according to um the top one of the top gang enforcement detectives [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4985.2s)]
*  in la county [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4992.72s)]
*  based out of compton [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4994.400000000001s)]
*  Um ex special forces guy black guy incredible man [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=4996.16s)]
*  Uh, he said to me fentanyl. It's so ubiquitous. It's like salt [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5001.04s)]
*  And if you buy a pill off the street, it has fentanyl in it [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5007.04s)]
*  And that's why you know [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5011.12s)]
*  In fact, it's so deadly and so dangerous that even the cartels are thinking that maybe we need to come up with something [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5013.12s)]
*  Not quite as lethal because we're killing our customers [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5019.12s)]
*  Can I just ask since you mentioned compton so compton was the largest black population [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5022.9s)]
*  West of the mississippi since the second world war. I was just there [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5028.82s)]
*  It's spanish speaking. So you've had [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5033.86s)]
*  You know the black population of huge parts of la moved east [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5036.9s)]
*  Into the inland empire murdered in huge numbers [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5041.219999999999s)]
*  By newcomers and i've never heard and maxine water supposedly represents compton though [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5045.54s)]
*  She doesn't live there, but i've never heard a single black politician in california [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5050.18s)]
*  Mentioned the fact that illegal immigration has like completely overturned life for a lot of black people in california [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5053.860000000001s)]
*  Not one time i've heard anybody say that why? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5059.46s)]
*  What about your corrupt pigs, yeah, I mean obviously but I I think it's I think it's uh due to the fact that [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5064.42s)]
*  The power is now the locus of power is with the newcomers [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5071.54s)]
*  Of course it just but so it's not in their interest to ever comment on these things [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5076.419999999999s)]
*  But if your job is to represent your your constituents or your people [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5080.259999999999s)]
*  When have democrats ever represented black people? Oh fair fair. I know it's just i'm it [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5084.179999999999s)]
*  It's like shocking this could happen and everyone's watching it or people are paying attention or seeing it [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5089.7s)]
*  Especially if you're from california like well, this is very different from what it was 10 years ago [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5095.0599999999995s)]
*  And nobody says a word, you know, it's interesting [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5098.98s)]
*  So in in prison the prison system the the black gangs every it's all obviously racially segregated [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5101.54s)]
*  but the black gang is called, um [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5107.86s)]
*  the black gorilla family and [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5110.9800000000005s)]
*  um again according to this gang enforcement [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5113.9400000000005s)]
*  Specialists that I spoke to [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5117.92s)]
*  He said like well for the mexicans. It's about money money and power [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5119.78s)]
*  for the black gorilla family [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5124.02s)]
*  Their enemy is the government [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5126.26s)]
*  And like they're political and I thought to myself well at least they have an ethos [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5128.58s)]
*  It's just interesting, you know california state prisons are totally racially segregated [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5136.5s)]
*  In fact, they were ordered [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5140.1s)]
*  Desegregated at one point and then the prisoners complained the black prisoners complained because people are getting so many that were getting killed [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5141.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look the fact that this sort of level of criminality can exist within the prisons. It's such an indictment [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5146.9800000000005s)]
*  Of of the system overall, I mean it's it's a joke and in fact all these cops I talked to say [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5154.02s)]
*  The gangsters laugh at us. They have no [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5160.26s)]
*  Fear of us. They do not fear the state then how are the prison guards the highest paid state employees in california? [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5163.14s)]
*  Because public sector unions have enormous power in sacramento [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5170.18s)]
*  But I mean if I think that that was always true prison guards are always the highest paid [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5174.34s)]
*  I mean, it's a dangerous job. I agree. I'm not I I know prison guards [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5179.459999999999s)]
*  I've always liked them [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5183.379999999999s)]
*  but on the other hand if your job is to guard the prison and you're getting paid more than anybody else working for the [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5184.259999999999s)]
*  state in california and [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5189.78s)]
*  The gangs run the prisons and that's like there's something wrong with that. Look obviously there's enormous corruption such that phones are smuggled in [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5191.78s)]
*  A communication network obviously exists because how are you able to manage a criminal empire from within jail? [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5200.099999999999s)]
*  How are you able to order executions and hits within jail? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5206.5s)]
*  So there it's porous [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5211.54s)]
*  But I think the bigger issue ultimately and this is why I don't think it's the prison guards fault. It's the state's fault [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5213.62s)]
*  we the [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5219.780000000001s)]
*  Gangsters do not fear the law [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5220.96s)]
*  They do not fear the law and they they commit crimes with impunity [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5224.02s)]
*  They're committing increasingly gun crimes with [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5228.26s)]
*  With impunity because gun enhancements as we talked about no longer apply in many cases [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5231.3s)]
*  So gun violence has gone way up like number of uh, I think gun victims in the last three years [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5237.7s)]
*  Has shot up in la county like 63 percent [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5244.18s)]
*  Um, it's you've got very strict gun control exactly, right? [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5247.86s)]
*  So how hard is it for you to own a gun in california? So I don't own a gun. Um, I I should [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5252.66s)]
*  at this point, but um [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5259.46s)]
*  Uh, I I understand like it's quite it's quite, you know a a difficult process [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5261.46s)]
*  Um, and a lot of the the guns that the criminals are using are all stolen [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5266.98s)]
*  They're not like going to you know, a sports shop and buying buying a rifle [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5272.66s)]
*  You can get a 12 gauge for like 400 bucks. Yeah mosberg, but like like have you thought about that? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5276.82s)]
*  I mean, I i'd love like one of your like beautiful hunting rifles [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5282.9s)]
*  I think you're better off with a 12 gauge hard to miss in close quarters. Yeah. Yeah easy to operate [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5287.14s)]
*  Well, you know actually they say the cops say the best defense [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5292.820000000001s)]
*  Against these kinds of crimes is a is a big dog [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5296.34s)]
*  I have a cat [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5300.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think uh [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5302.42s)]
*  I think the cops lie a lot about guns. Sorry with respect to cops. They don't want any competition [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5304.5s)]
*  They want to be the only armed people on the scene. Well, they're getting competition [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5309.38s)]
*  Well, i'm very aware of that cops tend in general to be against an armed citizenry [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5312.42s)]
*  I like cops. I always defend cops but on this one question, you know [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5318.02s)]
*  There are employees they can keep their dumb opinions about guns to themselves as far as i'm concerned [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5321.06s)]
*  And you have a right to have a gun and and I have a lot of dogs [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5324.900000000001s)]
*  I love dogs, but a 12 gauge is more effective than a dog. I'm just telling you. Oh for sure. Yeah for sure [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5328.18s)]
*  Um, I will tell you you know on the cop issue [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5335.06s)]
*  Another factor of this story is the erosion of the quality of cops [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5338.1s)]
*  Yeah, so what about that? Who'd be a cop in la? Well right now we're recruiting daca [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5343.54s)]
*  You know illegal aliens into the la pd [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5348.9800000000005s)]
*  Actually, yes [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5351.62s)]
*  There's been five so far and um a scandal actually illegal aliens. Yeah, they're not allowed to own firearms, right? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5353.22s)]
*  They cannot have a firearm [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5360.900000000001s)]
*  When they're off duty [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5363.7s)]
*  You have illegal alien cops. Yes [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5366.0199999999995s)]
*  So if we import seven million [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5369.14s)]
*  Military age men into the united states illegally which the biden administration has done [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5372.0199999999995s)]
*  It does raise the obvious question [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5377.3s)]
*  What is this exactly? Is this a mercenary army? [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5380.58s)]
*  For the ruling class. It certainly seems like one and if they're making them cops then it kind of well, let me tell you a [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5384.26s)]
*  Story that's not been reported [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5391.78s)]
*  Uh is a cover-up and it was conveyed to me by a senior director [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5393.94s)]
*  um of the la pd union it's called the la police protective league and this is also a [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5399.0599999999995s)]
*  25 plus year veteran of the la pd and detective and both his daughters are in the la pd is like [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5406.9s)]
*  He uh, he is as plugged into this world as anyone in fact [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5413.94s)]
*  He said to me in our in our interview he says I tell everyone don't come to la we cannot protect you [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5419.22s)]
*  But on the daca issue, um, apparently in february of uh [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5427.7s)]
*  Of uh, yeah this last february [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5434.1s)]
*  Um a off-duty la pd detective encountered two members of the sereno gang which is a very violent powerful [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5437.14s)]
*  Latino gang in southern california, uh, they were attempting to um, uh rob his steal his car [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5446.099999999999s)]
*  So there was an exchange of gunfire and the gangsters got away in in their getaway car [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5454.66s)]
*  They were they were apprehended the next day and it turns out that the car was registered [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5461.86s)]
*  to a daca cadet in the la pd [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5468.5s)]
*  And the la pd quietly shuffled her either out of the program [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5472.5s)]
*  Or just covered it up entirely, but the la times did report on this incident. So they're hiring [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5478.26s)]
*  illegal female illegal aliens with gang cops with gang ties. So at that point it's just they're [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5484.34s)]
*  I mean [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5491.38s)]
*  It it's not a legitimate guy. I mean at that point you're just like you're begging to be overthrown [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5492.5s)]
*  Of course, right of course, do you know how i mean they have no legitimacy cops are increasingly [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5496.74s)]
*  Finding alternative revenue streams by becoming private security [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5502.34s)]
*  Officers for the elite and a lot of the officers that I've talked to are doing that because it's so lucrative california has the highest [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5506.58s)]
*  Pay rates for for private security and the highest demand for private security in the nation [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5515.62s)]
*  And in fact, like i'll just tell you and it's it's it's this is a difficult thing to substantiate [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5520.74s)]
*  For a variety of reasons, but I think it's it's interesting [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5526.5s)]
*  Which is that I heard from you know, this this la county sheriff [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5530.82s)]
*  former like major crimes bureau lead and now in private security that [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5535.7s)]
*  It he believed it was quite, you know [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5542.0199999999995s)]
*  well known but quietly known in in the secure private security industry that george soros or or his [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5545.06s)]
*  His proxies were investing significantly in private security businesses [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5552.42s)]
*  This was also confirmed to me by a former head of federal security for lax [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5558.18s)]
*  And one of the top traders on wall street [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5564.74s)]
*  so [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5568.9s)]
*  You know again george soros's portfolio [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5569.78s)]
*  And transactions are are privates. It's a family office. We really don't know where the investments are going [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5573.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, but I think it's it's quite it's quite um [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5580.98s)]
*  Striking to think that there may be other incentives beyond simply [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5586.179999999999s)]
*  undermining the law for some kind of sake of uh, you know creating a new a new world a dystopia, of course, but [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5591.599999999999s)]
*  Nevertheless, um, I don't think a trader a a financial trader. Maybe one of the greatest in the world [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5599.84s)]
*  Stops becoming a trader [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5606.34s)]
*  Right, no the worship of money is a disease and it's yeah [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5608.74s)]
*  so I guess you go back just a couple minutes, so you said that [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5612.58s)]
*  Kamala harris [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5617.62s)]
*  Dismantled the anti-narcotics task force that had been around since prohibition [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5618.96s)]
*  I'm wondering though. She has bragged publicly about dismantling the cartels. That doesn't seem like the behavior of someone who's dismantling cartels [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5625.06s)]
*  How could she dismantle the cartels? I just I just explained that the cartels run the state [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5632.82s)]
*  Right, so when she says that I mean, there's no truth in that at all [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5637.86s)]
*  There's no truth in anything that she says [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5641.62s)]
*  I mean she is a she is the avatar of moral bankruptcy that represents the state of california. Yeah hollow [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5643.86s)]
*  superficial [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5651.76s)]
*  stupid [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5653.06s)]
*  Sociopathic and I will tell you everyone that I know who? [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5654.64s)]
*  Democrats who have worked with her including like a very elite consulting firm that tried to manage her campaign at one point [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5658.400000000001s)]
*  They say that she is lazy [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5664.5s)]
*  Steve coulee also says that by the way, she's a lazy prosecutor [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5666.66s)]
*  And she is vicious and when she doesn't do her homework [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5670.18s)]
*  And gets caught in you know word salads because she doesn't know what she's talking about [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5675.14s)]
*  She then lashes out on her staff. So she's kind of like a [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5680.34s)]
*  even dumber version of hillary clinton [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5684.74s)]
*  um, and [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5687.62s)]
*  um, I think fortunately like she's so inept that the country is starting to see that I pray to god because [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5689.3s)]
*  If if kamala harris rises to the level of the presidency we now have basically exported [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5697.06s)]
*  california [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5704.08s)]
*  Nash nationwide and and I'm and as I told you in the name of my book it is called failed state [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5705.38s)]
*  A portrait of california in the twilight of empire [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5713.14s)]
*  I can't think of a sadder title or a more accurate one and I just refer back to my own childhood in that state [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5717.62s)]
*  I mean the distressing thing is it's not like wrecking, you know, I don't know. I don't be mean [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5723.780000000001s)]
*  I could think of a couple states that you know, whatever who cares california was the greatest place on planet earth. Of course. Yeah [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5728.02s)]
*  So, um, but you know, it's interesting about kamala. She actually did go after uh, you know drug crimes [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5734.820000000001s)]
*  But she went after people who were smoking weed. Yeah the easy ones the easy ones [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5741.46s)]
*  Right a lot of black people. Yeah, but she did not go after the cartels bringing in [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5747.62s)]
*  the drugs for something no [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5753.22s)]
*  So, um, let's talk for a minute about who runs california. So you're from southern california and i'm as am I I spent most of my [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5756.1s)]
*  Childhood in southern california [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5761.780000000001s)]
*  Which was you know by far the most dynamic prosperous part of the state by far for sure aerospace you had some ag [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5764.900000000001s)]
*  Obviously tourism and then you had the creative industries the movie business the record business both headquartered there. It's all gone except the ag [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5772.18s)]
*  um [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5780.18s)]
*  But that's not the part of the state that runs everything. No, no, and it hasn't for some time [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5781.38s)]
*  Um, we haven't really had a true republican governor [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5787.62s)]
*  Since like the mid 90s with pete wilson. Yep. Pete wilson put forward a a very very famous [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5791.14s)]
*  Proposition called 187 which is vote supported by voters by over 60 percent [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5798.58s)]
*  and it effectively was to [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5805.3s)]
*  Um [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5808.26s)]
*  Restrict any sort of social services except like non-emergency. So we still [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5809.7s)]
*  allowed for that to illegal aliens and [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5815.54s)]
*  You can't reward people who are here illegally with your money. So right exactly. So we we went from that [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5819.78s)]
*  To let's say like I think a month or so ago this the legislature put forward a bill that would give [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5826.099999999999s)]
*  illegal aliens [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5833.46s)]
*  Preferential mortgages gavin newson to his credit vetoed that [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5835.3s)]
*  Referential mortgages they were they were very sweetheart deals like can I just say because I can't contain my resentment [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5839.84s)]
*  So ever since prop 187 passed and that was invalidated by a judge because it's a democracy where some judge gets to [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5848.26s)]
*  override the will of people [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5854.820000000001s)]
*  Um, it's also fake [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5856.34s)]
*  But ever since then a certain kind of republican consultant and that would be the dumbest people i've ever met and i'm speaking [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5858.02s)]
*  Specifically of frank luntz the guy with the hairpiece, but there could be many others. Yeah [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5864.02s)]
*  They've lectured republicans about how 187 lost california was a republican. Oh, I know it's such a lie [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5868.580000000001s)]
*  But it's a republican state and prop 187 which should deny [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5875.06s)]
*  Welfare benefits to illegal aliens that was hate that was racist [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5878.660000000001s)]
*  Republican consultants and guys like mitch mcconnell and all the dumb people in the party bought that [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5882.96s)]
*  Well, and of course because they're funded by the coke brothers and the coke brothers want to bring in cheap illegal alien labor [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5887.38s)]
*  Yeah, simple as that [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5893.46s)]
*  I mean [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5894.740000000001s)]
*  I think was lennon said that the the capitalists will sell you the rope that we'll use to hang you of course [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5895.54s)]

*  Um, but but back to your question how reasonable that is it's not oh, it's beyond reasonable and california used to be a reasonable [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5903.06s)]

*  And 2010 roughly it was a pretty damn good place like steve coulee in los angeles [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5924.74s)]
*  uh [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5931.7s)]
*  You know cleaned up a lot of the mass even his predecessor jackie lacy did it did a relatively good job [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5932.66s)]
*  Although she was chased out of office by um blm. She's black [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5938.0199999999995s)]

*  and um [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5955.38s)]
*  So we then have george cascone [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5956.5s)]
*  Uh who received two million dollars from george soros? Um, that was enough. Uh, it was [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5959.3s)]
*  For a da race that actually was an extraordinary amount of money. Um, it's interesting because [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5966.1s)]
*  soros played money ball with [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5972.02s)]
*  uh these da races all over the country because he realized that [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5974.740000000001s)]
*  The district attorneys have enormous power because they can set policy about what crimes are going to be prosecuted which are not [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5979.22s)]
*  um [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5987.46s)]
*  Some of these other directives that I mentioned earlier about cash bail and and so forth [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5988.26s)]
*  Although george source is actively excuse me george cascone is actively in violation of state law and just operates, you know [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=5992.9800000000005s)]
*  nonetheless [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6002.02s)]
*  Um, but soros understood that with a few million bucks [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6003.38s)]
*  You could change a da race. Why would you want to why would soros who's a foreigner? [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6008.58s)]
*  I beg your pardon from hungary not from here. Why would you want to wreck someone else's country? [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6015.62s)]
*  I don't understand that soros da's have jurisdiction over like 75 million americans [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6020.66s)]
*  Like it's crazy, what's the motive like why would you want your george soros you grew up in war-torn europe [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6027.64s)]
*  Then you go to england you help destroy their economy, right? [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6033.88s)]
*  Which he did and then you come to the united states [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6037.24s)]
*  Which is like the nicest country in the history of the world and you decide you want to take your ill-gotten gains and use those [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6039.5599999999995s)]
*  Funds to wreck someone else's country. Like what is what's the motive here? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6045.48s)]
*  I talked to a lot of people about this and [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6050.84s)]
*  And [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6053.5599999999995s)]
*  You know initially again, I didn't want to even go down the soros [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6054.759999999999s)]
*  you know [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6059.5599999999995s)]
*  rabbit hole because I oh you're not allowed you're not allowed but also like [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6060.5199999999995s)]
*  It's cliche at this point. It is it is cliche. But but the fact is that it's real [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6065.799999999999s)]
*  it's real and [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6070.759999999999s)]
*  It begs the question of why? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6073.959999999999s)]
*  Is it simply he is a anarchist? [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6076.2s)]
*  You know anarchist, uh, is he a financial terrorist I would say yes [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6079.18s)]
*  but [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6085.0199999999995s)]
*  What is the motivation? [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6086.54s)]
*  I I think again, you know it I do not believe a a world class [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6089.099999999999s)]
*  Arbitr you know arbitrager trader [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6096.12s)]
*  Um ever kind of leaves that mindset. There's always it's always money that motivates [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6099.26s)]
*  So I think it is it's you know, again, this is entirely speculation [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6105.42s)]
*  But I would be very interested to see what is the portfolio of the family office of dj. Soros [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6109.179999999999s)]
*  Is it real estate? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6114.62s)]
*  because certainly the crimes [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6115.98s)]
*  Surge in cities like san francisco and los angeles [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6118.78s)]
*  Have depressed real estate in these downtown districts by 25 at least and insurance premiums have gone way up [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6122.86s)]
*  so [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6131.42s)]
*  Is there a is there a trade there? Maybe I don't know but as I said, um, there's a you know [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6132.62s)]
*  there's people that I I trust and who [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6139.26s)]
*  Would be in a position to know that indicate that there is [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6142.38s)]
*  potentially other motivating factors at least with respect to soros [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6146.28s)]
*  So that being said, you know, it's just crazy how little defense the united states has [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6151.42s)]
*  Like we don't have moral defenses. We build this amazing thing amazing greatest thing that's ever been built by [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6157.099999999999s)]
*  any people in all of history [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6162.7s)]
*  and then a few [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6165.5s)]
*  I don't know evil figures like soros roll in [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6167.42s)]
*  And we're totally incapable of saying hey foreigner go away. You're not allowed to do that [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6170.86s)]
*  You can't do that to us [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6174.94s)]
*  And by the way, we'll like execute you if you try to do that [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6176.46s)]
*  I mean a normal society would say, you know, we built this you can't wreck it [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6179.099999999999s)]
*  But we're totally incapable of normal society [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6182.62s)]
*  Okay would have and given the kind of violent criminals that are endemic in california [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6185.66s)]
*  And that run prisons right and commit murders in prison literally [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6191.76s)]
*  Against guards even a normal prison, I think [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6197.36s)]
*  would have um capital punishment applied to these prisoners [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6200.96s)]
*  You know in the prison yard hangings, right something whatever it takes to [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6206.32s)]
*  Bring fear of the law and of the state to those who fear only [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6212.48s)]
*  The justice of the mexican mafia that is that is who they fear when they go to prison. It's not the state [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6217.839999999999s)]
*  It's a joke then then the mexican mafia is the state then oh in effect in effect. Yeah, this is the final word [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6225.2s)]
*  If if it is actually yeah. Yeah, they are the final arbiters. Yeah, they're the final arbiters [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6232.4s)]
*  So then then they're above the state [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6238.48s)]
*  Yeah, they are [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6240.719999999999s)]
*  Um [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6243.599999999999s)]
*  So i'm sorry. I keep interrupting you just because it's that's an emotional subject. I think it's a really important subject [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6245.28s)]
*  It's really it's really really upsetting. Well, you still live there. Yeah [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6251.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's deeply upsetting to see your home [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6254.96s)]

*  But you're saying that los angeles is not where the decisions are made. Where are the decisions made in california decisions? [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6264.48s)]
*  The locus of power in california [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6270.88s)]
*  Is centers around a very elite [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6274.18s)]
*  And small milieu in san francisco [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6278.02s)]
*  Largely around an area called pacific heights. Oh, that's where i'm from. All right [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6282.34s)]
*  Originally, oh, that's so funny pacific pacific heights is the center of evil. Um, well and uh, pretty neighborhood though [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6287.6s)]
*  Well, san francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. It used to be [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6294.58s)]
*  Um, you know like much of california, um, but in any event, um the oligarchy, uh, that has been [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6299.54s)]
*  Really in in place for almost a hundred years starting with the getty's involvement [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6308.26s)]
*  with [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6315.86s)]
*  Uh the newsome family and the newsom's family involvement with jerry brown goes back to the 1940s and 50s [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6316.58s)]
*  and um [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6324.9s)]
*  The scions of each of these, uh, these dynasties [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6326.26s)]

*  um, you know big kind of [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6337.46s)]
*  You know entrance into the scene was forming a restaurant group called plump jack, which he which was seeded by the getty family [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6339.9400000000005s)]
*  uh, and was [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6347.62s)]
*  also co-founded with uh [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6349.3s)]
*  Billy getty who is the son of gordon getty who is the son of jay paul getty [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6351.9400000000005s)]
*  Um, and uh, the eddies have funded gavin's entire political career and they have made that possible [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6357.06s)]
*  in the uh, the the winery and restaurant group [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6364.18s)]
*  The success of that became a launching board into san francisco city politics [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6367.78s)]
*  Um, I think he was on the board of supervisors and then became mayor [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6373.22s)]
*  um and uh, but always there was this this uh, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6377.38s)]
*  commonality and um [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6381.6s)]
*  nexus, uh between [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6383.9400000000005s)]
*  Um pelosi's family pelosi's husband the getty's [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6386.18s)]
*  Uh the browns and the newsom's [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6390.5s)]
*  So they're the old money elite that have been running the state [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6394.02s)]
*  For you know on or off since the 1940s [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6398.74s)]
*  I mean, of course there have been republican governors here and there it used to be as we've talked about like a [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6402.58s)]
*  Um, a sort of moderate state, you know, sometimes you voted for democrats sometimes very republican usually voted for republican candidates [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6408.179999999999s)]
*  presidential candidates last one was george hw bush [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6415.38s)]
*  but um, you know the the [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6419.38s)]
*  The accumulation of power amongst this circle really took hold [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6422.26s)]
*  After these changes that that we've talked about in southern california the deindustrialization of southern california [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6427.54s)]
*  the the exodus of [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6434.66s)]
*  At least six million [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6437.46s)]
*  middle-class californians in the last decade and um [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6439.94s)]
*  And the and the aerospace and defense leaving leaving southern california. So la then became a democrat [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6444.34s)]
*  Uh a stronghold when it was once a republican stronghold [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6451.54s)]
*  And power shifted to san francisco and the other reason power shifted san francisco [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6455.54s)]
*  Is because of the presence of tech [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6461.3s)]
*  Big tech yeah, big tech is the new money and the new money [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6463.9400000000005s)]
*  interweaves with the old money through vc [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6469.06s)]
*  investments and private placements and other sorts of um, you know, uh, it's kind of social circles and [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6473.04s)]
*  bohemian grove like you name it and um [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6480.26s)]
*  so we then have a [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6484.02s)]
*  power structure of [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6485.9400000000005s)]
*  uh an industry that [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6487.9400000000005s)]
*  Is made up of very few people a lot of foreigners by the way [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6490.339999999999s)]
*  of course and um [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6494.98s)]
*  these kind of dynastic [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6498.0199999999995s)]
*  Almost like ancient aristocrats in their in the manner of patron-client relationships that define [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6500.58s)]
*  um, uh this paradigm [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6508.74s)]
*  And and they have uh, you know formed an enormous [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6511.78s)]
*  um [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6516.9s)]
*  Uh, let's say power block, um with tech and and through that, um connection [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6518.0199999999995s)]
*  Uh california has been ruled by this oligarchy, but it's just weird in the physical effects [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6526.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean my mom's family got to california in the 1850s from maine [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6532.9s)]
*  To find their you know fortune and they did [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6536.58s)]
*  And so i've sort of gone there my whole life was born there. Um [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6539.78s)]
*  And it was you know, I thought a nice city liberal in some ways very traditional in other ways [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6543.46s)]
*  But kind of the same like the city that saw the least amount of change [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6549.14s)]
*  and then [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6553.06s)]
*  after during the tech boom [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6554.58s)]
*  99.98.99 all this money came in not just the south bay. Yeah, rename silicon valley but into the city particularly after 2000 [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6557.12s)]
*  And I thought well, okay san francisco is really rich now. Yeah [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6565.46s)]
*  It'll get better right it was it was pretty nice I thought but it will get better the richer the city got [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6569.620000000001s)]
*  The dirtier it got the more dangerous it got the more chaotic it became. Yeah [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6576.820000000001s)]
*  The money made it way poorer. Yeah, what is that paradox? And it's very interesting [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6582.1s)]
*  Well, it's bizarre when twitter moved its head because you know, all tech was again south of the city [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6587.780000000001s)]
*  But then when the tech companies started moving into cities like oh, it's this beautiful city. It's our capetown [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6592.740000000001s)]
*  And then it became like such a rich city richer city in the united states [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6597.400000000001s)]
*  It instantly became dirty like what is that this is happening in southern california, too [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6602.68s)]
*  So in venice, california, google has has established a big office [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6607.4800000000005s)]
*  and venice is [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6613.56s)]
*  um marred by uh [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6615.64s)]
*  Just tragic levels of homelessness. Um, they're shocking shocking and [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6618.4400000000005s)]
*  Sites that I had only seen when traveling like to you know, the poorest parts of guatemala [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6624.2s)]
*  um [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6631.32s)]
*  Maybe worse in some ways [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6632.28s)]
*  but right around the corner from the google office in [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6634.28s)]
*  venice [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6639.16s)]
*  is a um [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6640.44s)]
*  Let's call it a shanty town a favela even maybe but tent after tent after tent and [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6642.2s)]
*  right next to google [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6650.04s)]
*  It's a fascinating dichotomy [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6651.8s)]
*  and I was told uh by uh, someone who would know in the private security sector and a former former cop [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6653.8s)]
*  That he has observed because he has done work for google [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6661.88s)]
*  that [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6665.64s)]
*  gang members [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6666.92s)]
*  local gangs [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6668.52s)]
*  extract tribute [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6670.360000000001s)]
*  From each homeless tent every single day 20 to 50 dollars a day [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6672.68s)]
*  And this is happening he claims across the city there's 75 000 homeless in los angeles [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6679.08s)]
*  And if they cannot meet the tribute they are forced to sell drugs or other crimes and by the way [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6686.92s)]
*  Thanks to I believe this was a new sum policy [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6694.76s)]
*  um [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6699.4s)]
*  Cops require have to get search warrants to enter any tents. So the tents have become [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6700.5199999999995s)]
*  denizens of [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6706.34s)]
*  dens rather of murder of rape of drug [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6708.68s)]
*  the worst kind of drug trade [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6712.84s)]
*  um and other forms of depravity that [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6714.92s)]
*  Shocked the senses and it's right next to google right next to google [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6717.88s)]
*  So I don't know. I think obviously i'm too simple to understand the modern world, but I always thought that the problem was poverty [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6721.72s)]
*  And that people committed crimes because they were poor [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6728.68s)]
*  And the richer your society became the safer and more orderly it became [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6731.24s)]
*  But the exact opposite has been true and it makes you wonder like [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6735.639999999999s)]
*  Is there some evil emanating from these tech companies answer? Obviously. Yes [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6740.12s)]
*  That inspires chaos depravity [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6745.32s)]
*  Crime violence and filth. Well, I I think that the answer is is also a structural economic because [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6748.44s)]
*  Tech is not based upon [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6755.719999999999s)]
*  um [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6758.2s)]
*  employing [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6759.16s)]
*  Vast numbers of people it's right, right? It's it's not productive labor [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6760.679999999999s)]
*  Of course. No, I get it. I mean, it's like nine guys from india writing code exactly [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6765.32s)]
*  And so when when when that becomes the dominant [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6769.88s)]
*  economic power in the state [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6773.299999999999s)]
*  and and manufacturing [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6776.5199999999995s)]
*  leaves the state [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6778.5199999999995s)]
*  And there's where do the where where do people where do the poor poor working class people turn to okay? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6780.2s)]
*  But so but here's the housing crisis is is also I get it [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6785.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean it it drops the value of labor to zero for the rich people [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6788.84s)]
*  Just to reply to your point about it's getting richer and yet worse [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6792.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's getting richer. Uh, and but the areas where the rich people live like atherton are looking real nice these days [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6797.24s)]
*  I was just an atherton atherton's great athernet malibu is great [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6805.24s)]
*  There are pockets of yeah, I think malibu still is great. Yeah, it is [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6809.0s)]
*  um, it's so far away, you know that um, it can be great but [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6812.44s)]
*  I wonder if the city of san francisco though is such a great example of the failure of leadership [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6816.6s)]
*  And the failure of the ruling class to be vested in the society from which they're taking their riches [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6822.280000000001s)]
*  In a normal society the rich people would say hey, I live here my kids live here. You can't do that shit [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6827.240000000001s)]
*  You know get off the sidewalk. We're gonna pay we're gonna make the san francisco police department the most efficient and highly endowed police department [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6832.280000000001s)]
*  In the world, we have no crime. Exactly the saudis did that [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6839.240000000001s)]
*  Why can't why don't the tech barons do that because we became a one-party state, right? [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6842.36s)]
*  So when steve coulee was da of los angeles, uh, you know, he was not about politics [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6847.0s)]
*  in fact, he says the the the job of a da is not to [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6855.08s)]
*  in you know, uh [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6860.2s)]
*  kind of [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6862.599999999999s)]
*  Bring politics into the into the administration of justice [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6863.4s)]
*  It is to go after bad guys and prosecute bad guys and send them away and make the city safer [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6867.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah using the laws the elected legislators, right? And in fact at a local, you know [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6871.96s)]
*  this was also the case even in san francisco back in like the [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6877.96s)]
*  2000s and the predecessor to kamala harris a guy named, um talanan who [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6882.42s)]
*  Uh harren's talanan. Yeah, right and he he was a liberal but also like [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6887.0s)]
*  One with a sense of like duty to do the job [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6892.04s)]
*  But I think what happened is sometime around like again around the 2000 late 2000s when gavin newsome and kamala harris really came into [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6895.8s)]
*  into their um, you know into their to their power structures, um, and it's especially san francisco [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6904.52s)]
*  Uh, it became not about let's make this city better. Let's make this safer. It's about [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6910.84s)]
*  How do I get my next promotion? [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6918.04s)]
*  You know term limits in california were which I supported were supposed to fix all this [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6921.8s)]
*  And they seem to have made it worse. Do you understand? Again? This is one of those paradoxes that I don't fully understand. I've just noticed [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6928.04s)]
*  I don't know. I mean they didn't work. I think we can say that right? I mean clearly it's clearly something's not working [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6937.080000000001s)]
*  right again [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6944.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6945.8s)]
*  Could you remember that maybe you don't remember but maybe you're too young but like tremolins came to california and you're like, okay [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6946.84s)]
*  This is going to make legislators much more responsive [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6951.56s)]
*  They can't live forever in these dumb jobs, but it seems like they have lived forever [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6955.160000000001s)]
*  In these dumb jobs. They've just traded up jobs. They just keep moving around [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6960.120000000001s)]
*  You know, i've also heard it's compared to like the fact that we have a full-time legislature versus [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6963.400000000001s)]
*  Texas that has a part-time legislator and that has a moderating effect [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6968.740000000001s)]
*  Um, I think I think that's like a good analog. Um for comparison. I mean sacramento is out of control [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6973.8s)]
*  Um, we there's super majorities democratic super majorities in both houses. There's not a single republican at any any [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6980.5199999999995s)]
*  administrative, um, you know, uh officer level position in the state. I think the last one was maybe [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6988.26s)]
*  Insurance commissioner, right and there are no statewide republican, correct? Officeholders. That's right. Yeah, there haven't been for years [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=6994.84s)]
*  And the minority republican minority is so small in the legislature legislative bodies that they're [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7004.44s)]
*  Irrelevant and our republicans are weak. I mean meg whitman was pathetic [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7010.2s)]
*  She ran she spent 150 million dollars of her own money [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7015.48s)]
*  To run for governor in 2010 and she lost overwhelmingly to jerry brown [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7019.88s)]
*  Yeah, I went to a I went to her house in athelton speaking of athelton at that time [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7025.72s)]
*  um [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7030.44s)]
*  What is it you would think that the republican officeholders in the state the few who remain would be [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7031.96s)]
*  Even clearer-eyed and more resolute, but they seemed even more cucked [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7037.08s)]
*  Oh, yes, I would say I would say so. I mean the california republican party basically doesn't exist if you want to run [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7041.32s)]
*  As a as you cannot run as a republican. I mean for instance, uh, [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7048.679999999999s)]
*  Uh, rick caruso ran for mayor, uh recently, um, he was [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7054.5199999999995s)]
*  You know well known republican, um, but he had to switch in los angeles against karen back [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7060.12s)]
*  Yeah against karen bass and uh [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7065.72s)]

*  She she has done the job. She was tasked for which is to have a black woman as mayor and fulfill an identity politics [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7105.0s)]
*  um quota in my opinion [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7113.88s)]
*  Um [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7117.96s)]

*  At least two terms now governor. Um, is he popular? [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7126.6s)]
*  You know, i'm not i haven't seen like, uh any any recently polling on that [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7131.64s)]
*  Have you ever been at dinner and heard someone say man? I'm just glad gavin newson runs our state [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7137.32s)]
*  No, no [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7141.88s)]
*  So in a one-party state doesn't really matter like everyone's brezhnev at a certain point. It doesn't really matter exactly [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7143.24s)]
*  Yeah, whether people like what they're getting they're getting it. Yeah. Yeah, the only thing that matters is the democratic primary, of course [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7148.68s)]
*  And there is like internecine [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7156.68s)]
*  Divisions within the party just like in china. Oh big time, right? And in fact, it's kind of interesting that [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7159.38s)]
*  Um, you know gavin is not like on the hard left of the democratic party in california. Um, I I actually in some ways [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7165.4800000000005s)]
*  think he's [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7173.240000000001s)]
*  Probably much more reasonable and moderate than than he [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7175.24s)]
*  You know has portrayed himself to be [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7179.24s)]
*  Um, I I think as someone who knows him I can confirm that yeah, that is true. Yeah, he's gavin newsome is [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7182.5199999999995s)]
*  I think responsible in large part for what's happening in california. There's no excuse for that. He'll be held [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7189.08s)]
*  You know, he'll be held accountable for that on some level in some life [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7195.0s)]
*  However, just in point of fact, he is not some crazy left-winger. No, look i'll be honest with you [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7199.24s)]
*  I like him personally. Yeah, everyone does. Yeah, I really do and I I really wish you know, he was a phenomenal governor [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7204.04s)]
*  I think [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7211.88s)]
*  You know if if we do have to live in a one-party state at least our leaders should be, you know, really competent [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7212.76s)]
*  Within the machine. Um, and I think he had a lot of potential. Um, and certainly [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7219.48s)]
*  You know, but but he's also a slave and captured by [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7227.72s)]
*  By this movement and this this leftism, um that has has has cast this pal over [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7231.72s)]
*  California he's weak inside. There's no doubt. Yeah, so can I ask like what the there are still very powerful business interests [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7239.0599999999995s)]
*  Mostly the people making ai planning our enslavement [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7245.4s)]
*  Why don't those people get together and just like pay for a good government? [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7250.28s)]
*  Well, I will tell you that I have heard at least from folks in the vc world that [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7254.44s)]
*  um [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7259.88s)]
*  there is [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7261.08s)]
*  a lot of um [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7262.68s)]
*  Quiet support even in this cycle for for trump. Well, that's true [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7266.28s)]
*  There is and there's some loud support. I mean mark andresen who's the biggest vc in the state has come out for trump publicly [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7271.96s)]
*  So that's good. But I just mean within the state of california [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7279.56s)]
*  Why don't they get as long as you're going to have a corrupt one-party state as long as it's going to be guatemala [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7283.400000000001s)]
*  Okay, fine. That's what we are now [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7287.16s)]
*  Why don't the oligarchs get together and just say well, we're the least going to have [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7289.4s)]
*  I don't know nice roads and functional schools and your [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7294.12s)]
*  Daughter's not going to get raped on the way to cvs. Like why not just do that? I think it's not it's because it's because these [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7298.84s)]
*  Nobles do not have no blas oblige [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7304.2s)]
*  Now we're cooking with gas that's exact. Okay, can you expand on that? Yeah [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7308.44s)]
*  so [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7313.16s)]
*  so the idea, you know for [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7314.5199999999995s)]
*  Societies that are stratified by class and where there's especially [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7317.400000000001s)]
*  You know an aristocracy that has a political, you know hegemony as well as social power [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7323.72s)]
*  There was a sense I think in in those kind of societies in the past even even frankly, you know within the united states that [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7330.68s)]
*  There were certain responsibilities [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7337.88s)]
*  as a noble [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7340.92s)]
*  to your [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7342.68s)]
*  Your county to your to your city to your to your you know [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7344.36s)]
*  Land and so forth to your nation to your nation, of course [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7348.92s)]
*  but [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7353.639999999999s)]
*  Today we have a situation where [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7355.08s)]
*  There's a disconnect from that and it's entirely about the self and it's nihilism. They all wear t-shirts and live on boats [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7358.44s)]
*  Right, they're totally disconnected completely removed from the the bad schools from the bad roads [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7365.799999999999s)]
*  Um from the crime they have private police force basically because they're not christians. That's the actual difference [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7373.4800000000005s)]
*  They're not christians. They're not believing christians and a believing christian feels a sense of obligation to the poor [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7380.92s)]
*  And the people over whom he exerts authority to the people below him. I mean, that's just part of the religion [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7387.64s)]
*  Well, right so like when we talk about neo feudalism and and maybe how that's not a perfect analog [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7393.32s)]
*  I would add in support of your approach is well at least in feudalism they believed in god [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7398.28s)]
*  Well, and that had certain obligations actually structured the entire society, right? Well, this is a separate conversation [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7404.76s)]
*  But I was probably 40 years old before i'm interested in history [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7410.12s)]
*  I realized that the thousand years between the fall of rome and the renaissance were referred to as quote the dark ages [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7413.24s)]
*  And there's sort of very little conversation about that among people who specialize in european history and it's like why why are we dismissing? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7420.36s)]
*  A thousand year period as the dark ages because actually it wasn't that dark [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7426.52s)]
*  It's actually these were not societies built on, you know, debt slavery. These were societies built on [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7431.400000000001s)]
*  Christianity and that's kind of why they've been dismissed as as dark and unworthy of [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7438.02s)]
*  further study or [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7443.64s)]
*  You know [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7445.4800000000005s)]
*  Conversation we have nothing to learn from the dark ages and that's all like a huge lie [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7446.52s)]
*  Actually, they had a much more enlightened ruling class than we have [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7451.64s)]
*  I I would say that you know, if you're going to make historical comparisons to like let's say are we in a new dark age? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7455.719999999999s)]
*  you could argue that you know the dark the so-called dark ages was characterized by a [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7463.24s)]
*  Separation from hellenism and classical ideas [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7470.599999999999s)]
*  and and literacy right and so [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7476.599999999999s)]
*  I think you could ask you frankly that [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7480.44s)]
*  That modern America actually modern society as a whole [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7482.84s)]
*  Um, and this especially during california is also disconnected from its history. It is forgetting its history purposefully [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7487.56s)]
*  Oh, I know and we're also becoming [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7495.0s)]
*  Ironically, we're we're we're subject to more information than we can absorb and so we absorb nothing [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7498.1s)]
*  And maybe that's a kind of new illiteracy [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7505.16s)]
*  I [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7507.32s)]
*  Think that's exactly right and I think good weather plays a huge role in this places with really good weather [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7508.44s)]
*  You see this on australia as well [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7513.0s)]
*  um [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7515.24s)]
*  Allow people to sort of drift along [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7516.04s)]
*  In a state of content [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7519.5599999999995s)]
*  numbness, yeah, and they don't ever they're sort of content with [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7521.62s)]
*  You know an ever declining [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7526.44s)]
*  standard of living and [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7529.16s)]
*  An ever shrinking basket of freedoms at this point in california of the right to have an abortion [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7530.84s)]
*  That's kind of your only right and they just are so because it's 75 and sunny they don't complain [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7534.76s)]
*  You know what I mean? Whereas in say romania. Yeah, they might they might complain [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7541.8s)]
*  Yeah, it you know, it'll be very interesting to see if they're ever if things get so bad that it catalyzes [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7546.6s)]
*  action, uh by the voters [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7554.280000000001s)]
*  One of these prosecutors I talked to um from alameda counties [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7557.64s)]
*  We were discussing the broader implications of how we got to the place that we did and she says she said to me [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7562.2s)]
*  um [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7569.400000000001s)]
*  She said I blame you and I said what? [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7570.84s)]
*  Said I blame and when she said I you I mean the uneducated voter, right? [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7574.12s)]
*  the the voters that [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7579.96s)]
*  um are are [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7582.04s)]
*  Susceptible to the marketing gimmicks of our of our politicians [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7584.820000000001s)]
*  That reframe [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7590.860000000001s)]
*  Legalizing theft as safe neighborhoods and schools act [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7592.92s)]
*  And this kind of complacency has resulted [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7597.820000000001s)]
*  You know in in a significant way to the to the degradation of the state [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7601.5s)]
*  Well, it's just look this is just a dot on a continuum. This is a moment in time [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7606.7s)]
*  And all every bad thing that you described has been made possible by liberal whites [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7611.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, and yes, they're bad they're decadent attitudes and [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7617.66s)]
*  California is a latin american country basically now [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7622.06s)]
*  With some recognizable latin america country problems like rule by cartel and corrupt politics and the rest one party state [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7624.7s)]
*  But at some point it's going to be characterized by another feature of latin american society [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7630.780000000001s)]
*  Which is fascist interludes where you're going to have like a military junta or some strongman take over california and all these new immigrants [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7634.54s)]
*  They're not [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7641.900000000001s)]
*  Rich white liberals actually they probably don't think theft should be legal [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7643.1s)]
*  And you're going to get some cardio in charge of that state. He's going to put an end to all this nonsense, you know, and [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7647.42s)]
*  Maybe that would not be so bad. I mean it's preferable to what we have now [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7653.26s)]

*  It's not a hard choice [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7663.42s)]
*  So that's very different from the state that you and I grew up in completely different which was a basically an egalitarian [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7664.3s)]
*  State or even rich people like I grew up in a rich part of the state [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7670.46s)]
*  And we didn't feel like we were a class apart [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7674.219999999999s)]
*  That everyone else was a serf [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7677.58s)]

*  376 ad and 476 ad and what we're experiencing now in california and that period and I just say [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7717.02s)]
*  It's so thank you for saying that [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7723.84s)]
*  Because the fifth century is when we think of the end of rome [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7726.24s)]
*  But we forget that there was at least a century preceding that where it was like on the way to the fall [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7728.8s)]
*  Of course. Yeah, and and it was characterized by things that are eerily similar to what we're seeing in california [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7733.4400000000005s)]
*  So, of course, there is the erosion of borders. There is the influx of [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7740.08s)]
*  uh of migrants about I think like one or two million from [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7745.92s)]

*  That's right. Um, yeah, and and there was also cultural factors where the elite um were [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7768.96s)]
*  Uh, hansen calls this it was called luxus [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7777.28s)]

*  and therefore [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7843.76s)]
*  Um, we see in her, uh this [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7845.5199999999995s)]

*  But it's never interesting do you know what I mean it's always whining about microaggressions and I write [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7895.52s)]
*  You know freedom and all it's just like it's so banal you can just barely stand it [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7901.76s)]
*  I would rather have an interesting dictator, you know [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7906.96s)]
*  The chapter my book on her I I call the banality of evil. Yeah. Well, it's perfect. Um, and uh, it's the sense that [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7910.64s)]
*  these like [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7919.12s)]
*  These actions or inactions rather over time [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7920.64s)]
*  That seem incremental [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7924.4800000000005s)]
*  lead to outcomes that actually produce [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7927.04s)]
*  Incredible evil and violence exactly and though she is not pulling the trigger, right? [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7931.12s)]
*  She's not even passing some of the laws. I I hope I can get to um, which are even more insane than what I've already told you [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7936.8s)]
*  um [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7944.400000000001s)]
*  But she nevertheless is part of this machine [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7945.52s)]
*  And she's also tied to the getties by the way, just incidentally [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7949.04s)]
*  Um, they all they all are [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7952.9800000000005s)]

*  So there's nothing there are no accomplishments to speak of and this nothing changed when she was vice president [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7963.06s)]
*  No, but this is what happens when girls become dictators, right? They kill they they build nothing they create nothing [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7968.9800000000005s)]
*  You don't even get like big pretty buildings out of it and then they kill you by passive aggression [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7974.66s)]
*  Exactly, yeah, no, this is uh, i'd much rather yeah [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7980.1s)]
*  I'm not to make a gender thing out of it [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=7983.62s)]

*  2016 that passes [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8004.96s)]
*  We we jump ahead to [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8006.82s)]
*  2020 where I think everything broke down across the world [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8009.28s)]
*  But especially in the united states and especially in california [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8013.38s)]
*  And as a result of the george floyd [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8017.78s)]
*  Um riots which by the way all of the law enforcement officers i've talked to who were there and were there for the [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8021.7s)]
*  1992 riots say these two cannot even be closely compared [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8028.4s)]
*  Gangsters in la during the george floyd riots were laughing their asses off because they didn't give it [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8032.82s)]

*  We need a revolution. Okay, exactly and [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8046.26s)]
*  Um, oh by the way, uh, the guy who robbed us on the police report [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8048.9800000000005s)]
*  It says like any drugs or you're on any drugs and he writes in like crayon [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8053.46s)]
*  fentanyl [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8058.1s)]
*  He's on fentanyl. Yeah. Yeah, he's on everyone's on fentanyl [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8059.3s)]
*  In the criminal world, it's like salt on fentanyl. Yeah, it's like salt [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8063.860000000001s)]
*  Well, he was taking it because he had been stabbed like a year or two before [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8067.46s)]
*  Um, and so he takes it for the pain and to stay level when he's doing carpentry and not it's so soul-killing [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8072.5s)]
*  Have you ever taken opioids like after a surgery or something? I mean, I love laughing gas [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8079.22s)]

*  I'm not defending nitrous, but I will say it's a totally different gig [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8087.46s)]
*  But you know any opioid drug has the same it just takes your soul away. Yeah. Well, that's what we see [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8090.099999999999s)]
*  That's why it's the zombie apocalypse. Right? That's it [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8096.42s)]
*  but but so so in after the the riots and there was a [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8099.299999999999s)]
*  momentous push for um [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8105.28s)]
*  Again, I I call crime equity legislation and this took the form of two laws that have been [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8108.34s)]
*  Absolutely devastating and I think that they probably will ultimately get thrown out by the supreme court because they're they're so egregious [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8116.18s)]
*  The first is called the racial justice act of 2020 [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8123.3s)]
*  and the racial justice act of 2020 [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8127.7s)]
*  Allows defendants and it's retroactive [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8131.46s)]
*  to challenge their convictions [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8135.14s)]
*  based on the presence of [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8138.34s)]
*  bias or racial animus [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8141.12s)]
*  By let's say anyone involved in the trial or on the police side [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8144.08s)]
*  Now that doesn't have to have any bearing on whether or not the evidence supports their guilt [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8150.5599999999995s)]
*  At all, these can be guilty people the evidence proved beyond a doubt [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8157.04s)]
*  But if there was a white racist involved at any level they can get their convictions thrown out under the racial justice act or reduce [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8161.04s)]
*  Significantly and this happened in the city of antioch [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8168.14s)]
*  It's called the antioch texting scandal [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8171.76s)]
*  four young black gang members were on trial for [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8174.8s)]
*  um, uh attempted murder and murder and [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8178.96s)]
*  Very clear that they did it [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8182.72s)]
*  Um, they were gang enhancements were applied to them, which would mean that they were going to face a lot more jail time [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8184.72s)]
*  uh, but at the same time, um, it came out that the police officers in antioch were [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8193.28s)]
*  Texting racist, uh, so-called racist messages to each other in private not [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8200.16s)]
*  You know not as part of the job not relating to even their their, uh, you know, uh, [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8206.4s)]
*  Involvement in the case but just about these defendants and when this came out [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8212.32s)]
*  um [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8217.84s)]
*  the judge presiding over the case, uh [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8218.880000000001s)]
*  Utilized the racial justice act and threw out all the gang enhancements against so they had no longer killed anybody because the cops were [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8222.4s)]
*  Mean, let me tell you how much worse it gets [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8229.68s)]
*  defense attorneys can use [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8232.32s)]
*  statistical [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8234.86s)]
*  evidence nebulous statistical evidence of racial disparity to [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8236.16s)]
*  support the case [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8241.6s)]
*  Um and satisfy their burden of proof that there is racial injustice [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8243.28s)]
*  So for instance if a jurisdiction is applying gang enhancements [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8248.16s)]
*  in greater proportion to black, you know gang members than to some other group white gang members [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8253.04s)]
*  Yeah, whatever those are [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8259.92s)]
*  um and uh [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8261.92s)]
*  uh the um under the racial justice act the statistical, um, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8263.92s)]
*  Differences can be entered into consideration by the judge and whether or not to apply the um rja [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8270.7s)]
*  That's just like the end of civilization it gets worse [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8280.64s)]
*  um [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8284.48s)]
*  the same year they the [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8285.52s)]
*  Sacramento passed ab 3070 ab 3070 [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8287.58s)]
*  Took away the ability of prosecutors [[02:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8297.52s)]
*  to apply peremptory challenges [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8301.2s)]
*  To prospective jurors on the basis of bias. So for instance [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8304.880000000001s)]
*  up until ab 3070 [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8310.560000000001s)]
*  You could if if a jurors would say, you know, my son was or had been [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8312.96s)]
*  Involved with um had been arrested or I have a negative opinion of police [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8320.24s)]
*  So on and so forth. This would be a cause by which a prosecutor could use a peremptory challenge [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8325.84s)]
*  to remove the juror [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8332.64s)]
*  Well under ab 3070 if this juror is a member of a protected group [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8334.88s)]
*  Which by the way includes um gender identity [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8341.84s)]
*  So like training criminals? Yeah. Well, no, no training jurors. Oh, okay. Yeah, um [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8346.560000000001s)]
*  They can no longer use peremptory challenges against them even if they say [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8353.44s)]
*  I hate cops [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8358.880000000001s)]
*  Because they're a protected group. So the result of this [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8360.640000000001s)]
*  Is as uh, one of the top prosecutors in the entire state told me [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8364.240000000002s)]
*  Um is the proliferation of oj oj juries [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8368.96s)]
*  And the oj jury by the way never got the credit we never learned a single thing from that [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8374.48s)]
*  We spent our entire lives hearing about all white juries being bad [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8379.36s)]
*  But here we had a jury that just let a guy get away with murdering two people [[02:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8382.48s)]
*  Because those people were a skin color that was fine [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8387.52s)]
*  Another another gang prosecutor in alameda county told me that jurors have come up to her [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8390.64s)]
*  Um and said to her face I will not convict a black man [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8396.56s)]
*  So [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8405.44s)]
*  Okay. Well now i'm officially depressed and and just and just sad about the state [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8406.8s)]
*  So let's just let's just end on a happy note if you're possible if it's possible worse [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8411.52s)]
*  Do you see california getting? [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8416.48s)]
*  Better. I mean is this like a low point or is this just like is it you know, um [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8419.2s)]
*  Some of the cops I talked to say that they they think this is cyclical and things will [[02:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8424.32s)]
*  Things will come back into some level of normalcy. Um, you know, there's Detroit never came back [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8429.84s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8436.72s)]
*  Neither did rome after 476. It's still a crappy place as far as I can tell [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8438.24s)]
*  I mean, you know, uh, I I don't know. I I think that [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8443.84s)]
*  There are some time there are some problems that become so embedded and given the multifaceted [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8447.92s)]
*  nature of this dysfunction [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8452.98s)]
*  And the complexity of the problems and the entrenched interest groups that do not have [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8457.06s)]
*  any incentive [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8462.66s)]
*  To to modify a system that has enriched them [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8464.74s)]
*  I don't know how you will so I think maybe the um the lesson for me just as a listener to this incredible story that you've just [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8469.14s)]
*  told [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8475.52s)]
*  Um, the main lesson is that civilization is really fragile [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8476.66s)]
*  You don't maintain it without continuous effort and vigilance [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8480.02s)]
*  And you really have to be radical in [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8485.300000000001s)]
*  In preserving it. Yeah, and once it goes away, it doesn't necessarily come back [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8488.58s)]
*  And you should not participate at all in unjust systems at all and you should fight like a wombat [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8492.42s)]
*  Yeah, I mean like look if we're talking about solutions for me [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8497.380000000001s)]
*  for one thing it is [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8502.02s)]
*  it is [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8504.42s)]
*  Revoking these terrible laws that i've talked about like that that's has to happen [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8505.54s)]
*  How about shaming the people who supported them? It's totally unacceptable. I mean, yeah, well, I don't know anything about bullconner, but like i'm sure his [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8509.78s)]
*  Descendants all change their names. I'm not defending bullconner. Trust me [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8518.480000000001s)]
*  But there is a useful thing that culture does which is demonizes demons. I would go further [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8521.380000000001s)]
*  You should do that. I would go further. I think it's it's more than simply shaming [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8527.380000000001s)]
*  I think I think if there is a way [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8530.580000000002s)]
*  That to hold these people liable for negligence and gross negligence criminally liable criminally liable [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8533.779999999999s)]
*  So why should george cascombe be able to like move to tempi and just live out on retirement? [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8538.66s)]
*  I don't think he should be alive. Why should the politicians in europe and in this country who facilitated the invasion? [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8543.14s)]
*  of their countries and displacement and [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8550.34s)]
*  And diffusion of their native indigenous populations as a form of let's face it a form of ethnic cleansing [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8554.42s)]
*  Why should those politicians who enacted those laws not be subject to the same kind of standard? [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8562.259999999998s)]
*  That was applied in the nuremberg trials or how about as recently as the the yugoslav wars the nato's war in yugoslavia [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8569.22s)]
*  I think slobodan milosevic died in prison for ethnic cleansing. So angela merkel gets away with it. How is that? [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8576.419999999998s)]
*  look the international laws related to these issues are not [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8582.5s)]
*  robust enough to address this modern form of [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8586.5s)]
*  demographic inversion demographic [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8591.12s)]
*  Engineering but really when I was thinking about this as a whole [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8593.76s)]
*  Is it really all that different from what the chinese are doing in jinjiang? [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8598.82s)]
*  Like yes, we're not we don't have we don't have reeducation camps yet because we're not as straightforward as the chinese [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8602.42s)]
*  but but the idea of of like bringing the han chinese into [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8607.86s)]
*  jinjiang to to [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8612.64s)]
*  Effectively erase those people [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8615.38s)]
*  Is that really any different than what's happening when 12 or you know, seven million people have come across the u.s [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8618.1s)]
*  southern border [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8625.62s)]

*  And reverses that I mean it's [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8634.5s)]
*  Times are very dark tucker and I don't know like if there is a positive message to be made except I [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8636.900000000001s)]
*  I pray that [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8643.300000000001s)]
*  Our leadership at that least the federal level [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8646.019999999999s)]
*  Will write the ship and perhaps california over time [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8649.619999999999s)]
*  Can come back to some semblance of what it once was because it is the defacement of a grand work of art [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8654.179999999998s)]
*  It is a it is a work of art in los angeles and san francisco two of the prettiest cities in fact [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8660.5s)]
*  I would say the prettiest cities we have by far [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8664.82s)]
*  Both of them in their very different ways [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8667.3s)]
*  But um, it is destroying art and irreplaceable art and as a birthright californian who's living in his great-grandparents house [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqcKs15txTg&t=8669.699999999999s)]
