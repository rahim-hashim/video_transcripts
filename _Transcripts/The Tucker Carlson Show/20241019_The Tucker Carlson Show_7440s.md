# Tucker & Charlie Spiering React to the Al Smith Dinner, & Why Democrats Are Turning against Kamala
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E)
*  So how long did you marinate in Carmella Harris and how do you pronounce her name? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=0.0s)]
*  Well as she she issued a ad when she ran for Senate featuring children to remind everybody exactly [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6.38s)]
*  How she expected her name to be pronounced and obviously, you know [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  That if she if you diverge from that then you are automatically accused of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=17.22s)]
*  All sorts of things but most of all it's a very racist thing to do you saw the same accusation go when [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=22.82s)]
*  Donald Trump did his Al Smith dinner speech [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=30.02s)]
*  Said Kamala and that made a lot of people very angry who are so how can you be racist if you don't know what race? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=33.38s)]
*  She is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=39.66s)]
*  Well, she's not even sure who I'm discriminated against when I'm discriminated against Carmella Harris or whatever name is right [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=40.86s)]
*  I imagine that if you if somebody mispronounced your first name, then perhaps you could say that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Well, if I if I pronounce my own first name at least two different ways as she has we have it on tape [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=53.78s)]
*  Then I think it would be a lot [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=59.5s)]
*  To attack other people for for pronouncing it differently, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=62.74s)]
*  It's something that if you're that insecure about how people pronounce your name, you know [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=66.82s)]
*  It shouldn't be you should just be able to either quietly correct them or be completely just go with it [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=71.02s)]
*  Yeah, but she's made it very clear and spent money to make it clear. This is how I pronounce my name [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=78.78s)]
*  So [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=88.64s)]
*  How long did you spend like staring at [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=104.78s)]
*  Kamala Harris like how long did you work on this book? Right? So I started in January [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=108.9s)]
*  2023 just doing the research and pulling everything together [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=115.26s)]
*  So about a year I spent we're working on researching writing the book and wrapped it up the first draft by the summer of 23 [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=118.82000000000001s)]
*  so just to skip to the end and we'll unpack it of course, but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  Did by the end of your research? Did you like her more or less? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=131.5s)]
*  Yeah, probably less but I learned so much about her that it just seemed [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=136.06s)]
*  You know, she she frequently talks about you know, never let anyone else tell your story you tell your story [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=142.18s)]
*  She cites this all the time [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=148.02s)]
*  She cited it last night during the al smith dinner video that she did never let anyone else never let anyone else tell your story [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=149.28s)]
*  you tell the story and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=156.28s)]
*  That statements strikes me is very fundamentally un-american right? It seems like if you run for office then [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=158.8s)]
*  If you tell your story, it's probably not real [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=166.28s)]
*  There's probably a lot more to the story than your preferred version [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=169.92000000000002s)]
*  And so that was a huge part of it just finding out more about her [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=173.5s)]
*  but also just the endless talking about herself is she and everyone in her social class and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  Political party all they do is talk about themselves, right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=183.66s)]
*  But only in very scripted ways, right? How about at all like talking about yourself is like and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=186.62s)]
*  The I would say the main thing I mourn [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=193.62s)]
*  Is I look back in the world I grew up in that's now gone the thing I miss most [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  Is the directive that came very clearly from my family and I think in most families like shut up about yourself already [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=202.12s)]
*  Stop talking about yourself. It's not about you you freaking narcissist [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=208.48s)]
*  Well, that's why so much of her campaign depends on her identity. No, but have you noticed this? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, maybe it's just the culture the angle culture [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=216.4s)]
*  I grew up in like you were not welcome to talk about yourself all the time. Mm-hmm. That was considered just [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=218.64s)]
*  Not acceptable not very rude and pompous like you don't want to be that person [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  Politicians are kind of encouraged to talk about other people instead [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=230.94000000000003s)]
*  Oh, of course [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=234.74s)]
*  Don't I think for her a huge part of it is just crafting her identity from the very beginning [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=235.94000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, when she first started running for national office, she was very focused on creating this image of her as a person [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=240.9s)]
*  Really baking in to her identity first of all that she was the product of that. She always cared about politics [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  She always cared about justice [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  She grew up marching and shouting with her activist parents who pushed her in a stroller through these protests and then you know [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=256.66s)]
*  skip a few decades and then suddenly she's sort of the product of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=264.06s)]
*  the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=268.70000000000005s)]
*  overarching progressive movement that somehow she's always been this progressive liberal who has always been very [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=270.5s)]
*  focused on justice and truth and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Has made it part of her life and part of her biography when that's not really true [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=280.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, it's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=285.48s)]
*  Demonstrably not really true. I'm not sure what is true about a couple of episodes in her life that I've heard really nothing about it [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=287.2s)]
*  one is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=293.48s)]
*  her high school years in Canada and I think any adult looking back will concede that high school is the period that forms you more [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=295.36s)]
*  than any other and [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=303.88s)]
*  That period in her life was spent unless I'm misremembering in Montreal, Canada [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=305.96s)]
*  Right a huge part of her life was spent in Montreal and so you're kind of alienated from any sort of your upbringing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=311.74s)]
*  So sure she's definitely alienated from San Francisco and the Berkeley [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=317.66s)]
*  Environment where she was raised kind of brought to a similar location academic neighborhood high middle class [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=321.7s)]
*  I believe that you know is it was not a not a [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=328.56s)]
*  Working or middle-class neighborhood in Montreal in Montreal. Yeah, and she was the product [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=332.62s)]
*  She went to a school with you know [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=337.7s)]
*  a lot of elites in the in the country and was certainly aware of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=339.56s)]
*  What was going on but it was sort of she was sort of alienated from the overall American experience, right? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=343.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, she did spend her high school years in Canada and she might have gone home to California for some of the summers [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=347.96s)]
*  I think there's evidence that she did so to visit her dad on a couple occasions [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=354.91999999999996s)]
*  But I don't think she spent much time there. Did she graduate high school in Canada? I think so and then then she's Canadian [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=359.56s)]
*  I'm serious like why are we pretend it's like Obama who grew up in Indonesia. I don't and Hawaii. I don't understand why [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=367.21999999999997s)]
*  We're ignoring everyone seems to be ignoring the obvious, you know, you are formed by your years in high school. And so she's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=375.26s)]
*  Basically very inspired by people in her life [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  People who were in California to go to Howard [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=386.7s)]
*  This is definitely a product of Kamala Harris seeking to sort of seize on an identity by going to Howard in DC as [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=390.1s)]
*  you know this historically black university and really sort of embracing that identity and [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=399.92s)]
*  using that as she moved back to California and into the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=405.44s)]
*  You know went to law school in California and sort of jumped into the legal world [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=409.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the the peril Obama's a much smarter and more talented I think than Kamala Harris [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=413.0s)]
*  but there is a similarity in that both of them have these [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=419.88s)]
*  rootless childhoods not their fault, of course broken families pretty tragic family situation for both of them and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=425.2s)]
*  both of them and neither one of them has anything to do with [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=431.96s)]
*  American black culture at all [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=436.88s)]
*  Either genetically or culturally they've just nothing to do with it and both of them decide to become [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=439.14s)]
*  American black people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=446.48s)]
*  Right. That's why she brings up who she calls her second mother a lot [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=448.48s)]
*  She was raised in a by her single mom who was always at work and then in the same building [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=452.04s)]
*  There was a person who ran a daycare center miss Shelton and this is the woman who is actually [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=457.48s)]
*  from the black south [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=464.28s)]
*  The black south she referred to this is the person woman she refers to as her second mother who's a small business owner [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=466.28s)]
*  Okay, so this is the woman she was talking about nurse because I was totally confused. Right. Who is this woman? This is a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=474.44s)]
*  Regina Shelton she ran a daycare business in the same building as as their apartment and she helps raise the children [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=480.11999999999995s)]
*  while mom's at work and so [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=488.32s)]
*  She describes this woman as her second mother and this is the mother who is connected with the black south that took Kamala to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  You know Kamala talks about her taking them to a Christian black church where and even she says they sang in the choir [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  At this church and so whenever she's in a place where she's speaking to the black church. She refers to this experience [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=504.8s)]
*  Whereas when she was running for office in California, so she went to a black church once [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=512.24s)]
*  All the time apparently yeah according to common [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=517.48s)]
*  but at the same time when they were doing magazine articles with Kamala Harris's real mother she taught said that and [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=520.16s)]
*  They were speaking to certain audiences [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=527.04s)]
*  her real mother said that she grew up in the Hindu temple and practiced all of the traditions and and [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=529.6s)]
*  Believed in all the Hebrew in all the Hindu [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=537.4s)]
*  Religious practices so she was actually a polytheist in childhood, right? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=542.08s)]
*  And when she first starts running for office, there's there's a couple incidents where she starts referring to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=546.76s)]
*  This Hindu goddess [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=554.36s)]
*  And [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  We're using her she uses this Hindu goddess at I think it's Pavarti [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=559.04s)]
*  Who is both? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=564.84s)]
*  She's both a vengeful [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=567.3199999999999s)]
*  warrior and also someone who's very loving and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=569.52s)]
*  So she refers to this goddesses as someone who inspired her decision to get into law enforcement and justice [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=572.8000000000001s)]
*  So there's what yeah, so she will goddess [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=579.76s)]
*  Yes [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=584.0s)]
*  Hindu goddess inspired her to get into justice [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=586.08s)]
*  Someone who can be both a vengeful goddess, but also a caring and loving goddess was she suggesting that this goddess was real [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=589.76s)]
*  Right this this character in her in the mythology of the Hindu religion, I don't think it's considered mythology [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=598.1800000000001s)]
*  I think it's considered real. Oh from if you truly believe in we have a fury. I don't I don't think it's fake [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=605.6600000000001s)]
*  I think you think it's real. It's unclear and it may be entirely real by the way, right? But from a Christian perspective, that's demonic [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=611.58s)]
*  so no, I'm not right kind of taking sides though, I have an opinion but [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=618.22s)]
*  obviously, but as a as a theological matter [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=622.98s)]
*  Those couldn't be more [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=628.1s)]
*  incompatible with each other like you can't [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=630.14s)]
*  Unless you're running for political office, right then you can take those the opposites. That's like saying, you know, it's like [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=632.6600000000001s)]
*  You know going to a PETA conference in the morning and you know [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=638.38s)]
*  Cattle rancher conference in the afternoon and saying I love you both like that's just not possible. But those are the best politicians [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=642.5s)]
*  Okay, you covered the White House for a long time you're more cynical than I am okay [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=650.5s)]
*  Interesting so she said she was inspired by a goddess right a Hindu goddess to again from a Christian perspective a demon. Mm-hmm [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=654.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean that that's what Christian right? I guess in the end [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=661.9799999999999s)]
*  she also sang in the black choir and about justice and learned about justice and and [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=665.42s)]
*  Loving my name was she a canter in her synagogue too. Do you know I don't know [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=670.3s)]
*  Maybe that's Doug's role. I don't know if he goes to synagogue very much. I don't think so [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=677.2199999999999s)]
*  Okay, amazing has she ever talked about [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=682.86s)]
*  The Canadian part of her childhood. No, not much. Oh, yeah [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=686.1800000000001s)]
*  That definitely came from her mother and some of her earliest profiles [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=693.3000000000001s)]
*  Back when they were just running for her first offices district attorney [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=697.1800000000001s)]
*  yeah, and trying to make the case that she was a [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=700.9s)]
*  real genuine person who really wanted the job and had an [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=704.54s)]
*  Cultural identity that was close with San Francisco and [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=708.5799999999999s)]
*  Really made the best case for her and she was sort of running for office and she mentioned Canada then no [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=712.42s)]
*  No, Canada was not in the okay in the but but the goddess was [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=718.0999999999999s)]
*  Yeah a little bit. Yeah for sure [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=723.9s)]
*  amazing [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=727.62s)]
*  So [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=730.3399999999999s)]
*  the Howard University years [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=731.9s)]
*  Did she participate at all politically at Howard that we know of well she has a photo right of her protesting at some march on [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=734.02s)]
*  Washington, but that's pretty much the extent of it. She also interned in a [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=740.9s)]
*  And on Capitol Hill with the senator [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=746.5s)]
*  But other than that there doesn't seem to be much very much political activity going on. She's yeah a Democratic senator [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=749.18s)]
*  And it's very clear that she's really just enjoying [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=755.9s)]
*  Being at college as most of us were [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=760.06s)]
*  When we were in college just enjoying being at college and I don't think the activist streak was very strong then [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=762.0999999999999s)]
*  So I think the the first time that most Americans who are not from California [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=769.5s)]
*  Notice Kamala Harris is during the Kavanaugh hearings, right? But even before that [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=775.18s)]
*  when she won in 2016 she [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=780.66s)]
*  Was sort of the one of the small victories for women at a time when their greatest champion Hillary Clinton was Van Quentin [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=783.66s)]
*  At the time Donald Trump, right? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=790.54s)]
*  And so when she declares victory in 2016 her her race for Senate [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=792.9399999999999s)]
*  She tears up her speech and delivers something entirely different [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=798.54s)]
*  Really trying to inspire and encourage everybody who's watching and vow to be the next great fighter [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=802.3s)]
*  Who's gonna go to Washington DC and sort of stop Donald Trump. That's kind of her her [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=809.02s)]
*  First message and one of the very first things she does was that election campaign [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=814.86s)]
*  Yeah, wow night in [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=818.38s)]
*  November 2016 did she ad-lib that speech? No, I think she and her staff went behind the scenes and rewrote it [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=821.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah very quickly because they saw that things were not going well [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=826.86s)]
*  for the Democratic Party [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=831.1s)]
*  And one of her first things she did when she got to Washington was deliver a big speech at the woman's march [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=833.1s)]
*  And basically saying we are here to fight [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=837.66s)]
*  And so what that was the pink hat march? Yeah, I got caught in that [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=840.86s)]
*  By accident most of us who were in the capital were right? Yeah. Well, I was dry was just driving [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=845.74s)]
*  To the gym to play squash actually [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=851.74s)]
*  All of a sudden it was over [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=854.78s)]
*  My car was surrounded by all these fat ladies in pink hats thinking. I don't know what the you know, I'm [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=856.78s)]
*  From DC. I've been there most of my life and I never seen all these people on 17th street [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=862.62s)]
*  It's one of those days that was very big like some protests. You have to really [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=867.5799999999999s)]
*  Try to sell it as a big protest. No, no that was that was a big march [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=872.86s)]
*  Yeah, and as someone who's really from the bottom of my heart pro women. I just have always really liked women [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=876.46s)]
*  I started to rethink my position on women just [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=878.5400000000001s)]
*  Watching the people at that speech. They were the most physically unattractive [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=882.38s)]
*  unhappy [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=887.9s)]
*  People I think I'd ever seen in my life. I mean they were just really a gruesome bunch [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=889.1800000000001s)]
*  It was like so a lot of like really [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=893.1800000000001s)]
*  Like intelligent feminists from Washington liberal intelligent feminists who are out in the street [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=895.5799999999999s)]
*  So unhappy was like every unhappy chick from bethesda was there [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=899.5799999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like the moms you see at the grocery store just like hate their weak husbands [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=904.14s)]
*  And I just didn't realize that there were a half a million of those people in the area, but there were [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=909.66s)]
*  Yeah, it was very [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=915.26s)]
*  So she spoke at that one time and she was like, oh my god, I'm so sorry [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=916.86s)]
*  I'm so sorry [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=920.06s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=921.58s)]
*  Yeah, it was very uh [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=922.62s)]
*  So she spoke at that. What did she say? Right? She um [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=924.22s)]
*  well, it's very interesting because part of her was still kind of clinging to this idea that [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=927.58s)]
*  uh [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=932.94s)]
*  A regular agenda was a female agenda. She talks about how you want to talk about women's issues [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=933.82s)]
*  I will talk to you about finance. I will talk to you about education [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=939.1800000000001s)]
*  I'm really trying to separate women have something special to add [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=942.5400000000001s)]
*  in those areas? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=945.34s)]
*  Right, it was like she was just trying to say that [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=947.1s)]
*  during the speech she makes the case that [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=949.8000000000001s)]
*  all issues are women's issues. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=952.46s)]
*  What's feminist economics look like? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=954.1s)]
*  Yeah, that was kind of her point, right? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=955.96s)]
*  It's just like, eventually I think because of the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=958.26s)]
*  woman's march, she kind of does sort of slip into [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=961.32s)]
*  this agenda and certainly with the issue of abortion, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=963.94s)]
*  she really kind of embraced that. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=968.6600000000001s)]
*  But yeah, her first speech was- [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=970.7s)]
*  The idea is that women should not have kids. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=971.62s)]
*  Women should have the freedom to kill their children. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=976.78s)]
*  Makes them more powerful. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=981.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=982.8199999999999s)]
*  Does she mention the goddess when she said that? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=984.06s)]
*  No, this is the new Kamala Harris. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=985.9s)]
*  This is what- [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=987.86s)]
*  I somehow feel like the goddess may be inspiring [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=988.6999999999999s)]
*  that position, but I can't prove it. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=990.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=992.06s)]
*  Okay, so she gave a talk at the women's march. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=993.38s)]
*  Jogged by memory, was she a major speaker that day? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=995.62s)]
*  She was one of many. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=999.86s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1001.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, they get all the senators up on the stage [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1002.2600000000001s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1003.58s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1004.4200000000001s)]
*  They each get a couple of minutes. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1005.2600000000001s)]
*  So yeah, as soon as she got to the Senate, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1006.9000000000001s)]
*  she spent a lot of time just clashing with Trump appointees, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1008.2600000000001s)]
*  right, because that's what you do when you first get [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1012.82s)]
*  to the Senate. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1014.4200000000001s)]
*  Right, yeah, for sure. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1015.2600000000001s)]
*  They pick their cabinet and they go through the hearings. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1016.7800000000001s)]
*  Grandstand the confirmations. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1019.98s)]
*  If you can make a splash, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1021.1s)]
*  then you can make a name for yourself. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1022.5s)]
*  And so one of her first things, she torments General Kelly, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1024.06s)]
*  who was widely respected, bi-partisan majority of senators [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1028.94s)]
*  who viewed General Kelly as a true public servant. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1033.8600000000001s)]
*  And she was one of the ones that clashed with him [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1036.54s)]
*  and prosecuted him and basically made a name for herself [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1038.66s)]
*  on all the different appointees. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1043.66s)]
*  And then, yes, then after that, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1045.94s)]
*  it was the whole Jeff Sessions Russia thing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1047.8200000000002s)]
*  She made a big name of herself then, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1052.54s)]
*  grilling Jeff Sessions and getting him to admit [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1054.94s)]
*  that if he's rushed, then he gets nervous. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1058.26s)]
*  And that was a whole big viral moment. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1060.2199999999998s)]
*  You know, with the dawn of C-SPAN, every senator, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1062.6599999999999s)]
*  every congressman is looking for these sort of viral moments [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1066.1399999999999s)]
*  to springboard them into the future. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1071.58s)]
*  And so she really got this reputation as being a fighter, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1074.3s)]
*  someone who could take on the Trump people [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1078.3s)]
*  and make them look foolish. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1082.1399999999999s)]
*  What happened with Kavanaugh? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1086.02s)]
*  Right, with Kavanaugh, it was a time of desperation [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1088.98s)]
*  for the left. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1092.22s)]
*  And for many senators who were thinking about running [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1093.3s)]
*  for president, it was your chance. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1096.7s)]
*  I call it like the Kavanaugh primary. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1098.18s)]
*  Whoever does the best against Kavanaugh [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1100.5s)]
*  is gonna earn the respect from the left [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1104.54s)]
*  as you prepare your run for president. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1107.18s)]
*  So this is creepy, but it's true and it's worth knowing. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1109.62s)]
*  Every time you use the internet, you are being watched. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1113.02s)]
*  You are not alone. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1116.02s)]
*  Private businesses do it, government actors, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1117.66s)]
*  our country and others, all of it. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1120.26s)]
*  Internet traffic, including yours, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1123.1s)]
*  is mined like a precious commodity. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1124.6200000000001s)]
*  It's bought and sold and it's used to manipulate [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1126.42s)]
*  what you think, what you buy and yes, even how you vote. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1128.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a big deal and it's a huge market. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1132.8600000000001s)]
*  Your internet provider can see every single website [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1135.22s)]
*  you visit, all of them. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1137.94s)]
*  And in the United States, they're allowed to sell your data, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1139.54s)]
*  even your browsing history, to the highest bidder. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1141.7s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1144.26s)]
*  And that includes everything you do [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1146.74s)]
*  inside a so-called incognito or private browser window. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1149.3s)]
*  Don't fool yourself, they're watching you always. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1153.3s)]
*  So if you think that should be illegal, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1157.4599999999998s)]
*  obviously we agree with you. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1159.26s)]
*  It should be put out of business, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1160.6999999999998s)]
*  these companies, immediately. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1162.62s)]
*  But in the meantime, you should protect yourself. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1163.9399999999998s)]
*  The way that we do it is with ExpressVPN. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1166.34s)]
*  That's an easy to use app that encrypts and reroutes [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1168.86s)]
*  all your internet traffic through secure servers [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1172.26s)]
*  and you can't see it. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1175.14s)]
*  Because we use ExpressVPN, our internet providers [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1176.94s)]
*  cannot see our browsing history. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1179.94s)]
*  Simply put, we've got nothing to sell [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1181.94s)]
*  because they don't have anything on us. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1184.0200000000002s)]
*  That's important to us, it's probably important to you too. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1186.3000000000002s)]
*  So if you think internet privacy only matters [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1189.22s)]
*  to drug traffickers, people who are doing shady things, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1191.5s)]
*  think again. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1194.7800000000002s)]
*  Privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1195.94s)]
*  No privacy, no freedom. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1198.18s)]
*  And the truth is, we have all seen how activists [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1200.66s)]
*  and power-hungry government actors have tried [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1202.98s)]
*  and succeeded in getting people fired [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1204.86s)]
*  or even thrown in jail for saying the wrong thing [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1207.26s)]
*  or having the wrong opinions. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1209.4199999999998s)]
*  Protecting your personal data is essential. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1211.2199999999998s)]
*  It's the beginning of reclaiming your freedom. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1214.9399999999998s)]
*  ExpressVPN hides your IP address. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1217.4599999999998s)]
*  That's a number that reveals your actual identity [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1221.34s)]
*  on the internet, it's unique. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1223.9799999999998s)]
*  Because we hide our IP address with ExpressVPN, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1226.3s)]
*  data brokers can't use it to build a profile on us [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1229.86s)]
*  to sell off to marketers or other governments [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1232.94s)]
*  or our own government, that happens too. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1235.74s)]
*  By the way, hiding your IP address is really useful [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1238.3s)]
*  when you wanna appear to be somewhere you're not, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1241.5s)]
*  and that's your prerogative, by the way. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1243.18s)]
*  We used it in Moscow to get our reporting [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1244.78s)]
*  out of the country, we've used it around the world. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1247.46s)]
*  We always use it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1249.74s)]
*  You could also use it to access geo-restricted content [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1251.5800000000002s)]
*  from anywhere, so if you're in a country [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1254.46s)]
*  that doesn't allow you to use an app, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1255.9s)]
*  you can with ExpressVPN. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1257.5800000000002s)]
*  ExpressVPN has server locations [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1259.8600000000001s)]
*  in over 100 countries around the world. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1261.38s)]
*  That's like having 100 different passports [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1262.9s)]
*  right on your phone. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1266.0600000000002s)]
*  So I'm not a tech expert, obviously, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1268.98s)]
*  and if I can use it, you can too. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1271.26s)]
*  It's really easy. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1273.38s)]
*  You just tap one button and you're connected. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1274.26s)]
*  They have apps for every device you own [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1276.3000000000002s)]
*  or even potentially own, iPhone, any kind of phone, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1278.3000000000002s)]
*  laptop, tablet, even your smart TV. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1281.26s)]
*  Anything that uses the internet can use ExpressVPN. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1284.5s)]
*  ExpressVPN has been rated number one by CNET, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1288.3000000000002s)]
*  The Verge, and a lot of other tech reviewers. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1291.18s)]
*  We have it, you should too. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1293.66s)]
*  Right now, tuckercarlson.com listeners [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1295.9s)]
*  can get three extra months free at expressvpn.com slash Tucker. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1297.7s)]

*  And so she spent a lot of time interrupting, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1310.22s)]
*  forcing angrily, aggressively, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1313.66s)]
*  pursuing Kavanaugh and trying to get him to trip up. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1321.18s)]
*  If you remember the famous moment [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1324.66s)]
*  when she kind of made up this story, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1326.1000000000001s)]
*  when she's asking about whether or not [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1328.38s)]
*  he ever discussed the Russia case [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1330.8600000000001s)]
*  with any lawyer from this Kasich firm in Washington. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1333.0600000000002s)]
*  And Kavanaugh's being very careful [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1339.5s)]
*  because he doesn't want to be pushed into a perjury trap. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1341.14s)]
*  But he says, you know, I can't think of any. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1344.3s)]
*  Is there a moment that you're thinking about? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1346.54s)]
*  And she's indicating that yes, [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1347.8200000000002s)]
*  there is a moment she's thinking about. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1349.38s)]
*  And she's like, but you're not gonna tell me, are you? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1351.7s)]
*  And Kavanaugh's still being very careful. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1354.0600000000002s)]
*  And it turns out, like, she never had any evidence [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1357.22s)]
*  of this ever happening, but she wanted to get him, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1359.6200000000001s)]
*  wanted to catch him in this moment. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1364.0600000000002s)]
*  And ultimately reporters were kind of surprised [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1366.1000000000001s)]
*  by the end of this great exercise that, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1368.3000000000002s)]
*  oh wow, she has no evidence that he ever met [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1371.22s)]
*  or spoke about the case with the lawyer from this firm. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1374.18s)]
*  But yeah, it was back in the days [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1377.94s)]
*  when anything Russia, Russia, Russia related [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1379.46s)]
*  was hot political news, right? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1381.18s)]
*  If you could ever just smear anybody [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1385.14s)]
*  with the very whiff of Russia, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1387.82s)]
*  that was always considered a great victory, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1390.9s)]
*  which kind of pales in comparison now. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1393.7s)]
*  Yeah, looking back, like the stupidity of that [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1397.06s)]
*  was just awe-inspiring. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1399.58s)]
*  The Kavanaugh thing? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1402.14s)]
*  No, of the Russia stuff. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1402.98s)]
*  It was, the idea that the Trump campaign [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1404.94s)]
*  was colluding with anybody, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1408.5s)]
*  to actually believe that you would have to know nothing [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1412.3799999999999s)]
*  about what the Trump campaign was really like, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1414.5s)]
*  where they were, it was a little disorganized. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1416.26s)]
*  They were not even colluding with each other. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1419.02s)]
*  As you know. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1421.02s)]
*  And there was never, I mean, that was like insane. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1421.94s)]
*  It was evidence-free, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1427.8999999999999s)]
*  Russia was not a threat to the United States. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1430.3s)]
*  There were a couple of other countries [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1432.42s)]
*  that were playing in a huge way in our elections [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1433.62s)]
*  and still are, no one will ever mention them. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1435.6999999999998s)]
*  It's not Russia, to put it mildly. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1437.58s)]
*  Everyone in D.C. knows that. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1440.2199999999998s)]
*  Russia had no role whatsoever in our domestic politics, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1442.26s)]
*  and they had no sort of agenda [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1446.9399999999998s)]
*  that would affect our core interests. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1449.8999999999999s)]
*  So like the whole thing was just nuts, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1451.3s)]
*  and everybody went along with it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1453.8999999999999s)]
*  Everybody went along with it. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1455.9399999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1457.4599999999998s)]
*  Like everybody, just like from the force of repetition, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1458.78s)]
*  just because every channel, every newspaper, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1461.82s)]
*  every day was talking about Russia, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1464.74s)]
*  people were like, you know, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1466.1799999999998s)]
*  I really think there's something there. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1467.02s)]
*  What? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1468.02s)]
*  It just showed how dumb everybody was. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1468.86s)]
*  They're all just herd animals, including friends of mine, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1470.74s)]
*  for whom I lost a lot of respect. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1473.5s)]
*  I was like, okay, I'm open-minded. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1475.06s)]
*  I'm kind of agnostic on Russia, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1477.3s)]
*  and I'm willing to believe anything. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1479.3799999999999s)]
*  So where's the evidence? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1481.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1484.34s)]
*  Did you know, do you remember this? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1485.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1486.02s)]
*  And it was always very puzzling [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1487.3799999999999s)]
*  because it started from this dossier, right, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1489.46s)]
*  that they always had in their back pocket, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1492.02s)]
*  but didn't use it during 2016 [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1493.7s)]
*  because they didn't think they had to. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1495.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1497.22s)]
*  But once Trump won, it was the first thing [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1498.0600000000002s)]
*  that they pulled out of their pockets. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1499.6200000000001s)]
*  They're like, wow, we can actually use this. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1500.9s)]
*  Was Harris big on the Russia thing? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1502.74s)]
*  Not too much. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1505.1000000000001s)]
*  She prosecuted different Trump officials. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1506.7s)]
*  She did get Bill Barr one time, you know, [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1510.7s)]
*  asking him if Trump had ever asked him [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1513.54s)]
*  to sort of stop the investigation, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1516.18s)]
*  and he found himself sort of fumbling for words [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1518.86s)]
*  and couldn't really answer the question. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1522.86s)]
*  So she did have some good moments there, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1524.86s)]
*  but yeah, I think a lot of it was just, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1526.74s)]
*  she was seen as somebody who was fighting. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1529.02s)]
*  She had this opposing, you know, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1531.26s)]
*  she was fighting something else, right? [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1533.86s)]
*  And then people placed that excitement [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1536.62s)]
*  because she was the one doing the fighting [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1539.98s)]
*  against this force that they were very unhappy about. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1541.54s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1544.74s)]
*  So how did, if you were to summarize [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1545.66s)]
*  how she behaved during the Kavanaugh hearings, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1548.14s)]
*  I mean, I think I remember her going all in [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1552.78s)]
*  on the rape stuff or sexual assault stuff. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1555.26s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1558.18s)]
*  She was very, very adamant about supporting [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1559.78s)]
*  Christine Belazze Ford, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1562.58s)]
*  and it was also around the Me Too movement, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1563.82s)]
*  She was very, she honed in on that [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1565.7s)]
*  as a political force that would help her. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1569.26s)]
*  So when it came to that, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1571.82s)]
*  she was just very intent on pushing Christine Belazze Ford [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1574.5s)]
*  as this hero, as this patriot. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1579.74s)]
*  You know, she repeatedly claimed that she believed her [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1582.46s)]
*  when she first spoke, before she even met her. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1585.78s)]
*  She repeatedly said that, you know, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1589.26s)]
*  she was a patriot and a hero for coming forward. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1591.18s)]
*  And she really thought that this was the moment [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1594.46s)]
*  that she could really push through and stop Kavanaugh. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1596.9s)]
*  You know, Democrats didn't have much to go on. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1599.78s)]
*  But when they found out that Dianne Feinstein [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1602.54s)]
*  had this letter from Christine Ford, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1605.22s)]
*  who wished to remain anonymous, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1607.94s)]
*  different, you know, she confronted Feinstein [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1611.54s)]
*  about the letter, like, you better address this. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1613.7s)]
*  Once reports started leaking out [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1615.74s)]
*  about the existence of this letter, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1617.38s)]
*  she confronted Feinstein and said, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1618.94s)]
*  you better address this, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1620.78s)]
*  or it's gonna look real ugly for you. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1621.78s)]
*  So Feinstein was eventually forced out [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1624.14s)]
*  to make this letter public, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1626.42s)]
*  to bring them, to bring her into the conversation, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1628.26s)]
*  even though she wanted to remain anonymous. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1631.18s)]
*  And so this woman was ultimately pulled into the fight. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1633.66s)]
*  And senators and Senate staff who were, went through that. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1637.26s)]
*  It was a very tough time for a lot of people in the Senate. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1640.98s)]
*  Whatever happened, so Christine Belazze Ford, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1643.94s)]
*  this is all coming back to me, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1646.02s)]
*  it was, there was a high school party in Bethesda, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1647.54s)]
*  and it always starts in Bethesda, doesn't it? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1650.74s)]
*  And, which is a suburb of DC, of course, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1653.14s)]
*  in Maryland, Montgomery County. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1657.22s)]
*  And, and Kavanaugh supposedly at this high school party, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1658.74s)]
*  40, 35 years before had acted badly [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1665.5800000000002s)]
*  and sexually assaulted Christine Belazze Ford. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1668.5800000000002s)]
*  Is that, that was the core allegation? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1670.66s)]
*  Right, right, that was her. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1671.5s)]
*  So then Belazze Ford basically destroyed her life, correct? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1673.66s)]
*  Right, you know, maybe she's still [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1678.3s)]
*  a progressive hero among some, but you certainly, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1680.98s)]
*  we've seen this story before, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1684.42s)]
*  where the Democrats will pull an unsuspecting character [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1685.74s)]
*  to weaponize against the Republican party [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1689.26s)]
*  and then just sort of cast them aside when it's all over. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1692.18s)]
*  Well, exactly, nicely put. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1694.6200000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right, like whatever happened, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1696.22s)]
*  Christine Belazze Ford is no longer a hero, right? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1698.06s)]
*  Like George Floyd, it's like she was useful [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1703.38s)]
*  for a news cycle, they upended her life, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1706.78s)]
*  and then I don't think they've named any [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1711.02s)]
*  doubt chairs after her since. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1714.86s)]
*  Makes me think of all the moms who lost their sons in Iraq, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1716.3s)]
*  how they were weaponized and held up as paragons of, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1719.78s)]
*  you know, this is why the Bush administration is evil, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1723.34s)]
*  because we have this poor woman [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1725.74s)]
*  who's suffering the loss of her son. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1727.1799999999998s)]
*  They would hoist them up and bring them [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1728.9399999999998s)]
*  to all the speeches and then. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1730.62s)]
*  Yeah, and now all those moms are against. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1731.9799999999998s)]
*  The moms who have hostages is in, you know, Israel. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1734.02s)]
*  No, it's totally right. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1737.4199999999998s)]
*  They brought them on stage and then it turns out, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1738.26s)]
*  oh, we can't help your child who's being held hostage. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1740.3s)]
*  We weren't able to help them either, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1745.6200000000001s)]
*  but we were able to use them politically to. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1747.1s)]
*  It's funny, all those Iraq moms [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1749.98s)]
*  who were marching against Trump, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1751.66s)]
*  I mean, rather against Bush, they all had my sympathy, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1753.7s)]
*  speaking for myself, but they, you know, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1757.34s)]
*  now the Democratic Party that once, you know, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1760.58s)]
*  promoted them and called them heroes [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1765.06s)]
*  is aligned with Dick Cheney and his repulsive little daughter. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1767.22s)]
*  Right, you still have. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1771.14s)]
*  You know, like whatever happened. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1773.3799999999999s)]
*  You still have remnants of the code pink out there. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1774.62s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1777.06s)]
*  They certainly aren't the champions that they. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1777.8999999999999s)]
*  No, I'm on their side. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1779.5s)]
*  We're no longer hailing them as the champions [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1780.5s)]
*  of truth and justice. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1783.26s)]
*  Sorry to digress, Charlie, but it's just interesting. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1784.3799999999999s)]
*  You're bringing up those things I've forgotten about. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1786.98s)]
*  It is an interesting time to revisit, for sure. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1788.98s)]
*  So, but Kamala Harris becomes more a national figure [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1791.74s)]
*  after falsely accusing. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1794.6599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1797.06s)]
*  Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault four years ago. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1797.8999999999999s)]
*  Is that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1800.6999999999998s)]
*  I believe, believe all women, believe the victims. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1801.54s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1804.98s)]
*  This whole Me Too movement that was kind of around 2018, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1805.82s)]
*  I believe. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1809.86s)]
*  17, 18. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1810.7s)]
*  Right around the time that Kavanaugh was sort of brought up [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1811.54s)]
*  and the entire movement was kind of leveraged [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1813.82s)]
*  in this whole thing where it's like believe all women [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1817.06s)]
*  and that's our new platform for the Democratic Party. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1820.6599999999999s)]
*  So women don't lie ever? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1823.5s)]
*  No, especially about this. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1825.74s)]
*  Because they're Hindu goddesses or something. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1828.18s)]
*  Incatable of lying. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1830.54s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1831.86s)]
*  I don't know about that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1832.7s)]
*  It's funny to find out that 51% of the population [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1833.54s)]
*  just doesn't lie. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1835.74s)]
*  Everything they say is just gospel. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1836.6599999999999s)]
*  It's just true. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1838.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, you're supposed to because, you know, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1838.98s)]
*  that's the, those are the new marching orders. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1841.3799999999999s)]
*  Only it turns out that it didn't go so well. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1843.8999999999999s)]
*  Does that apply to Candace Owens [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1846.74s)]
*  or just Christine Blasey Ford? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1848.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1851.62s)]
*  Just. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1852.46s)]
*  I mean, it's all, it's just funny to look back. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1853.3s)]
*  I'm sorry, I keep interrupting you, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1856.3s)]
*  but it's just funny to look back. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1857.34s)]
*  It's like a time capsule. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1859.14s)]
*  You remember these moments and in retrospect, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1860.8200000000002s)]
*  they're so completely absurd. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1863.26s)]
*  It's hard to believe that Martha Raditz and Joe Scarborough [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1866.0200000000002s)]
*  and all these other supposedly educated people [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1868.94s)]
*  are saying this stuff with a straight face on television. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1870.94s)]
*  Well, especially the Me Too movement. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1873.7800000000002s)]
*  Believe all women? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1875.3000000000002s)]
*  Are you joking? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1876.46s)]
*  No. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1877.3000000000002s)]
*  Come on, no. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1878.14s)]
*  Kamala Harris. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1878.98s)]
*  And Kamala Harris was one of the first to see this [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1879.8200000000002s)]
*  as like a politically avantages position [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1883.7s)]
*  to take the Me Too movement. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1886.14s)]
*  So there's video of her marching in San Francisco [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1887.42s)]
*  at a parade championing the Me Too movement. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1891.42s)]
*  And who's along with her noted celebrity, Jussie Smollett. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1894.5s)]
*  Not really. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1899.46s)]
*  He is also right beside her in a Me Too shirt. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1901.22s)]
*  Juicy Smollett was a Me Too-er also? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1904.02s)]
*  Was a Me Too-er. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1906.14s)]
*  Back in 2018 and they're both chanting, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1907.8600000000001s)]
*  up, up with education, down, down with deportation. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1911.8200000000002s)]
*  So they're also protesting. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1915.5s)]
*  You know you're making this up, Charlie. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1916.6999999999998s)]
*  They're also protesting immigration [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1918.86s)]
*  wearing Me Too movement gear. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1920.3799999999999s)]
*  But what's interesting about that, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1923.3s)]
*  and if you look at the Me Too movement as a political force, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1924.86s)]
*  look at what they did to Al Franken. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1928.1s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1932.62s)]
*  He was one of the first democratic victims of the Me Too. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1933.4599999999998s)]
*  I defended him. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1936.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1937.34s)]
*  He wouldn't defend himself. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1938.1799999999998s)]
*  He's such a cuck, he wouldn't even defend himself. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1939.02s)]
*  He did nothing wrong. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1940.6999999999998s)]
*  Oh, right. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1941.74s)]
*  So he was a rising political star. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1942.58s)]
*  People were actively, he had just published a book. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1946.9399999999998s)]
*  People were actively talking about him as, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1949.4199999999998s)]
*  maybe he's the answer to Donald Trump. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1951.5s)]
*  He found this populist movement in Minnesota [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1953.22s)]
*  that pretty much vanquished the Republican Party [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1955.58s)]
*  and the state. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1957.74s)]
*  And was this like awkward, weird anti-Trump, right? [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1959.1799999999998s)]
*  And so people were actively talking about him [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1963.6999999999998s)]
*  as a possible presidential candidate. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1965.62s)]
*  But then when these allegations start coming out [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1968.6599999999999s)]
*  about his behavior, who were the first ones to seize on it? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1973.3400000000001s)]
*  All the democratic women senators [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1976.1000000000001s)]
*  who were also interested in running [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1978.98s)]
*  a presidential campaign. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1980.3s)]
*  I think it was Christian Gillibrand [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1982.5s)]
*  that fired the first shot. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1984.74s)]
*  She's the worst. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1985.78s)]
*  Not her real name, by the way. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1987.06s)]
*  I can't remember her real name. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1988.8600000000001s)]
*  No, it's all fake. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1990.02s)]
*  I wish I could remember her real name, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1993.14s)]
*  but it's not even close to Kirsten Gillibrand. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1994.38s)]
*  But anyway. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1996.82s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, they're all. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=1999.54s)]
*  Klobuchar did that? [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2002.1399999999999s)]
*  They all band together and march to Schumer's office [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2003.4599999999998s)]
*  and say he's gotta go. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2006.74s)]
*  And he actually obeyed them. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2009.1799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2012.1s)]
*  Well, him and all his colleagues were, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2012.9399999999998s)]
*  when Schumer pulls them into the office and says, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2016.02s)]
*  I can't defend you, I can't fight for you, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2017.9399999999998s)]
*  what are you gonna do? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2021.1s)]
*  Are you gonna fight for yourself [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2023.2199999999998s)]
*  and go be raked over the coals for the rest of your life? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2025.1799999999998s)]
*  Or do you just go away quietly? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2028.58s)]
*  It seems in Franken's case, he didn't wanna fight. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2031.18s)]
*  I know Franken well and have known him for 25 years. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2035.06s)]
*  Yeah, he was a pretty clever guy, has good qualities. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2038.82s)]
*  People in the Senate always had good things to say. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2043.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I never hated Al Franken, [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2045.1s)]
*  but he was ultimately all he really cared about [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2046.8999999999999s)]
*  was left-wing ideology and just such a sad. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2049.42s)]
*  And being liked. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2052.22s)]
*  Broken guy, yeah. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2053.06s)]
*  And being liked. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2053.94s)]
*  But again, charming guy, talented guy, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  more talented than most US senators for sure, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2057.98s)]
*  but so weak inside. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2060.78s)]
*  Sure. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2063.42s)]
*  I think bossed around by his wife, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2064.26s)]
*  that was always my impression, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2065.26s)]
*  Franny from Portland, Maine, as I recall. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2066.42s)]
*  But the point is he didn't do anything wrong. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2068.42s)]
*  And if he had just ridden it out for a week [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2072.94s)]
*  and just let it, just hunker down, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2077.5s)]
*  go to Barbados for a week, come back, he'd be fine. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2080.06s)]
*  He was an elected United States Senator. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2082.42s)]
*  And he gave up his seat voluntarily [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2084.54s)]
*  because four ambitious girls didn't like him. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2086.1s)]
*  I mean, wow, what a loser. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2088.7s)]
*  I mean, are you serious? [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2092.38s)]
*  Right, you would certainly expect. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2095.46s)]
*  And more people started fighting back ultimately. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2097.2999999999997s)]
*  But at the time they were very afraid of the movement. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2099.58s)]
*  It was very much a- [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2101.94s)]
*  But can you imagine if you were Al Franken [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2102.7799999999997s)]
*  and you just dishonor yourself and your family, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2104.14s)]
*  your kids are ashamed, you go down in history [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2107.46s)]
*  as some sort of sexual assaulter, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2110.2599999999998s)]
*  some sort of crypto rapist, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2113.1s)]
*  you give up your own Senate seat [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2114.66s)]
*  that you really fought hard for [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2116.46s)]
*  just because Kirsten Gillibrand [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2118.42s)]
*  or whatever her real name is, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2120.66s)]
*  wants what you have, can you imagine? [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2122.9s)]
*  The regret he must feel. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2125.82s)]
*  Right, and I think a lot of Democratic donors [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2127.58s)]
*  were not happy with that. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2130.34s)]
*  Certainly with Gillibrand, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2131.58s)]
*  a lot of Democratic donors were not happy. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2132.9s)]
*  She ran for president in Iowa, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2135.14s)]
*  kind of ended very shortly afterwards [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2137.46s)]
*  because Democratic donors were still furious at her [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2139.14s)]
*  for taking Franken off the table. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2142.18s)]
*  Completely false person. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2143.3s)]
*  I'd take Carmella Harris any day over Kirsten Gillibrand. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2144.58s)]
*  Oh really? [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2147.34s)]
*  There's something about Gillibrand that's just really, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2148.18s)]
*  she's just- [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2151.9s)]
*  New Yorker. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2152.74s)]
*  So ruthless, oh my gosh. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2153.58s)]
*  You have to be. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2155.74s)]
*  That's fascinating. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2156.58s)]
*  So Harris joined the chorus against Al Franken. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2157.9s)]
*  Right, at the same time she has somebody in her office [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2164.7s)]
*  that is also under investigation for his own Me Too stuff [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2168.58s)]
*  when he was back in California. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2175.22s)]
*  So someone in her close circle, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2176.42s)]
*  I don't wanna get his name wrong, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2179.58s)]
*  but it was somebody very close [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2180.9s)]
*  who was being investigated by the justice system [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2183.9s)]
*  in California. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2189.2999999999997s)]
*  They ultimately had, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2191.7s)]
*  he was sued by a woman for inappropriate behavior [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2193.5s)]
*  and they eventually had to award this woman a big payout [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2196.9s)]
*  because of things that he had done to her in his office, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2201.02s)]
*  in his previous job. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2204.7000000000003s)]
*  When Carmella Harris is informed about it, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2207.54s)]
*  she has no idea, she's shocked. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2209.14s)]
*  I had no idea that this was even happening. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2212.02s)]
*  Well, if he was currently having this case being taken [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2215.5s)]
*  that was already underway [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2220.34s)]
*  by all the rules of the Me Too movement, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2222.2200000000003s)]
*  you're supposed to get rid of this person [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2223.86s)]
*  as soon as you hear about it. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2224.98s)]
*  Execute him, yeah, of course. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2226.42s)]
*  But to have someone on her staff [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2228.1000000000004s)]
*  who was involved in this whole situation [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2230.9s)]
*  and then suddenly claim ignorance when the ruling is issued [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2234.7400000000002s)]
*  really doesn't pass the smell test. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2238.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, also, I mean, Carmella Harris got her job [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2240.82s)]
*  because she was having sex with a married older man, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2243.42s)]
*  Willie Brown, and then she was Montel Williams' side piece. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2246.86s)]
*  So it's like, I'd love to know her actual perspective [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2250.1400000000003s)]
*  on sexual politics. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2253.3s)]
*  She's a little bit different from maybe what she's saying. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2254.7s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2257.2999999999997s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2258.14s)]
*  I mean, if there's one anti-feminist [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2259.9399999999996s)]
*  in the state of California, it's Willie Brown. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2261.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2263.66s)]
*  Although he very much loved to see himself as a feminist. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2264.5s)]
*  No, but in real life. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2268.5s)]
*  But he would host these events that featured only women. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2270.74s)]
*  And he would talk about how these were [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2275.18s)]
*  great woman empowerment summits. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2277.9399999999996s)]
*  I think they're known as ladies. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2280.1s)]
*  For one thing. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2281.8999999999996s)]
*  And second, like, look, I like Willie Brown. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2282.9s)]
*  I'm not attacking Willie Brown. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2285.26s)]
*  I think he's hilarious. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2286.46s)]
*  Cause I think he's a little bit more honest. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2287.82s)]
*  But like, if there's anybody whose life violates [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2289.1800000000003s)]
*  the principles of second wave feminism, it's Willie Brown. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2294.9s)]
*  I mean, honest, I mean, really. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2298.82s)]
*  Willie Brown? [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2300.94s)]
*  Right, I think that's right. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2302.98s)]
*  It's like, it's like. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2304.62s)]
*  Even Bill Clinton described him as the real slick Willie. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2306.14s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2308.9s)]
*  Did he really say that? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2310.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2311.26s)]
*  Oh, that's so good. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2313.02s)]
*  Now you're making me like them both. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2313.86s)]
*  Cause I, you know, you just like flashes of honesty [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2314.7s)]
*  wherever you find them. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2316.46s)]
*  Right, Willie Brown was this character [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2317.3s)]
*  in California politics that couldn't be brought down [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2319.06s)]
*  by corruption, but he always, he was always teasing [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2321.1s)]
*  and joking about corruption. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2323.9s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, if you're having sex with Willie Brown [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2325.38s)]
*  in order to get a job, you know, whatever, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2328.06s)]
*  you can deal with your own conscience [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2331.06s)]
*  and with your own Hindu goddess on that, you know? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2333.22s)]
*  But you definitely can't lecture me on feminism [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2336.38s)]
*  if you've done that. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2338.9s)]
*  I think it's fair to say, right? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2339.74s)]
*  I think so. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2341.66s)]
*  I think when you talk to women, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2342.5s)]
*  they would agree with that statement. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2343.94s)]
*  Right, you know, you give up your, you gain a lot. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2345.2599999999998s)]
*  You get to be attorney general in the state of California [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2348.34s)]
*  and the US Senator and Vice President, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2350.22s)]
*  but you do give up your right to lecture me about feminism. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2352.22s)]
*  Right. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2355.94s)]
*  Is that fair? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2356.7799999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of women would agree with that. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2357.62s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2358.46s)]
*  I'm just being, I'm not judging. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2359.2999999999997s)]
*  Sure. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2361.02s)]
*  But she's not allowed to judge either. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2361.86s)]
*  I guess that's what I'm saying. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2364.2999999999997s)]
*  It's certainly not without evidence, right? [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2365.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2367.9s)]
*  It's like, that was the whole. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2368.74s)]
*  Sorry, you had sex with Willie Brown to get a job, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2369.58s)]
*  so why don't you cool it on the feminism stuff? [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2370.86s)]
*  As you discussed with a previous guest, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2374.54s)]
*  like it kicked off her entire career. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2376.58s)]
*  Oh, of course it did. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2378.9s)]
*  It wasn't just that. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2379.7400000000002s)]
*  It was, you know, Willie Brown gave her positions of power [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2380.58s)]
*  on state boards, gave her that paid handsomely. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2384.1s)]
*  You know, she made up to $400,000 back in the 90s [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2387.1400000000003s)]
*  from these positions. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2390.94s)]
*  Can you be specific about which positions? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2391.78s)]
*  Uninsured, I just think it was. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2393.78s)]
*  Just kidding, Charlie, now I'm getting vulgar again. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2395.6200000000003s)]
*  Do it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2398.46s)]
*  Oh, I see, yeah. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2399.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, yeah, and then she made, so she made about $400,000 [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2400.14s)]
*  over a couple of years just from these once a month [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2404.18s)]
*  state board positions, and that's like, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2406.46s)]
*  you adjust that for today's dollars. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2408.7799999999997s)]
*  That's like almost a million dollars. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2410.7s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2411.94s)]
*  And then bought her a BMW, helped pay for her wardrobe, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2413.06s)]
*  really turned her in to Kamala Harris. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2419.2599999999998s)]
*  So there are two ways to look at this, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2421.74s)]
*  and as a charitable man who instinctively likes women [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2423.66s)]
*  and likes kind of plucky up from the bootstrap stories, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2426.82s)]
*  I think you could tell that story in an honest way [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2430.94s)]
*  that might make you admire Kamala Harris. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2433.7000000000003s)]
*  Here's this woman who doesn't know anybody. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2436.0600000000004s)]
*  She's from Canada. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2438.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, she doesn't, she's not from the area really. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2440.26s)]
*  She's, I think, from Oakland. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2444.1400000000003s)]
*  She was working at the Alameda County Prosecutor's Office. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2445.2200000000003s)]
*  Exactly, right, in the East Bay. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2448.38s)]
*  And she winds up becoming attorney general [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2450.82s)]
*  of the biggest state, and she's willing to do [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2452.82s)]
*  whatever it takes to get that, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2454.82s)]
*  including have sex with Willie Brown and Monta Williams. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2456.1800000000003s)]
*  If you told a story that way, I'd say, well, you know, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2458.82s)]
*  morally it's obviously malodorous, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2463.06s)]
*  but on the other hand, this woman has a lot of energy. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2467.26s)]
*  She's focused. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2473.6200000000003s)]
*  She does what it takes to get what she wants. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2474.86s)]
*  Exactly right, and she's totally self-made. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2476.7400000000002s)]
*  And I think Willie Brown really opened her up [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2479.7000000000003s)]
*  to this world of the possibilities. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2482.3s)]
*  For sure. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2484.3s)]
*  If you're a young prosecutor at the age of 29, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2485.1400000000003s)]
*  you see what's possible, but being on the arm [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2487.34s)]
*  of Willie Brown. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2490.0600000000004s)]
*  You said I have sex with Willie Brown. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2491.26s)]
*  Why wouldn't you look at that and say, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2493.1400000000003s)]
*  I can seize this for myself, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2494.5800000000004s)]
*  as long as I show up and demand it? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2496.6200000000003s)]
*  And Willie Brown taught her how to do that. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2498.78s)]
*  He talks about it in his book, like, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2500.78s)]
*  in order to get into wealthy white worlds, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2502.6200000000003s)]
*  you force your way into these positions of influence, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2506.5800000000004s)]
*  like on museum boards and the arts and the charities, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2510.58s)]
*  and you present yourself as this figure, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2515.14s)]
*  then they'll welcome you into these worlds [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2519.22s)]
*  and they'll hoist you up onto these political platforms. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2520.74s)]
*  Okay, that's all fine, I get it. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2524.74s)]
*  I mean, it's a form of prostitution, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2526.5s)]
*  but I try not to judge. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2528.06s)]
*  All I'm saying is why would you be self-righteous [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2530.62s)]
*  and scolding if she has no right to be self-righteous [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2534.14s)]
*  about anything or scold anyone? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2538.06s)]
*  And she doesn't need to. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2542.2599999999998s)]
*  By the way, she could just, I don't know, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2543.2599999999998s)]
*  tell her story honestly, and people might say, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2544.82s)]
*  I would say, yeah, I kind of get it. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2546.74s)]
*  She made something out of not much and I admire that. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2548.5s)]
*  Why does she have to lecture the rest of us [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2551.58s)]
*  about the civil rights movement? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2553.18s)]
*  Right, it's because it's politically advantageous [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2554.98s)]
*  at this point, we kind of see that. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2557.2599999999998s)]
*  But it's disgusting. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2558.62s)]
*  We've told you before about Hallow. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2560.14s)]
*  It is a great app that I am proud to say I use, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2562.42s)]
*  my whole family uses, it's for daily prayer [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2566.14s)]
*  and Christian meditation, and it's transformative. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2568.06s)]
*  As we head into the start of school [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2571.66s)]
*  and the height of election season, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2572.9s)]
*  you need it, trust me, we all do. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2574.94s)]
*  Things are gonna get crazier and crazier and crazier. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2576.86s)]
*  Sometimes it's hard to imagine even what is coming next. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2579.7s)]
*  So with everything happening in the world right now, [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2583.18s)]
*  it is essential to ground yourself. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2585.74s)]
*  This is not some quack cure. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2589.2599999999998s)]
*  This is the oldest and most reliable cure in history. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2592.38s)]
*  It's prayer. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2595.86s)]
*  Ground yourself in prayer and scripture every single day. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2597.1s)]
*  That is a prerequisite for staying sane and healthy [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2599.86s)]
*  and maybe for doing better eternally. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2603.46s)]
*  So if you're busy on the road, headed to kids' sports, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2606.06s)]
*  there's always time to pray and reflect alone [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2608.26s)]
*  or as a family, but it's hard to be organized about it. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2610.9s)]
*  Building a foundation of prayer [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2614.6600000000003s)]
*  is gonna be absolutely critical as we head into November, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2615.98s)]
*  praying that God's will is done in this country [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2618.58s)]
*  and that peace and healing come to us [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2621.2200000000003s)]
*  here in the United States and around the world. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2624.26s)]
*  Christianity obviously is under attack everywhere. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2625.98s)]
*  That's not an accident. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2630.46s)]
*  Why is Christianity, the most peaceful of all religions, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2631.6600000000003s)]
*  under attack globally? [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2634.26s)]
*  Did you see the opening of the Paris Olympics? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2635.7000000000003s)]
*  There's a reason, because the battle is not temporal, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2637.78s)]
*  it's taking place in the unseen world. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2640.86s)]
*  It's a spiritual battle, obviously. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2643.5s)]
*  So try Hallow, get three months completely free at Hallow. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2646.34s)]
*  That's Hallow.com slash Tucker. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2649.5400000000004s)]
*  If there's ever a time to get spiritually in tune [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2652.78s)]
*  and ground yourself in prayer, it's now. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2655.2200000000003s)]
*  Hallow will help personally and strongly [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2657.9s)]
*  and totally sincerely recommend it. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2661.1400000000003s)]
*  Hallow.com slash Tucker. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2663.1800000000003s)]
*  But that's democratic politics. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2665.34s)]
*  Shut up, honey, you're from Canada. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2667.2200000000003s)]
*  Stop telling me that the Edmund Pettus Bridge, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2669.02s)]
*  like you got nothing to do with that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2671.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. No? [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2672.5s)]
*  Right. But she's not from Alabama, right? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2674.1000000000004s)]
*  No. No. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2676.1800000000003s)]
*  She definitely embraced this agenda as her own. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2678.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2683.18s)]
*  Embraced her identity. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2684.14s)]
*  If anybody questions her identity, she's just like, [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2685.22s)]
*  I'm not even gonna take the time [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2688.42s)]
*  to discuss this with you. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2689.7s)]
*  If you have a problem with me being black, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2692.42s)]
*  that's your problem. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2694.18s)]
*  Being black? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2695.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, so black. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2697.5s)]
*  Oh, it's hilarious. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2699.02s)]
*  Right, and when you talk to black women in politics, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2699.8599999999997s)]
*  they know, but they also see her [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2705.58s)]
*  as someone who could do the job. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2708.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just so fake. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2710.98s)]
*  So she did a Bret Baer show the other night. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2712.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2716.54s)]
*  It's the first interview I've ever seen [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2717.7s)]
*  where after the interview, everyone tells you, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2719.66s)]
*  ignore all the substance of everything she said [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2722.62s)]
*  and focus only on the style. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2725.8599999999997s)]
*  All of her defenders are focusing on the style. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2727.2999999999997s)]
*  Wow, just the fact that she did this interview, she won. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2730.22s)]
*  Whereas. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2733.94s)]
*  Do an interview with a Bret Baer that's so mean. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2734.78s)]
*  It's all so stupid, but I didn't read any of the coverage [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2737.38s)]
*  of it because the lesson was obvious for me. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2740.82s)]
*  I didn't need to be told what the lesson was, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2743.54s)]
*  but I was really struck by how angry and touchy she was, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2745.02s)]
*  defensive she was, nasty she was, skillless she was. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2750.26s)]
*  You've seen a million of her interviews. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2755.38s)]
*  Is that a theme that you've noticed in the past? [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2757.14s)]
*  This is something that was very much a product [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2759.82s)]
*  that sort of booster on the public stage, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2762.06s)]
*  which is why she's trying to repeat it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2763.74s)]
*  She had a better than expected debate against Donald Trump [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2765.98s)]
*  because she was able to tangle with him [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2769.02s)]
*  and demonstrate that she could go toe to toe. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2771.82s)]
*  Pretty good job, not bad. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2774.14s)]
*  Right, she needed that, the opposition force [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2776.18s)]
*  to campaign against, like she needs Trump. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2780.22s)]
*  If she doesn't have Trump, what does she have? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2783.82s)]
*  And so I think that that was part of the calculus [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2786.2599999999998s)]
*  of doing the Fox News interview. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2788.38s)]
*  It's like, if I can just go against something [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2789.7s)]
*  and if I can just stand tall [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2793.02s)]
*  and get in a fight with Brett Baer, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2794.02s)]
*  then I look better by comparison. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2796.22s)]
*  I just look like a total asshole. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2797.86s)]
*  I mean, that was just my view. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2799.46s)]
*  I mean, I don't know, maybe I'm completely out of it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2800.5s)]
*  I, you know, there's nothing new with her gender. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2803.14s)]
*  She just was like screechy and defensive and mad. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2805.38s)]
*  Is she, have you seen other interviews like that with her? [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2809.62s)]
*  Is that what she always is? [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2811.94s)]
*  It's very interesting because, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2813.06s)]
*  and I talk about this in the book a lot, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2814.62s)]
*  is when she was sort of this like, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2816.2599999999998s)]
*  Democratic champion in the Senate [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2820.22s)]
*  where she was known for repeatedly fighting [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2822.7000000000003s)]
*  and getting angry and doing her utmost to crush Kavanaugh. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2824.1400000000003s)]
*  I think she realized at some point [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2829.1400000000003s)]
*  that if I'm gonna run for president, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2830.38s)]
*  I need to like be sort of a little more [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2831.82s)]
*  than just this opposing force. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2834.46s)]
*  I need to have an idea, an identity [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2836.6600000000003s)]
*  that attracts Americans to vote for me for president. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2839.58s)]
*  And so that's when she introduces this concept [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2845.1s)]
*  of a joyful warrior. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2848.42s)]
*  She makes a hard pivot away from the fighter [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2850.14s)]
*  and goes on Ellen and delivers this elegant soliloquy [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2853.3799999999997s)]
*  about the importance of being a joyful warrior [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2857.8599999999997s)]
*  and about loving your country and fighting for your country [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2859.98s)]
*  and not being angry all the time. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2862.54s)]
*  She had multiple interviews where she's like, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2863.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm tired of being mad all the time [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2865.8599999999997s)]
*  and I want to be a joyful warrior. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2868.58s)]
*  Did she use the phrase joyful warrior? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2871.3399999999997s)]
*  Repeatedly, repeatedly. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2873.2599999999998s)]
*  On Ellen in magazine profiles, she completely, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2875.66s)]
*  this is actually before Kavanaugh [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2880.62s)]
*  because she has this reputation [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2882.42s)]
*  of being a fighter in the Senate. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2883.9s)]
*  Then she pivots to be a joyful warrior around 2018. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2885.46s)]
*  Then she pivots back to the vengeful warrior [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2889.7400000000002s)]
*  when she's fighting Kavanaugh. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2893.06s)]
*  And then by the time she's ready to announce [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2895.06s)]
*  her campaign for president in 2019, early 2019, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2897.14s)]
*  she sort of pivots back to this idea [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2901.5s)]
*  that I'm a joyful warrior [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2903.42s)]
*  and all I care about is speaking truth. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2905.2200000000003s)]
*  Joyful, so you've looked pretty closely at her life. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2907.06s)]
*  You just wrote a book about her. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2909.94s)]
*  How many instances did you stumble across of joy? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2911.7s)]
*  True, genuine joy, very hard to find, very hard to find. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2915.2999999999997s)]
*  She's very guarded. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2918.54s)]
*  She's a very private person [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2920.98s)]
*  and she's uncomfortable talking about herself. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2922.2999999999997s)]
*  She talks about it all the time. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2924.18s)]
*  She's just like, I'm just not comfortable [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2925.66s)]
*  talking about myself. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2927.38s)]
*  But she never stops talking about herself, I notice. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2928.2999999999997s)]
*  Except in the specific ways, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2930.7s)]
*  like being raised in a middle-class family, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2933.54s)]
*  being the product of her community. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2935.86s)]
*  What community is she talking about? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2938.5s)]
*  Right, the San Francisco community. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2940.1800000000003s)]
*  But she's from Canada. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2942.1000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2943.98s)]
*  Like what the hell is she talking about? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2944.82s)]
*  As a politician, when she's talking about the community, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2945.6600000000003s)]
*  she's talking about her childhood community [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2947.78s)]
*  that she grew up in, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2949.98s)]
*  leaving the Canada part out entirely [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2951.3s)]
*  and then just pretending she's always been from Oakland, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2953.34s)]
*  which she's actually from Berkeley, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2957.06s)]
*  but she doesn't like to talk about it. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2959.02s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, what, yeah. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2963.42s)]
*  I am from that area, so I know it well. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2966.22s)]
*  And there are no black people there. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2968.42s)]
*  I don't even know what she's talking about. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2971.1s)]
*  In San Francisco, no. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2972.94s)]
*  There's like one and a half black neighborhoods, [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2975.06s)]
*  tiny percentage of the population. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2977.66s)]
*  I think San Francisco- [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2979.54s)]
*  Well, she is the daughter of an academic elite, right? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2980.38s)]
*  Her father and mother- [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2983.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Jamaican guy too, right? [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2984.1s)]
*  Right, her father and mother [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2985.2599999999998s)]
*  were sort of hard left academics. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2986.34s)]
*  They were not necessarily the marching and shouters. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2990.66s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure they went to a few protests, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2992.86s)]
*  but they were very much intellectual activists. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2994.9s)]
*  They were very focused on- [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2997.2200000000003s)]
*  Can I ask, is, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=2998.06s)]
*  her father attacked her at one point, didn't he? [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3000.42s)]
*  Right, and this is for using her Jamaican identity [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3002.9s)]
*  to sort of defend the idea of smoking weed, legalizing weed. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3006.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3010.98s)]
*  He was horrified by that. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3011.82s)]
*  It's the rare occasion where he just, without permission, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3013.58s)]
*  went out and wrote an angry essay, you know, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3018.06s)]
*  explicitly saying, [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3022.14s)]
*  I wish to categorically disassociate myself [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3023.46s)]
*  from this brand that she's selling [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3028.54s)]
*  of her Jamaican heritage being the reason [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3031.3799999999997s)]
*  why she supports legalized marijuana. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3034.1s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, if you actually are Jamaican, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3037.2999999999997s)]
*  the idea that everyone in Jamaica's, you know, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3039.4199999999996s)]
*  Peter Tosh is offensive. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3042.3399999999997s)]
*  It's offensive, right. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3044.4199999999996s)]
*  He was very angry about that. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3045.3799999999997s)]
*  So she doesn't get along with him then, clearly. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3046.22s)]
*  No, no, and he- [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3048.22s)]
*  Is he around today? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3050.42s)]
*  He was forced to take that. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3051.2200000000003s)]
*  Actually, he lives in Washington, D.C. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3052.1800000000003s)]
*  What? [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3054.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3054.86s)]
*  Harris's father lives in Washington, D.C., [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3055.7400000000002s)]
*  the father who denounced her. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3058.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3059.38s)]
*  What does he do? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3060.5s)]
*  What's the, tell me that story. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3061.34s)]
*  Why haven't I heard that? [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3062.58s)]
*  Yeah, we had some reporters from the Daily Mail, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3063.46s)]
*  which is where I work, and they sort of tracked him down, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3066.5s)]
*  and he does actually live in a house [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3069.98s)]
*  not too far away from Kamala Harris, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3071.7000000000003s)]
*  and it does not look like they spend a lot of time together, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3073.78s)]
*  if at all. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3077.1800000000003s)]
*  I think the last time he posted photos [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3078.2599999999998s)]
*  of an adult Kamala Harris and him together [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3080.2599999999998s)]
*  were from many years ago, before she came to Washington. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3082.3799999999997s)]
*  And he does a lot of work with economics [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3086.4599999999996s)]
*  and Jamaica and the World Bank. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3088.7s)]
*  But he's also semi-retired at this point. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3091.14s)]
*  So yeah, he's just kind of this figure that exists in D.C., [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3092.9399999999996s)]
*  but has no close connection with his daughter. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3096.58s)]
*  Has he ever talked about her [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3098.98s)]
*  other than to write an op-ed attacking her? [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3100.18s)]
*  He wrote in a brief piece about his Jamaican heritage [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3102.3399999999997s)]
*  and how Kamala Harris was connected to that. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3106.18s)]
*  He wrote that for a Jamaican newspaper, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3109.66s)]
*  where he talks about his life and having Kamala [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3111.98s)]
*  at a young age, and then becoming distant, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3116.4199999999996s)]
*  and then eventually estranged entirely from her. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3119.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very sad story. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3124.8599999999997s)]
*  He talks, he writes in his book, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3126.1s)]
*  his book about Marxist economics, [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3128.3799999999997s)]
*  he talks about, this book is dedicated to my daughters, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3131.74s)]
*  Kamala and Maya, from whatever relationship we have. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3134.66s)]
*  It's a little bit of a sad story, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3139.1s)]
*  because it seems like he was kind of pushed out [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3140.66s)]
*  of the family's life entirely after quite some time. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3142.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3147.94s)]
*  I mean, he wasn't at any of her victory parties [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3149.74s)]
*  for her political races. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3151.7s)]
*  He did not attend her inauguration. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3153.58s)]
*  Kamala never personally invited him to an inauguration. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3156.02s)]
*  I think the Times did a story a couple of weeks ago [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3159.74s)]
*  that said somehow he got an invitation [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3161.42s)]
*  through an intermediary, [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3163.42s)]
*  but he was never asked personally to come by his daughter. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3165.14s)]
*  Ouch. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3167.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3168.94s)]
*  Yeah, women who are mad at their dads, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3169.78s)]
*  tend to, not all, but a lot of them end up [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3173.78s)]
*  at wearing pink hats at women's marches. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3177.66s)]
*  And in general, if you're a father [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3179.7400000000002s)]
*  and your daughter grows up to be a man hater, [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3181.3s)]
*  it's probably kind of your fault. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3184.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3186.26s)]
*  Fair. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3187.1s)]
*  You sort of take on that responsibility. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3188.02s)]
*  You know. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3189.9s)]
*  Well, yeah, kind of, yeah. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3190.7400000000002s)]
*  You know that it's your fault, right? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3192.34s)]
*  If you don't have a relationship with your daughter, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3194.38s)]
*  then that's kind of your fault. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3196.46s)]
*  Yeah, if she's running around promoting abortion, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3197.3s)]
*  she'd occasion some soul searching on your part, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3200.94s)]
*  I would say. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3203.34s)]
*  But as a father of daughters, I can say that. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3204.1800000000003s)]
*  But so, anyway, so she comes to DC, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3207.26s)]
*  speaking of relationships, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3210.1400000000003s)]
*  how, and she's chosen by Joe Biden, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3211.5s)]
*  who has promised America to give us what we really want, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3213.7000000000003s)]
*  which is a female black vice president. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3216.98s)]
*  Well, they totally rejected it during the campaign, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3219.74s)]
*  when her failed presidential campaign, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3222.5s)]
*  when she thought she was launching this historic [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3225.22s)]
*  future forward looking campaign in 2019, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3228.98s)]
*  in January of 2019, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3232.2999999999997s)]
*  when she announces her run for president, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3233.8599999999997s)]
*  it doesn't go well. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3237.3399999999997s)]
*  And it goes really badly, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3238.5s)]
*  and I'm sorry to allide right over that. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3240.8599999999997s)]
*  So she announces, how long does she run for president? [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3242.9399999999996s)]
*  She's one of the first out of the gate. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3246.18s)]
*  She has all the support from many of the donors, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3248.02s)]
*  many of the major media elites. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3250.86s)]
*  She has this moment with people like Rachel Maddow, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3253.18s)]
*  who says, I do think that you are one of our strongest [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3256.1s)]
*  candidates, and I do think that you're gonna make it [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3258.74s)]
*  to the final finishing line. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3260.86s)]
*  It's really an impressive effort by the elite [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3262.66s)]
*  in the entire party. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3265.58s)]
*  They want to see Kamala Harris succeed, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3267.14s)]
*  and they're very bullish about her chances [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3269.3s)]
*  when she gets into the race. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3271.62s)]
*  It's such a funny race. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3272.58s)]
*  So the candidate that Democrats really want [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3274.38s)]
*  is the socialist, but he criticizes the banks, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3278.58s)]
*  so he cannot be allowed to be the nominee, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3281.02s)]
*  because you can't criticize banks. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3283.7400000000002s)]
*  That's immoral, criticizing banking. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3286.26s)]
*  And we're a little squeamish about universal healthcare. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3288.02s)]
*  But Kamala Harris- [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3292.1800000000003s)]
*  We don't actually wanna give Democratic voters [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3293.58s)]
*  anything they really want. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3295.2200000000003s)]
*  Right, so when she runs as this, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3296.7400000000002s)]
*  she moves herself so far to the left [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3300.54s)]
*  right before she runs for president. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3302.82s)]
*  She's become this radical leftist candidate, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3305.1400000000003s)]
*  even more radical than Bernie Sanders himself. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3307.1800000000003s)]
*  She endorses Medicare for All, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3310.1400000000003s)]
*  but when she's up on the debate stage, [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3311.98s)]
*  and they're like, but if you have Medicare for All, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3313.5800000000004s)]
*  and this means getting rid of private healthcare, [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3315.98s)]
*  and she's like, that's right, I agree. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3317.5800000000004s)]
*  And then when she gets enormous pushback media coverage, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3320.7000000000003s)]
*  the health insurance industry, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3325.7000000000003s)]
*  then she walks it back and says, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3328.38s)]
*  well, actually, I don't mean that. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3330.42s)]
*  I'm sure private insurance will still be around, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3332.5s)]
*  and I want it to be around, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3334.78s)]
*  even though there is socialized healthcare. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3335.82s)]
*  Well, that's not really how it works, [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3337.5s)]
*  but if you can pivot quickly to say that, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3339.38s)]
*  and then she makes the same mistake again. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3343.62s)]
*  And this is when you obviously have a core Democratic party [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3345.78s)]
*  that wants to see you as this leftist champion, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3350.46s)]
*  like Bernie Sanders is. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3352.9s)]
*  Kamala Harris really wants to be that figure, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3355.26s)]
*  and is doing her most desperate attempt [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3357.86s)]
*  to win sort of the Bernie Sanders mantle. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3361.26s)]
*  But the Bernie Sanders supporters are very angry with her [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3364.1000000000004s)]
*  for even pretending to be a socialist, [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3366.2200000000003s)]
*  Democratic socialist, right? [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3368.3s)]
*  Because she's not. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3370.7000000000003s)]
*  And so I think that there was a very- [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3372.3s)]
*  Well, she's a tool of the banks. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3373.9s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3376.0600000000004s)]
*  And the neocons and every other sort of evil institution [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3376.9s)]
*  in Democratic party land. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3380.0600000000004s)]
*  Well, she's willing to do the bidding of anybody [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3382.1000000000004s)]
*  who can get her in power. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3384.9s)]
*  She was never known in California as someone who is, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3386.94s)]
*  she talks about this, we keep going back, I'm sorry, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3390.02s)]
*  but she talks how much about how she fought the big banks [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3392.7s)]
*  to win this massive mortgage settlement [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3396.66s)]
*  after the disastrous 2008 crash. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3398.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3403.02s)]
*  But yeah, she didn't lead the charge. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3404.34s)]
*  It was led by Eric Schneiderman from New York, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3406.18s)]
*  who sort of rallied any progressive attorney general [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3408.66s)]
*  of a state, many who have gone on [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3412.58s)]
*  to have successful political careers, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3415.5s)]
*  and be like, this is our moment. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3417.3s)]
*  If we fight the big banks and earn a bigger settlement, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3419.06s)]
*  then we are automatically seen as champions. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3422.1s)]
*  And so she fought the big banks and got a bigger settlement, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3424.7s)]
*  but she still settled and- [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3428.02s)]
*  Well, she's a tool of the rich. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3429.9s)]
*  I mean, has been always the banking industry, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3431.46s)]
*  the abortion industry, the war industry. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3435.42s)]
*  She's a little foot soldier for industry. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3438.06s)]
*  I mean, that's always has been, right? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3441.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3442.82s)]
*  And activists have all been very frustrated [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3443.86s)]
*  with her unwillingness to take risks [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3446.5s)]
*  until she's running for president, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3449.02s)]
*  and then she's suddenly for everything. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3450.06s)]
*  She's for reducing red meat consumption. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3453.18s)]
*  She's for banning plastic straws. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3455.7400000000002s)]
*  She's for decriminalizing prostitution, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3458.54s)]
*  despite her mixed record on that. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3462.42s)]
*  She's for legalizing marijuana. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3463.7s)]
*  She just totally pivots and becomes this figure [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3466.78s)]
*  who supports every single radical agenda item [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3470.1s)]
*  during the Democratic primary. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3472.58s)]
*  And yet, somehow- [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3474.98s)]
*  Well, that makes sense as a feminist, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3476.54s)]
*  which is if obviously for women, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3478.38s)]
*  you want to encourage them to sell their bodies like slaves. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3480.06s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3482.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3483.98s)]
*  And apparently this is, you go on, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3484.82s)]
*  black needed to sell this as something that you want. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3488.1400000000003s)]
*  Something about freedom. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3492.02s)]
*  We need- [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3493.42s)]
*  What you need is decriminalization of prostitution [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3494.26s)]
*  and abortion to make yourself- [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3496.7000000000003s)]
*  Sell more weed, kill your children. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3498.6600000000003s)]
*  And smoke more weed. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3500.38s)]
*  And that's about freedom. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3502.42s)]
*  That's about success. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3503.42s)]
*  That's the opportunity economy that we want to sell. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3504.58s)]
*  That's the agenda of the goddess. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3509.3s)]
*  So her presidential campaign, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3512.5s)]
*  despite vigorous endorsement from white ladies [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3515.94s)]
*  like Rachel Maddow crashes and burns, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3519.7400000000002s)]
*  like the dogs won't eat the dog food, correct? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3522.1800000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3524.26s)]
*  How bad was it? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3525.1000000000004s)]
*  She goes to Iowa. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3525.94s)]
*  Once she hits Iowa, so her whole life, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3526.94s)]
*  she's lived in a one party state, California. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3529.6200000000003s)]
*  And the idea there is to get the backing of the elites, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3533.42s)]
*  donors, and then raise enough money [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3535.86s)]
*  to just plaster the air with advertising. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3538.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3541.46s)]
*  Then you win. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3542.3s)]
*  And as long as you have the blessing of the elites, [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3543.1400000000003s)]
*  then you can pretty much win in California. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3545.34s)]
*  You don't have to necessarily go on the ground [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3547.54s)]
*  and convince voters. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3549.58s)]
*  You just need those three things. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3551.6200000000003s)]
*  And so she goes into this primary in Iowa [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3553.7000000000003s)]
*  with sort of the same focus, right? [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3556.6600000000003s)]
*  Win the blessing of the elites, raise a bunch of money, [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3560.1400000000003s)]
*  run all the advertisements. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3563.7400000000002s)]
*  And then when she hits the ground in Iowa, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3565.58s)]
*  she suddenly finds that Democrats are not. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3567.66s)]
*  They're willing to listen, but when they listen to her, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3570.54s)]
*  they're not satisfied with what they're hearing. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3572.98s)]
*  They see her on the debate stages, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3574.94s)]
*  making the case for all of these progressive policies. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3576.94s)]
*  But then when she's asked to defend them, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3580.14s)]
*  she's either walking back or changing her mind [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3581.58s)]
*  on these issues. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3583.98s)]
*  On top of it all, in the beginning, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3585.34s)]
*  very beginning of her campaign is when the Jussie, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3587.1s)]
*  the Jussie Smollett stuff breaks. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3589.7s)]
*  And that's when she sort of rushes to his defense [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3592.7799999999997s)]
*  and is the first candidate sort of leading the march [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3596.3s)]
*  for justice for Jussie. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3598.02s)]
*  So she sends out a tweet. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3600.94s)]
*  It's like, wait, hold on, stop, stop, stop. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3602.26s)]
*  Here you are making fun of her. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3604.82s)]
*  She's totally fake. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3606.62s)]
*  But in one sense, she is a legitimate pioneer. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3607.66s)]
*  She was the first across the, not the Edmund Pettus Bridge, [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3609.9s)]
*  but the Jussie Smollett Bridge. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3614.58s)]
*  Like she was there facing off the guard dogs [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3616.18s)]
*  and fire hoses on behalf of Jussie Smollett. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3619.2200000000003s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3621.46s)]
*  She led the entire Democratic primary field [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3622.46s)]
*  to defend Jussie Smollett. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3627.58s)]
*  And then she still hasn't apologized for that, by the way. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3629.82s)]
*  She still hasn't taken down the tweet. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3634.02s)]
*  So she is in some sense a civil rights hero [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3634.86s)]
*  if you define civil rights as like fake hate crimes. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3637.1s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3639.46s)]
*  So. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3641.1s)]
*  And she's never apologized for that? [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3642.02s)]
*  No, she's never apologized for it. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3643.34s)]
*  She expressed regret that it happened, [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3645.06s)]
*  but she never apologized for it. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3647.58s)]
*  Was it passive construction? [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3649.7400000000002s)]
*  That it happened? [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3652.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3653.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3654.3s)]
*  Spontaneous combustion that just happened. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3655.1400000000003s)]
*  This is not good for people who have real hate crimes. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3657.5800000000004s)]
*  So, but she still has the tweet defending him [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3660.34s)]
*  as one of the smartest. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3663.3s)]
*  That's still up. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3664.6200000000003s)]
*  That's still up. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3665.78s)]
*  Just like her, you know, the famous Minnesota bailout [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3666.6200000000003s)]
*  of the protesters in Minneapolis. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3670.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3672.7000000000003s)]
*  That's still live too. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3673.54s)]
*  So she's not, she's not one to apologize very much. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3674.6200000000003s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3676.86s)]
*  It happens with a lot of politicians. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3678.02s)]
*  Certainly Joe Biden doesn't like to apologize for anything. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3679.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's so telling. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3682.42s)]
*  Whereas, you know, if you want to be strong, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3684.2200000000003s)]
*  apology is the only way. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3686.02s)]
*  Right. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3687.78s)]
*  And people saw her as like the anti-Biden. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3688.6200000000003s)]
*  So when she first goes out on the debate stage [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3690.5s)]
*  and basically calls him a racist, [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3693.82s)]
*  when they ask him about the accusations of women [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3696.6200000000003s)]
*  of unwanted touching and groping, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3699.3s)]
*  she says, I believe all women [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3701.2200000000003s)]
*  and they have the right to say that. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3703.1800000000003s)]
*  So she's one of the first ones to sort of tackle Biden [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3705.06s)]
*  as this out of touch dinosaur [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3707.98s)]
*  who no longer belongs on the national stage. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3710.62s)]
*  She said as much during the debate, you know, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3712.86s)]
*  trying to be nice. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3715.18s)]
*  I'm not calling you a racist, but let me call you a racist. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3716.02s)]
*  That's essentially what she said. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3718.82s)]
*  Because he wasn't enthusiastic enough about busing. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3720.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3724.34s)]
*  She pulled that from Biden's past, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3725.18s)]
*  but at the same time he's out there talking about [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3727.78s)]
*  the good old days when he worked with segregationists [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3729.78s)]
*  and everybody got along. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3731.78s)]
*  And certainly the modern left was like, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3733.82s)]
*  well, you can't do that. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3735.26s)]
*  I don't want that. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3736.7s)]
*  I don't want Joe Biden. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3738.1s)]
*  Bussing was a disaster. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3738.94s)]
*  It didn't help anybody. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3740.66s)]
*  It crushed white kids, it crushed black kids, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3742.06s)]
*  it destroyed public schools in the United States. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3744.42s)]
*  I'd love to hear someone explain why busing was a good idea. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3746.62s)]
*  Right. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3749.8999999999996s)]
*  In what sense was it a good idea? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3750.74s)]
*  Like how, where did that work exactly? [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3751.58s)]
*  And give me the numbers to show that it worked. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3753.94s)]
*  It didn't work. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3755.54s)]
*  It was horrible. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3756.8999999999996s)]
*  And the people who promoted it [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3757.94s)]
*  sent their own children to private school. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3759.06s)]
*  So like, I don't know. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3761.3799999999997s)]
*  The fact that she got up there on stage [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3763.3399999999997s)]
*  and yelled at Biden, who's a pig? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3765.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not defending Biden, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3767.54s)]
*  but like the one place he's been right in his career [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3768.54s)]
*  was to oppose busing. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3771.02s)]
*  Bussing was immoral as hell. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3771.94s)]
*  And nobody called her on it. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3774.4199999999996s)]
*  It was weird. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3775.8599999999997s)]
*  What was weird is that she was projecting herself [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3777.22s)]
*  as somehow this victim of segregation and suffrage [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3779.4199999999996s)]
*  growing up in Berkeley, California. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3783.66s)]
*  Growing up in Montreal. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3785.54s)]
*  I mean, that's where she went to high school. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3786.4199999999996s)]
*  That's where she went to high school. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3787.74s)]
*  Was there a lot of segregation in Montreal? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3789.4199999999996s)]
*  That famous moment, that little girl was me. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3790.2599999999998s)]
*  Talking about riding the bus [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3793.38s)]
*  from one wealthy California enclave to another. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3794.78s)]
*  And trying to embrace this idea [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3799.02s)]
*  that she was somehow this great civil rights figure. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3801.2200000000003s)]
*  It was rather offensive to a lot of black people [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3804.1400000000003s)]
*  who were just like, no. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3805.9s)]
*  Well, it's just insane. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3806.7400000000002s)]
*  What about white people? [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3807.58s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is nuts. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3808.42s)]
*  The idea that, whatever, without even getting into busing. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3810.3s)]
*  But I would just love to hear someone defend busing [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3813.82s)]
*  on its own terms. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3815.78s)]
*  Like where was busing a success? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3817.26s)]
*  Who benefited from it exactly? [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3818.7000000000003s)]
*  Right, and when they asked her, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3820.54s)]
*  well, what's your position on busing? [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3821.82s)]
*  She found herself unable to explain. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3823.94s)]
*  And they really like, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3826.46s)]
*  well, why are we talking about busing anyway? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3827.7000000000003s)]
*  Right? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3829.82s)]
*  It was an attempt to just find any cudgel at all [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3830.6600000000003s)]
*  to hit Joe Biden. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3833.7400000000002s)]
*  No, it's totally right. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3834.5800000000004s)]
*  It made a big splash. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3835.42s)]
*  Did she really say that? [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3836.26s)]
*  Why are we talking about it in the first place? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3837.1000000000004s)]
*  No, that's what I'm saying. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3838.7000000000003s)]
*  But when they asked her for her position on busing, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3839.5400000000004s)]
*  she's like, well, I don't know. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3842.38s)]
*  She didn't have a good answer [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3844.3s)]
*  of whether or not she would support federal busing. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3845.5s)]
*  Gosh, this is ridiculous. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3849.94s)]
*  You don't have to- [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3851.7400000000002s)]
*  It was such an obvious political attack. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3852.58s)]
*  Well, but you don't even need to try that hard to expose her. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3854.26s)]
*  She exposes herself. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3858.66s)]
*  It's all so fake. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3859.82s)]
*  A lot of bad things going on in the world [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3861.3s)]
*  that honestly not many of us can have an effect on. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3862.94s)]
*  Rising crime, failing schools, a tanking economy. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3866.98s)]
*  What can you do about that? [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3870.98s)]
*  Well, not a lot, but you can get your own house in order. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3872.14s)]
*  And above all, you can spend money with merchants, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3876.14s)]
*  with companies that support your values [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3879.66s)]
*  that are making us a better country and not a worse country. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3881.7000000000003s)]
*  But how do you find those companies? [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3884.62s)]
*  Well, that's where Public Square comes in. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3886.78s)]
*  Public Square actively curates the best products [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3889.06s)]
*  from America's small businesses to help families [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3891.54s)]
*  lead happier, healthier, more productive and connected lives. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3893.78s)]
*  That means fewer errands to big box stores. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3897.62s)]
*  Let's searching to find wholesome alternatives [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3900.3s)]
*  to the garbage being offered in our culture [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3902.7000000000003s)]
*  and more quality time spent with people you love most. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3904.98s)]
*  If you want to fix your country, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3908.18s)]
*  you've got to strengthen yourself and your home [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3909.5s)]
*  and you need to spend your dollars [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3911.46s)]
*  where they do good and not bad. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3912.78s)]
*  Rebuilding America takes place one small change at a time [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3915.34s)]
*  with wise spending, supporting people who support your family, [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3919.86s)]
*  not funding people who hate you. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3923.86s)]
*  If you want to do that, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3926.26s)]
*  publicsquare.com is the answer, publicsquare.com. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3927.38s)]
*  Was she ever popular in California? [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3931.1s)]
*  Did you ever find evidence that she was, [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3932.9s)]
*  like had majority support in the state? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3935.06s)]
*  Just widely accepted. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3935.9s)]
*  She won her elections pretty handily, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3937.2200000000003s)]
*  except for the one race she had problems with [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3939.1400000000003s)]
*  was running through the district, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3941.78s)]
*  the attorney general's race. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3944.7000000000003s)]
*  There was a formidable Republican still in the state, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3946.02s)]
*  Steve Cooley, who posed a pretty big threat. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3948.34s)]
*  But did she, I've often heard people say, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3951.7400000000002s)]
*  but I've never checked it myself, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3954.7000000000003s)]
*  that when she ran for president, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3956.58s)]
*  she did not have anywhere near majority support [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3958.1s)]
*  in her own state. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3961.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that correct? [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3962.98s)]
*  That was the big problem, [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3963.94s)]
*  is that she thought she could use California [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3965.38s)]
*  as a springboard. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3969.18s)]
*  Like obviously they will rally around me in California [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3970.26s)]
*  and push me forward as the next great leader [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3972.82s)]
*  of the Democratic party. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3975.02s)]
*  But people in California did not. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3976.14s)]
*  She was so low in the polls in California, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3978.7s)]
*  she had to quit before she got to the California primary [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3980.5s)]
*  because they obviously favored Bernie. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3983.14s)]
*  Yeah, well Bernie's not allowed [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3985.46s)]
*  because the donors didn't like Bernie. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3987.18s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3988.62s)]
*  There was that. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3989.5s)]
*  Well, and then the biggest, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3991.58s)]
*  I think the moment that was critical for her campaign, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3993.06s)]
*  she was still kind of limping along [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3996.1s)]
*  even after the Biden attack. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=3998.18s)]
*  Some people liked it, some people didn't. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4000.02s)]
*  And most, more importantly, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4001.66s)]
*  the people who were really in charge of the party [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4004.18s)]
*  and who was going to win were not happy with it. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4006.86s)]
*  And I think that's kind of why she pulled back. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4009.58s)]
*  Like with Biden's record, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4012.5s)]
*  and if you're a Democrat, a young rising Democrat, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4014.26s)]
*  and if you really want to take out Joe Biden, [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4017.34s)]
*  if you go at him hard for about four or five months [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4019.86s)]
*  on his record, you can pretty much turn the entire, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4022.26s)]
*  I think you could have turned the entire party against him. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4026.02s)]
*  But because he was sort of seen as maybe the only one [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4029.94s)]
*  who could defeat Donald Trump, [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4033.46s)]
*  I think that there was a lot of force [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4034.6600000000003s)]
*  from the establishment Democratic party. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4037.2200000000003s)]
*  This is like, look, just leave him alone. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4038.98s)]
*  He might be what we need. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4042.1400000000003s)]
*  It's just crazy that the anti-white party [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4043.7400000000002s)]
*  in the end nominated an old straight white guy. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4046.54s)]
*  Right. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4050.18s)]
*  Blowing past the- [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4051.02s)]
*  Out of the position of fear, right? [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4051.86s)]
*  The fake black lady, the gay guy, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4052.86s)]
*  who may not even really be gay, I don't really know, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4055.5s)]
*  but a guy who claims he's gay anyway. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4057.82s)]
*  And they pick a 76 year old straight white guy, really? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4060.62s)]
*  With all this baggage and history of Democrats past, right? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4067.46s)]
*  It's like- [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4070.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's just interesting. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4071.62s)]
*  So- [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4073.02s)]
*  Oh, the moment that effectively ends her campaign, [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4073.86s)]
*  as I was saying, is the moment that Tulsi Gabbard [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4076.82s)]
*  had the courage to get on stage [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4079.42s)]
*  and call her out as a fake progressive. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4080.9s)]
*  Yeah, as a warmonger. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4082.86s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4083.86s)]
*  And I think that really deep sixed her campaign [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4084.7s)]
*  and crushed her. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4088.18s)]
*  She was never able to recover from that. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4089.34s)]
*  There was several attempts at reboots. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4091.34s)]
*  At one point standing for censorship [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4094.7s)]
*  of President Trump on Twitter, [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4096.3s)]
*  that somehow she was gonna leverage [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4098.02s)]
*  her entire political reboot on this idea [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4099.82s)]
*  of censoring President Donald Trump, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4102.38s)]
*  or even progressives like Elizabeth Warren. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4104.38s)]
*  We're like, what are you doing? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4106.42s)]
*  How is that even legal? [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4107.74s)]
*  This doesn't even make any sense. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4108.9400000000005s)]
*  Weren't she the attorney general? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4110.1s)]
*  You're supposed to be a- [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4111.5s)]
*  I think you're supposed to support free speech [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4113.34s)]
*  as part of the constitution. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4115.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4116.900000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, she delivered a speech [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4118.1s)]
*  to the NAACP that said, [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4120.1s)]
*  I will increase the number of attorneys [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4122.26s)]
*  at the Department of Justice [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4126.3s)]
*  to go after hate speech misinformation on social media. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4127.66s)]
*  And these social media companies [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4132.06s)]
*  better be very afraid for what I want to do. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4133.620000000001s)]
*  Yeah, don't give up your guns. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4136.9800000000005s)]
*  Like we need to hold them responsible [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4137.820000000001s)]
*  for everything that's posted on there. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4139.42s)]
*  Yeah, for criticizing us. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4141.26s)]
*  It shouldn't be allowed. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4142.5s)]
*  How do people like that, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4144.26s)]
*  who weren't even meaningfully attached [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4145.900000000001s)]
*  to this country in any way or understand what it is, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4147.900000000001s)]
*  how do they get positions of power? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4150.740000000001s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4152.700000000001s)]
*  Like how could someone like Kamala Harris, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4153.54s)]
*  who obviously doesn't like the United States, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4155.38s)]
*  but doesn't even really understand it, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4158.06s)]
*  she gets to administer our laws, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4160.62s)]
*  there's something wrong with our system, don't you think? [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4162.7s)]
*  Right, I think it's very much focused on [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4165.34s)]
*  how can we find a willing participant [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4167.54s)]
*  to do everything we say [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4169.46s)]
*  and be willing to be flexible [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4171.54s)]
*  on a number of different issues. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4173.74s)]
*  Someone who doesn't have any core values [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4174.78s)]
*  is easier to manipulate. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4177.3s)]
*  And I think that they saw her as somebody, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4180.5s)]
*  which is part of the reason why [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4182.58s)]
*  they chose her as vice president. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4184.74s)]
*  This is someone who obviously has the support [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4186.18s)]
*  of the biggest donors, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4189.62s)]
*  who also has been out in the streets [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4190.82s)]
*  during the George Floyd protests, [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4193.42s)]
*  backing the idea of these protests. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4197.0599999999995s)]
*  And what better person to be President Biden's running mate [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4199.82s)]
*  than the person who accused him of being a racist. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4204.0199999999995s)]
*  Than the lady from the HR department, [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4207.26s)]
*  which is what she really is. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4209.18s)]
*  Bring her into, and that's sort of what she, [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4210.42s)]
*  that was sort of how she leveraged her way [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4213.1s)]
*  into the front of the pack, right? [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4215.62s)]
*  It was during the entire Black Lives Matter, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4217.58s)]
*  George Floyd protests of 2020 [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4220.3s)]
*  that tore up the entire country. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4222.46s)]
*  And I think that many in the Democratic party [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4225.18s)]
*  thought that she was necessary to tack on to Biden, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4227.74s)]
*  who clearly had his problems during the debates [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4231.38s)]
*  on his, on black issues, you know, [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4234.34s)]
*  suggesting to black families [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4235.7s)]
*  that if they didn't play the record player at night, [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4238.1s)]
*  they were raising their children wrong [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4239.86s)]
*  and telling all these bizarre stories of, you know, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4242.06s)]
*  relationships with black people [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4246.46s)]
*  and were just totally out of touch. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4248.02s)]
*  So I do think they felt that they needed [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4250.34s)]
*  to put the Obama coalition back together [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4252.46s)]
*  if he was gonna have a chance of winning. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4255.1s)]
*  And in order to do that, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4256.9s)]
*  you need a person of color on the ticket. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4257.74s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's like the rich white liberal way [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4259.66s)]
*  of understanding black people. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4263.86s)]
*  And I bet you money that Biden in the end [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4265.46s)]
*  will wind up doing better with black voters [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4270.1s)]
*  than Kamala Harris. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4271.82s)]
*  I bet you, I bet you money. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4272.94s)]
*  I mean, I'm off it. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4274.62s)]
*  It clearly was in South Carolina, right? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4275.58s)]
*  When he won all the black vote in South Carolina. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4277.54s)]
*  Well, yeah, cause Jim Clyburn. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4280.78s)]
*  He became the nominee after South Carolina [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4283.38s)]
*  and they found out that, you know, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4287.26s)]
*  black people actually like him and will vote for him. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4289.22s)]
*  Then it was like time to clear the field. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4291.06s)]
*  And I get that. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4293.22s)]
*  And I bet you. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4294.18s)]
*  He was the vice president for the first black president. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4295.02s)]
*  And well, yeah, but he's just also, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4297.74s)]
*  he's a little bit slightly more authentic than her. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4300.38s)]
*  Like she's so obviously fake. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4303.74s)]
*  But what do I know? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4306.62s)]
*  I do know that she's Rachel Maddow's [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4309.5s)]
*  version of a black candidate. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4312.98s)]
*  But anyway, so, okay. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4316.62s)]
*  So she gets chosen by Biden. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4318.34s)]
*  Was there any jog my memory real contest? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4320.78s)]
*  Were there other people in her consideration? [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4324.58s)]
*  Right, cause he famously came out [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4327.0199999999995s)]
*  when he's trying to seal the deal with Bernie. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4329.26s)]
*  He comes out during a debate in the spring saying, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4331.0599999999995s)]
*  I will choose a woman vice president. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4334.38s)]
*  And got a little splashed. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4335.9s)]
*  Nobody remembers the substance of the debate. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4337.38s)]
*  Just that headline, right? [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4339.54s)]
*  And then it became, you know, as he's exploring the idea, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4341.34s)]
*  like there's a number of women he really liked, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4344.5s)]
*  but certainly on the top of the list were some of these [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4347.06s)]
*  sort of these figures like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4350.26s)]
*  who he felt was kind of this fun rising power in Michigan [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4356.46s)]
*  who was kind of populous when she ran for office [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4361.62s)]
*  and kind of had this idea of fixing the damn roads. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4363.9800000000005s)]
*  You know, that's just music to the ears of this, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4366.9s)]
*  this future president that just wants to fix infrastructure. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4369.06s)]
*  That's one of his biggest issues. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4372.86s)]
*  So he was certainly attracted by her. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4374.38s)]
*  Amy Klobuchar was also someone else [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4376.22s)]
*  that he was interested in bringing on board. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4378.06s)]
*  Someone who he thought would be good. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4379.94s)]
*  But it became very clear that, [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4382.46s)]
*  and in certainly his campaign advisors as well, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4384.7s)]
*  believe that no, it's not just enough to have a woman [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4388.66s)]
*  on the ticket, we need a woman of color on the ticket. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4391.379999999999s)]
*  Because if you look back at Hillary Clinton, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4393.099999999999s)]
*  she lost a lot of the black vote. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4394.98s)]
*  Because she chose- [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4397.139999999999s)]
*  You're talking about color by the way. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4397.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4399.74s)]
*  It's dependent on the people that vote for Democrats. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4400.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4405.219999999999s)]
*  A big part of their. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4406.0599999999995s)]
*  So I feel like he really wanted to pick a Gretchen Whitmer [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4407.86s)]
*  or an Amy Klobuchar. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4412.299999999999s)]
*  And certainly the Biden family was not happy [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4414.74s)]
*  with the idea of Kamala Harris as vice president. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4417.7s)]
*  She's the one that actually came out [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4420.34s)]
*  and attacked him for being a racist. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4421.9400000000005s)]
*  So when it became clear, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4423.900000000001s)]
*  if you remember Hillary Clinton, she chose Tim Kaine, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4427.82s)]
*  who one of the most vanilla people in the Senate [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4430.9800000000005s)]
*  as her running mate. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4434.06s)]
*  And she also lost a lot of the black votes. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4434.900000000001s)]
*  So the smart people consultants in Washington [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4436.78s)]
*  are saying the time's the man that we choose. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4440.1s)]
*  A woman of color, a black woman. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4443.1s)]
*  They are the dumbest people I've ever met. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4444.5s)]
*  So Biden looks at these options [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4447.74s)]
*  and he has on his top of the list as he's heading into it, [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4452.219999999999s)]
*  it's Kamala Harris, Susan Rice, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4456.58s)]
*  who he has a good relationship with [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4459.099999999999s)]
*  from his time in the Obama administration. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4460.66s)]
*  And so those are sort of his top two picks. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4465.139999999999s)]
*  And the fact that Susan Rice is even being considered [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4469.94s)]
*  seriously shows that she was, [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4472.38s)]
*  that they do not want Kamala. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4475.18s)]
*  Susan Rice was Jill's favorite, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4478.22s)]
*  but ultimately between his conversations with his donors, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4480.18s)]
*  with his advisors and certainly with Obama himself, [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4484.42s)]
*  he was urged to sort of put the past behind him [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4487.42s)]
*  and choose Kamala Harris. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4489.820000000001s)]
*  So it's interesting, I know Susan Rice pretty well [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4491.18s)]
*  and I think she's a scary person [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4493.58s)]
*  who's motivated basically by hate, but she's capable. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4496.660000000001s)]
*  She's a real person. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4501.42s)]
*  Kamala Harris is not a real person, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4503.22s)]
*  is totally fraudulent, just DEI pick, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4504.34s)]
*  but Susan Rice is not. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4507.62s)]
*  And Susan Rice is a pretty serious person. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4509.18s)]
*  And like if you had- [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4512.34s)]
*  It might've been difficult to run a campaign [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4513.42s)]
*  with Susan Rice, right? [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4515.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4517.14s)]
*  I feel like she may have- [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4517.9800000000005s)]
*  I've always been kind of impressed by Susan Rice, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4518.820000000001s)]
*  even though I fear Susan Rice [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4520.42s)]
*  and I think, I don't think she's a particularly good person, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4521.900000000001s)]
*  but I definitely have some respect for Susan Rice. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4524.14s)]
*  She was my neighbor for years. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4529.5s)]
*  Oh really? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4531.9400000000005s)]
*  For any conservative, they would see Susan Rice [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4533.38s)]
*  as the face of Benghazi and why would you ever want- [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4537.139999999999s)]
*  Well, the whole Benghazi story was bullshit [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4540.3s)]
*  in the first place. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4542.259999999999s)]
*  And the amount of lying by conservative media [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4543.34s)]
*  about Benghazi enrages me. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4545.74s)]
*  The point of Benghazi was they were moving weapons [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4547.58s)]
*  from Gaddafi's weapons stockpiles to Syria [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4551.82s)]
*  to fight an undeclared war that only hurt the United States [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4555.3s)]
*  and a lot of those weapons [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4559.62s)]
*  were going to Islamic extremist groups. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4560.7s)]
*  And that was the actual story. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4563.0199999999995s)]
*  And that was suppressed because the neocons [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4564.66s)]
*  didn't wanna talk about that. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4566.94s)]
*  Wow. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4568.82s)]
*  And I just sat in rage for years watching this Benghazi. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4569.66s)]
*  I mean, the Benghazi story was real. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4572.66s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4574.139999999999s)]
*  People died. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4574.98s)]
*  The reason for- [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4575.9s)]
*  It was a true tragedy, but no one was allowed to ask, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4576.74s)]
*  well, like, what were all those CI officers [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4578.98s)]
*  doing in Benghazi in the first place? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4581.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there was, I think it was Rand Paul. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4582.3s)]
*  He was sort of the only one who- [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4584.46s)]
*  Did you ever hear anyone ask, like, what was that? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4586.099999999999s)]
*  Wait a second, okay. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4588.42s)]
*  Why? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4589.26s)]
*  Fascinating. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4590.740000000001s)]
*  Just as someone from DC, I'm like, wait a second, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4591.58s)]
*  why were there that many CIA personnel in this one town? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4593.700000000001s)]
*  And I remember asking that myself in television [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4598.06s)]
*  and having a producer say to me, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4600.58s)]
*  that's not really the story. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4602.38s)]
*  And I was like, well, actually I think it is the story. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4603.34s)]
*  It's part of the story anyway. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4605.9400000000005s)]
*  It's the context of the story. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4607.1s)]
*  Sorry, I've been mad about this for a decade. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4608.9800000000005s)]
*  No, I'm only saying that I'm not- [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4611.54s)]
*  Susan Rice, right. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4614.14s)]
*  I'm not endorsing anything that Susan Rice has ever done. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4615.38s)]
*  I think Susan Rice is one of the reasons [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4617.62s)]
*  that the country's so screwed up right now. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4620.18s)]
*  All I'm saying is, if your job is to run the government, [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4622.58s)]
*  you don't wanna pick someone who's like pathetic, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4626.5s)]
*  like Kamala Harris, who's not done a single thing [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4631.14s)]
*  in her entire life. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4633.98s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4635.14s)]
*  And is just clearly not a capable person. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4636.18s)]
*  Can't make a decision, doesn't have a clear- [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4637.94s)]
*  Doesn't have much experience, had never done anything. [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4641.38s)]
*  Like even Obama delivered a great speech [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4644.0199999999995s)]
*  that everybody thought was the, had healed the nation. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4646.06s)]
*  Obama's a talented guy. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4649.34s)]
*  He was a figure, right? [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4650.860000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris was never a figure. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4651.9400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4653.5s)]
*  And I mean, Susan Rice- [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4654.580000000001s)]
*  They really wanted her to be. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4656.3s)]
*  They started by calling her the- [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4657.740000000001s)]
*  It's just your classic rich white liberal view of the world. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4659.580000000001s)]
*  It's only, all that matters is your skin color. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4662.22s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4665.22s)]
*  It's not so different from the segregationist view [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4666.06s)]
*  of the world, which they also supported. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4669.3s)]
*  Their parents supported in the Democratic Party. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4671.580000000001s)]
*  It's just like, all that matters is what color you are. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4673.74s)]
*  Anyway, whatever, don't get me going. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4676.62s)]
*  But okay, so they pick her. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4677.98s)]
*  What's her relation? [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4680.82s)]
*  You say Jill Biden was actually for Susan Rice. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4681.74s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4685.82s)]
*  What is the relationship between Kamala and the Bidens [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4687.219999999999s)]
*  once she gets chosen? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4690.98s)]
*  So I really think that Joe Biden felt that he could, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4692.58s)]
*  that Kamala would be his buddy. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4695.34s)]
*  He really wanted a buddy vice president. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4697.139999999999s)]
*  And he really thought Kamala could rise to the occasion [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4698.9s)]
*  and learn how to be a good vice president [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4701.62s)]
*  because he had been a vice president. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4704.0599999999995s)]
*  He knew what it took. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4705.78s)]
*  For eight years. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4706.62s)]
*  For everything you can say about Joe Biden, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4707.46s)]
*  he was very deferential to the president [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4710.0599999999995s)]
*  and he was very loyal to him and worked very hard. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4713.5s)]
*  Like Obama's not sort of a warm, glowing figure [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4716.94s)]
*  that wants to be friends with everybody. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4721.9s)]
*  But Biden sort of wormed his way in [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4724.46s)]
*  to a buddy type relationship with Obama. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4727.14s)]
*  And they actually got along pretty well [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4730.3s)]
*  when they were in office, despite obvious frictions [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4732.42s)]
*  between the two camps, that always happens. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4735.62s)]
*  But I think that he thought that Kamala Harris [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4738.860000000001s)]
*  would sort of drop everything and become wholly united [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4741.14s)]
*  to his vision and his campaign. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4744.62s)]
*  But they found out very soon after they took office [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4747.1s)]
*  that no, Kamala Harris had no interest [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4749.9800000000005s)]
*  in being Joe Biden's buddy. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4752.02s)]
*  Had no interest in taking hard issues off his plate [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4753.9400000000005s)]
*  or defending him. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4757.42s)]
*  I think it was very clear from the moment [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4758.94s)]
*  she got into office, she was here for the next step [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4760.62s)]
*  in her career and she was going to do everything possible [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4762.74s)]
*  to sort of preserve her political future [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4766.379999999999s)]
*  and not wasted on this aging Joe Biden [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4769.179999999999s)]
*  who was clearly on his way out. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4772.5s)]
*  It sounds- [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4774.139999999999s)]
*  Nicely put, Charlie. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4774.98s)]
*  Wait, so you're saying that Joe Biden picked [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4776.259999999999s)]
*  a ruthless careerist loyal to no one but herself [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4778.299999999999s)]
*  and was shocked to discover that she was a ruthless careerist [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4781.179999999999s)]
*  loyal to no one but herself. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4783.74s)]
*  And someone who was not competent. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4785.099999999999s)]
*  Man, she's dumb. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4788.34s)]
*  Wow. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4792.26s)]
*  Do you think they were really surprised by that? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4793.1s)]
*  I think so. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4794.7s)]
*  I think Biden really thought that she would rise [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4795.54s)]
*  to the occasion and realize the nature of the job. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4798.900000000001s)]
*  Well, he was seen out of that, huh? [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4802.02s)]
*  Yeah, I guess so. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4803.46s)]
*  But yeah, it became very clear that she was not there [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4806.46s)]
*  to help him. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4809.34s)]
*  She was there to the next step in her career. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4810.46s)]
*  And she kind of has this, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4813.82s)]
*  kind of has this, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4815.74s)]
*  this kind of aspect goes back [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4818.62s)]
*  throughout her entire career, right? [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4820.42s)]
*  She rises with Willie Brown. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4821.78s)]
*  And then when Willie Brown leaves office, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4824.0599999999995s)]
*  she kicks him under the bus. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4825.9s)]
*  Basically saying, if he commits any crimes, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4828.179999999999s)]
*  I'm going to throw him in jail. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4830.259999999999s)]
*  And you sort of kicks him under the bus [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4832.94s)]
*  as someone that's no longer politically relevant. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4834.62s)]
*  Right? She said that? [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4836.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4837.62s)]
*  When she's running for district attorney, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4838.46s)]
*  that's all people wanted to talk about. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4839.9s)]
*  This is the woman who dated Willie Brown. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4843.06s)]
*  She's obviously corrupt. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4844.860000000001s)]
*  And she's like, no, Willie Brown, I'm done with him. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4845.9400000000005s)]
*  He has no influence on me, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4849.1s)]
*  even though he's behind the scenes raising money for her. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4850.740000000001s)]
*  She essentially throws Willie Brown under the bus. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4853.740000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's a good idea to date Kamala Harris. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4856.900000000001s)]
*  And that's the picture that's emerging. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4859.14s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4861.18s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4862.26s)]
*  Certainly not in her early career. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4863.5s)]
*  No. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4865.54s)]
*  And she didn't eventually- [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4866.38s)]
*  I just want people listening to this to remember, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4867.620000000001s)]
*  do not date Kamala Harris. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4868.9800000000005s)]
*  Unless you're Doug Emhoff, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4870.54s)]
*  and then perhaps you can get remarried [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4871.86s)]
*  to a 50-year-old woman [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4875.62s)]
*  and who has a career path into national politics. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4879.06s)]
*  He's pretty tough on the ladies though. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4883.7s)]
*  I mean, he runs a tight ship. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4885.18s)]
*  He'll smack you in the valet line if you get mouthy with him. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4886.58s)]
*  There's been some great reporting [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4889.78s)]
*  at the Daily Mail about that. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4890.94s)]
*  Sorry, I'm getting ahead of the story. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4892.98s)]
*  So Joe Biden [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4894.62s)]
*  thinks that Kamala Harris is gonna be his little friend. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4898.38s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4901.18s)]
*  His little black friend, actually. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4902.02s)]
*  His cool black friend. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4903.860000000001s)]
*  Or certainly a supportive force [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4904.7s)]
*  to sort of ease up all the tension he's getting [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4908.02s)]
*  from women and black people. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4910.34s)]
*  Maybe Kamala Harris will help. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4912.14s)]
*  Try to make the ladies settle down. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4913.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4915.18s)]
*  Because Obama did this to Biden, right? [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4919.46s)]
*  Anytime you had a thorny issue, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4921.54s)]
*  you'd be like, I'm gonna put Sheriff Joe in charge of this [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4922.74s)]
*  and he's gonna take care of it. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4924.9800000000005s)]
*  And Biden realized what Obama was doing, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4926.26s)]
*  but he just sort of grinned and be like, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4928.54s)]
*  yep, I'm the vice president. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4929.9800000000005s)]
*  This is what we do. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4931.3s)]
*  So right away, the first thing for Kamala Harris, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4933.54s)]
*  it's like, we need you to take a thorny issue off our plate. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4937.58s)]
*  We're going to put you in charge of immigration. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4940.62s)]
*  And we all saw how that went, right? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4943.9400000000005s)]
*  And she was very adamant about, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4946.34s)]
*  I'm not in charge of immigration. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4949.820000000001s)]
*  I'm not the immigration czar. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4951.58s)]
*  I'm only in charge of root causes in the Northern Triangle. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4953.1s)]
*  She was very adamant about that. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4958.02s)]
*  Even correcting Joe Biden behind the scenes [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4959.26s)]
*  when he's in Congress, he's like, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4962.34s)]
*  and Kamala is gonna take care of the immigration problem. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4963.660000000001s)]
*  And she would be like, actually, no, Mr. President, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4966.9400000000005s)]
*  I am only handling the root causes of immigration. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4969.9400000000005s)]
*  Maybe it's Mayorkas or somebody else [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4974.26s)]
*  that's actually gonna handle the immigration problem for you [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4977.46s)]
*  because that's not my job. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4979.620000000001s)]
*  But now we have this whole thing, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4981.1s)]
*  she was never the border czar. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4983.820000000001s)]
*  But she was in charge of the messaging on immigration [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4986.14s)]
*  when she made her trip to Guatemala [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4990.22s)]
*  and told migrants, do not come. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4994.38s)]
*  If you come, I believe you will be sent away. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=4997.700000000001s)]
*  Well, we all saw how effective that messaging was. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5000.860000000001s)]
*  So it's very clear that the administration [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5004.54s)]
*  really wanted her to take this issue off the plate [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5007.660000000001s)]
*  to be the messenger on immigration. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5010.06s)]
*  And she sort of wriggled out of that assignment. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5012.18s)]
*  Ultimately, did she succeed in any aspect of the root causes? [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5015.06s)]
*  I think they might have some metrics to say she did. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5019.42s)]
*  But did she fix Mexico? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5021.900000000001s)]
*  She certainly didn't fix any root causes as we know it. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5023.34s)]
*  It's also absurd. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5026.660000000001s)]
*  And root causes is always a dodge. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5028.54s)]
*  Not that there aren't root causes, there are. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5030.26s)]
*  But whenever you see a politician pivot from- [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5032.660000000001s)]
*  Well, let's get to the core. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5035.700000000001s)]
*  The problem to its root causes, [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5036.58s)]
*  you realize that politician is just punting. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5039.7s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5043.0199999999995s)]
*  So what was in the end, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5044.9s)]
*  Joe and Jill Biden's view of Kamala Harris? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5048.78s)]
*  Disappointment, I think. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5053.14s)]
*  I think they really hoped she would rise to the occasion [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5054.5s)]
*  when there's reporting done that Joe Biden said [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5056.74s)]
*  that she was work in progress just two months ago. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5060.3s)]
*  She still believes that she was making her way, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5065.06s)]
*  but probably hadn't risen and seized the imaginations [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5068.9800000000005s)]
*  of the American public as well as they had hoped [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5073.9800000000005s)]
*  as being the sort of transformational figure, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5076.660000000001s)]
*  historic figure, right? [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5078.42s)]
*  Like, how can you not just instantly become an American icon? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5080.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5084.9400000000005s)]
*  But with Kamala Harris, it was a very big struggle. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5085.780000000001s)]
*  American icon. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5088.3s)]
*  Certainly Obama was an American icon, right? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5091.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5094.22s)]
*  She's a member of the master race, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5095.88s)]
*  so we have to worship her. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5096.72s)]
*  But no, that's not how it really works. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5098.24s)]
*  In the end, if I can just restate the obvious, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5100.48s)]
*  Obama, who I think was evil and bad for America, [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5103.6s)]
*  but he was really talented. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5106.56s)]
*  And I don't think it was because he was black, [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5109.28s)]
*  he's just talented. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5111.12s)]
*  No, he was very talented and very, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5112.16s)]
*  but it was people like Joe Biden who's like, wow. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5116.0s)]
*  He was the one on the record, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5118.92s)]
*  praising him for being an articulate black guy. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5120.88s)]
*  Exactly, it shows how racist the rich white liberal is, [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5123.88s)]
*  because all they see in Obama is black. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5128.2s)]
*  And they're like, oh, we just get some black person in here [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5130.12s)]
*  so when we can call black, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5132.4400000000005s)]
*  that person will become an American icon. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5133.56s)]
*  And it's like, no, you kind of have to earn it, right? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5135.16s)]
*  And imagine if you're Kamala Harris, right? [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5138.28s)]
*  You're brought into the Democratic party [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5140.0s)]
*  as this transformational figure, as this icon. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5141.72s)]
*  They view you as the female Obama. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5145.52s)]
*  It's very insulting, right? [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5148.04s)]
*  Because they don't- [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5149.400000000001s)]
*  It's so insulting, it's insane. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5150.24s)]
*  And this happened with Tulsi Gabbard too, [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5152.4s)]
*  because if you remember, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5154.84s)]
*  and she's done a number of great interviews [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5156.12s)]
*  with Rogan with you, where she talks about [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5158.4s)]
*  how when she first got, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5161.16s)]
*  when she was first elected to Congress, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5162.52s)]
*  the Democratic party immediately brings her into [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5164.92s)]
*  the higher echelons of power, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5167.36s)]
*  not the important ones, right? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5168.92s)]
*  But the one- [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5170.72s)]
*  The vice chair of the DNC? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5171.56s)]
*  Yeah, bring her into these positions [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5172.56s)]
*  because she's seen as this obvious person [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5175.52s)]
*  that we need to center our agenda on [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5180.08s)]
*  to show how diverse and how open we are [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5181.76s)]
*  to new personalities and new people [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5185.5199999999995s)]
*  and how fresh and young and interesting we are. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5188.36s)]
*  And the minute she diverts from the, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5191.28s)]
*  she talked about this, [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5194.16s)]
*  how she was celebrated by all Democrats. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5195.0s)]
*  And the minute she diverts from the agenda [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5197.96s)]
*  to warn about war in Syria, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5200.48s)]
*  which is something she profoundly believes in, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5202.12s)]
*  war, she's bent to war, she does not like war. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5205.0s)]
*  But the minute she diverts from the agenda, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5208.44s)]
*  everyone's like, oh, I'm so sorry, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5211.2s)]
*  your political career is over [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5213.36s)]
*  and now we're going to ostracize- [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5214.96s)]
*  They never listened to what she said. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5216.32s)]
*  I mean, her views didn't change. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5218.12s)]
*  No. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5220.24s)]
*  She believed that when she got elected from Hawaii, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5221.08s)]
*  but all they saw was the way she looked. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5224.719999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5226.96s)]
*  Because they're racist and they judge people [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5227.799999999999s)]
*  on the basis of their race. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5229.879999999999s)]
*  That's the definition of racist. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5230.96s)]
*  And they saw her and they're like, [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5232.5199999999995s)]
*  oh, she's not white, therefore she's great. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5235.36s)]
*  And they never heard a word she uttered. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5237.88s)]
*  Even when she ran for president, they just ignored her. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5240.24s)]
*  Well, by that point, they hated her [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5243.76s)]
*  because they finally picked up on the fact [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5245.0s)]
*  that she was against their whole agenda. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5247.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5248.88s)]
*  But- [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5249.72s)]
*  And she took out one of their star people. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5251.400000000001s)]
*  Well, she's tough and she's great. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5255.24s)]
*  She's genuinely tough. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5257.32s)]
*  She believes in things. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5258.16s)]
*  She's not fake tough like Kamala Harris, right? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5259.0s)]
*  It's like on the verge of tears [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5260.96s)]
*  when Brett Baier asks her a question, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5262.92s)]
*  it's like, oh my gosh. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5264.68s)]
*  So Jill Biden is very famous in DC. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5266.92s)]
*  This is a product of my reporting [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5269.84s)]
*  from living down the street from her, [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5271.08s)]
*  as like a real bitch, as someone who's tough and nasty. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5273.12s)]
*  And I always have- [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5278.32s)]
*  Tough girl from Philly. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5280.16s)]
*  And she's on the record saying, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5281.4s)]
*  I am willing to forget the attacks, [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5283.08s)]
*  but I will never forgive. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5287.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5289.36s)]
*  I mean, she's that, I mean, that's certainly, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5290.2s)]
*  her reputation in DC over the 35 years [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5293.76s)]
*  I lived in the same city as her, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5297.400000000001s)]
*  she was definitely regarded as a bitch. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5298.64s)]
*  So I always wondered, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5301.96s)]
*  how did she get along with Kamala Harris? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5303.040000000001s)]
*  Now, I don't think they ever got along. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5305.200000000001s)]
*  I think, and it was very clear in events, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5307.400000000001s)]
*  they say the things like, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5309.72s)]
*  we're so proud of you, thank you Kamala. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5311.52s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, right. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5313.160000000001s)]
*  When she was selected, [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5314.360000000001s)]
*  Jill Biden was there to offer cookies [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5316.76s)]
*  and pretend that everything's normal. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5319.120000000001s)]
*  But yeah, you don't forget those kinds of attacks [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5320.96s)]
*  against your husband. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5323.56s)]
*  Good for her, by the way, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5325.52s)]
*  I'm on Dr. Jill's side on that one. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5326.36s)]
*  Right, you're obviously part of, [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5328.36s)]
*  have been in politics for a very long time. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5331.16s)]
*  So you're used to people attacking your husband. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5333.16s)]
*  And certainly with Joe Biden, he was attacked for, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5335.92s)]
*  he always wanted to be president [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5338.68s)]
*  and he was always pushed aside by the elites. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5340.08s)]
*  So she did have a chip on her shoulder. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5342.2s)]
*  Yeah, fair. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5343.84s)]
*  Yeah, and even Joe Biden himself. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5345.12s)]
*  I mean, when they finally reached this position, [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5346.64s)]
*  they are people who were repeatedly thrust [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5349.32s)]
*  out of the conversation and pushed aside [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5351.799999999999s)]
*  and mocked and belittled until they needed him. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5353.759999999999s)]
*  And so, oh, but wait, you get four years [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5357.92s)]
*  and then it's time for you to go, we're done with you. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5361.28s)]
*  So what happened, I mean, this just happened this summer. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5365.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5367.799999999999s)]
*  But it's maybe because it did just happen, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5368.639999999999s)]
*  it's hard to understand exactly what that was. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5370.679999999999s)]
*  Like, what do you think that was? [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5375.24s)]
*  And did Kamala Harris have a role? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5376.599999999999s)]
*  I assume she had a role in pushing Biden out, of course. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5378.04s)]
*  Right, the official narrative is that, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5381.12s)]
*  she woke up one morning and had pancakes and bacon [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5383.6s)]
*  with her nieces and was working on a puzzle. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5386.72s)]
*  And Joe Biden called her out of the blue and said, [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5389.36s)]
*  I'm getting out of the race [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5391.84s)]
*  and I'm going to endorse you for president. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5394.12s)]
*  And then she jumped and got on the phone [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5395.76s)]
*  and within 12 hours on the phone, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5399.16s)]
*  she wrapped up the entire nomination. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5401.52s)]
*  That's the story? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5404.24s)]
*  That's the official story. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5405.08s)]
*  Is it actually? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5406.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5407.2s)]
*  So this is the- [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5408.04s)]
*  She single-handedly got on the phone [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5408.88s)]
*  eating anchovy pizza and sweats, wearing her sweats [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5410.44s)]
*  and made enough phone calls to where she could wrap up [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5415.32s)]
*  the entire nomination in a day. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5417.48s)]
*  So this is the Soviet. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5419.639999999999s)]
*  That's the official. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5420.92s)]
*  That's the official narrative. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5421.76s)]
*  They just tell lies that are so absurd. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5422.599999999999s)]
*  They know we're not going to believe them, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5425.4s)]
*  but they don't care. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5427.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5428.12s)]
*  They have actually, I missed all this. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5428.96s)]
*  That was the story they told. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5431.4s)]
*  That's sort of the official story. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5432.24s)]
*  Well, that's just Soviet. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5434.72s)]
*  I mean, that's just absolutely crazy. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5435.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5437.72s)]
*  But we know for three weeks, maybe four, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5438.92s)]
*  from after the debate in June to the day [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5442.56s)]
*  that Joe Biden announced that he was stepping down, [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5445.2s)]
*  there was a furious amount of activity behind the scenes. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5448.84s)]
*  Pelosi, Schumer. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5451.88s)]
*  And you know that Kamala Harris has to publicly [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5454.04s)]
*  backing Joe the whole way, [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5459.08s)]
*  but what are her people doing behind the scenes? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5461.64s)]
*  Is there no effort to sort of make sure [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5464.24s)]
*  that you're being considered? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5467.76s)]
*  Come on. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5469.04s)]
*  To be his heir, which is your rightful position. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5469.88s)]
*  These are politicians. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5472.5599999999995s)]
*  Politics is what they do. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5473.639999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5474.96s)]
*  I mean, that's why they got into this. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5475.8s)]
*  That's how their brains work. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5476.639999999999s)]
*  There's people behind you who are working. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5477.48s)]
*  Of course. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5479.679999999999s)]
*  Of course you can claim deniability. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5481.08s)]
*  I was doing nothing. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5482.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5483.8s)]
*  There's people who support you, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5484.639999999999s)]
*  who will get power from you if you were elected [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5485.599999999999s)]
*  that are working on your behalf. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5489.76s)]
*  That just happens organically [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5491.0s)]
*  out of our political system, right? [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5492.96s)]
*  It's been going on for generations. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5495.48s)]
*  So you have to imagine that there was always going to be [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5497.96s)]
*  this idea that there might be an actual convention [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5501.88s)]
*  where we go and choose the candidate that we want. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5507.12s)]
*  There might be a democratic process. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5510.44s)]
*  Yeah, like a democratic process. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5512.4s)]
*  What do they call it? [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5513.72s)]
*  A brokered convention? [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5514.56s)]
*  Or democracy, I think they call it. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5515.84s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5517.56s)]
*  Because it's so fragile, so very fragile, [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5518.72s)]
*  but so very strong. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5520.6s)]
*  Well, that obviously doesn't exist. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5524.12s)]
*  If your presidential candidate gets the job [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5526.0s)]
*  without anyone voting on it, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5528.8s)]
*  then you don't have democracy. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5530.0s)]
*  Right, so I think that Pelosi and people [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5531.72s)]
*  did want to see a choice, [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5534.56s)]
*  because they had hoped that the strongest candidate [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5536.96s)]
*  would emerge. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5539.16s)]
*  I think a lot of the reason why Biden ran for reelection [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5540.0s)]
*  in the first place is because he and many [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5542.16s)]
*  in the Democratic Party, and certainly in 2023, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5544.280000000001s)]
*  nobody thought that Kamala Harris could win [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5547.88s)]
*  a race for president against Donald Trump. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5551.24s)]
*  Not even win a primary, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5555.6s)]
*  they just didn't think he was ready. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5557.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5558.96s)]
*  And that's what's so fascinating, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5559.8s)]
*  when I published the book, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5561.8s)]
*  a lot of what I was reporting and researching was 23 in DC [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5564.24s)]
*  when Washington, DC had thoroughly rejected her [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5568.68s)]
*  and we're even having conversations of, [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5572.6s)]
*  why not get rid of her entirely on the ticket? [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5574.52s)]
*  I mean, she needs somebody else [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5576.6s)]
*  if Joe Biden's gonna win again. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5577.400000000001s)]
*  So that we went from there, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5579.64s)]
*  I mean, Washington's cruel, right? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5581.68s)]
*  You show up and you are not ready and you make mistakes [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5583.240000000001s)]
*  as she clearly did during her first three years, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5587.68s)]
*  and that's pretty well chronicle, [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5590.160000000001s)]
*  then they turn on you. [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5592.360000000001s)]
*  They don't see you as valuable. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5593.56s)]
*  And they had officially, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5595.160000000001s)]
*  most of Washington thought she was a complete joke. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5596.4400000000005s)]
*  She didn't have, you know, there's not like these defenders [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5599.52s)]
*  or people who actually want to see you succeed in Washington, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5603.5199999999995s)]
*  they're all rooting for your failure [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5607.16s)]
*  and they only respect you if you prove them wrong. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5608.5199999999995s)]
*  And Colin Harris clearly wasn't proving them wrong [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5611.28s)]
*  at this point in 23. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5613.4s)]
*  So when she's ultimately kept on the ticket, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5615.919999999999s)]
*  it's for obvious reasons, [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5618.0s)]
*  like we can't just kick her aside [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5619.16s)]
*  and bring Gretchen Whitmer in to save the day [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5620.919999999999s)]
*  to run with Joe Biden. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5624.08s)]
*  Right, it's tough. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5625.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's tough. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5626.5599999999995s)]
*  You're beheld by the same identity politics [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5627.719999999999s)]
*  that you embrace to get her to this position. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5630.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5634.44s)]
*  You're hung by your own petard. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5636.4s)]
*  Yes, that is, I mean, it was obvious this was gonna happen. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5637.639999999999s)]
*  I wasn't surprised at all. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5641.2s)]
*  I was a little surprised that she picked Tim Walz. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5642.959999999999s)]
*  If you want a gay guy, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5648.16s)]
*  why not just go with Pete Buttigieg? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5649.599999999999s)]
*  What was the thinking there? [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5652.0s)]
*  I don't know too much other than what's been reported, right? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5656.24s)]
*  It's just that ultimately she selected Tim Walz. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5659.44s)]
*  She had a prior relationship. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5662.44s)]
*  In fact, Tim Walz first appeared on the campaign trail [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5663.799999999999s)]
*  when she went to Minnesota to visit a Planned Parenthood clinic [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5666.639999999999s)]
*  for being the historic first vice president [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5670.799999999999s)]
*  to actually campaign at a Planned Parenthood clinic. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5674.08s)]
*  At an abortion clinic. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5676.48s)]
*  Tim Walz was right there cheering her on. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5677.32s)]
*  Kind of wholesome, uplifting deal. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5679.36s)]
*  Right, like this is what we're for. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5681.12s)]
*  These are totally normal people. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5682.799999999999s)]
*  Right, and so I think that she met him there [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5684.2s)]
*  and at various points in her career [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5688.28s)]
*  and found him to be an entertaining figure, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5691.04s)]
*  likeable figure, right? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5693.6s)]
*  Entertainment figure. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5694.92s)]
*  You know, we met at an abortion clinic and- [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5696.360000000001s)]
*  Got along real well. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5699.12s)]
*  He seemed kind of fussy and bubbly [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5700.04s)]
*  and so I thought I would pick him. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5701.64s)]
*  They actually met at an abortion clinic. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5703.8s)]
*  I don't know if that's the first time [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5705.64s)]
*  but that was definitely a pivotal moment, right? [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5706.88s)]
*  It was like- [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5709.12s)]
*  This is, okay. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5709.96s)]
*  Wow, I didn't know that. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5713.320000000001s)]
*  It's one of the first times you see Tim Walz on camera, [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5716.04s)]
*  which I didn't recognize him at the time, [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5718.52s)]
*  but going back and looking at her speeches there, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5720.44s)]
*  he's right behind her clapping the whole time. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  So you know, you assess people by what they do [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5724.719999999999s)]
*  but also by their relationships, who are they close to? [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5727.2s)]
*  And in her case, I'm looking at the men in her life [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5730.639999999999s)]
*  and I see, well, obviously Montell Williams [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5734.08s)]
*  and Willie Brown. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5737.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5739.0s)]
*  I know both of them. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5739.84s)]
*  I like them both better than the men currently in her life [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5741.44s)]
*  but the men now in her life would be her dad, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5743.88s)]
*  who is not in her life. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5746.639999999999s)]
*  Not in her life. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5747.48s)]
*  Writing an op-ed attacking her, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5748.36s)]
*  not invited to her own inaugural. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5749.5599999999995s)]
*  You see Tim Walz, who is, you know, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5752.32s)]
*  like a sort of gay friend or whatever, but creepy guy, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5756.12s)]
*  hanging out at abortion clinics together. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5759.36s)]
*  And then you see her husband, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5761.32s)]
*  the nanny impregnator who smacked a woman in the face. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5765.48s)]
*  What is that? [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5770.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5771.679999999999s)]
*  When I did the reporting for the book, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5772.679999999999s)]
*  and I certainly did not pick up on this, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5774.2s)]
*  but in Washington at the time, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5776.92s)]
*  he was widely celebrated, widely liked. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5778.32s)]
*  They really, people in Washington, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5780.88s)]
*  people in Washington DC really liked Doug Emhoff. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5782.68s)]
*  They thought he was this gregarious, fun character. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5784.68s)]
*  He looks like it actually. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5787.32s)]
*  Loved being in power and was just like, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5788.16s)]
*  a golfer. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5789.96s)]
*  Doing the best he could to back up Kamala Harris. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5790.8s)]
*  And he would do all of these panels [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5793.6s)]
*  about how his number one job was to, you know, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5795.24s)]
*  defend this idea of having a strong woman in office. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5798.32s)]
*  Well, they love the beta male. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5802.16s)]
*  And it's always the beta male [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5803.68s)]
*  who's punching women in the face, but whatever. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5804.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5807.16s)]
*  But where did she meet him? [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5808.0s)]
*  Unfortunate. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5808.84s)]
*  What is that? [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5809.68s)]
*  I think it was right as she ran, [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5813.400000000001s)]
*  right after she won her second term. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5816.84s)]
*  Well, it would have been in 2014, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5819.92s)]
*  but right as she's getting ready to go national. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5822.6s)]
*  And she talks about in her book, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5825.24s)]
*  how it wasn't easy to be a political figure, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5826.400000000001s)]
*  being a single woman. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5829.320000000001s)]
*  Talks about how she was treated differently [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5831.360000000001s)]
*  and how it was a struggle. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5833.4400000000005s)]
*  So I do think ultimately she, you know, [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5834.48s)]
*  I'm sure they had a great dating relationship [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5836.919999999999s)]
*  and that they found nothing common to where they felt that, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5839.24s)]
*  you know, it was worth pursuing. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5843.32s)]
*  Do you think she let him smack her around? [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5845.799999999999s)]
*  I don't see that. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5847.919999999999s)]
*  No. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5848.759999999999s)]
*  I think Doug's been sufficiently. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5849.839999999999s)]
*  Tamed. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5852.08s)]
*  Kept in his place. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5852.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, he's been tamed by the, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5853.759999999999s)]
*  despite all the reporting of who Doug was before, [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5855.2s)]
*  like he has definitely been put in his place [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5858.679999999999s)]
*  and realizes his job. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5861.4s)]
*  He's enjoying the benefits of being a man [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5864.959999999999s)]
*  who supports strong women. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5868.48s)]
*  And I think that's why a lot of people, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5870.2s)]
*  I think that was a step too far for a lot of the people [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5872.36s)]
*  that spoke to the Daily Mail. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5874.32s)]
*  It's like, no, you are not this. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5875.48s)]
*  But they all are. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5878.48s)]
*  Any male feminist has probably hit a woman. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5879.32s)]
*  I mean, that's the whole point of being a male feminist [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5881.08s)]
*  is to hide the fact that you treat women like that. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5883.08s)]
*  Hide the fact that you're a monster, right? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5884.5199999999995s)]
*  100%. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5886.24s)]
*  Obviously, every woman knows that by the way, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5887.44s)]
*  if you just ask a woman, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5890.12s)]
*  who are the men to be afraid of [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5891.959999999999s)]
*  is the one who's always telling you how. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5893.24s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5894.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5895.76s)]
*  Any man who describes himself as a feminist [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5896.599999999999s)]
*  is probably a physical danger to you. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5898.96s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5900.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, I'm from California, so I've seen this my whole life. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5902.599999999999s)]
*  And you lived in Washington, DC for a very long time. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5905.76s)]
*  But Emhoff, did they publicly date? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5907.96s)]
*  I missed all this. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5912.36s)]
*  Were they, was it well known that they were dating? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5913.48s)]
*  Was he a big political figure in California? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5916.5199999999995s)]
*  Who is he? [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5918.8s)]
*  No, he's an entertainment lawyer. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5919.639999999999s)]
*  And so he was connected by one of Kamala's friends. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5921.88s)]
*  And I think that they ended up together [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5924.92s)]
*  because obviously it's very good in this time of your life [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5930.2s)]
*  to not be a single person. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5933.6s)]
*  I think that's, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5935.08s)]
*  especially if you're pursuing higher office, [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5935.92s)]
*  you don't wanna be a single person. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5937.68s)]
*  And you know. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5939.56s)]
*  And you shouldn't be. [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5941.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5942.32s)]
*  And I'm not saying this in a mean way, [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5943.16s)]
*  just honestly, that kind of job is so hard [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5944.32s)]
*  if you're not gonna have somebody in your corner. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5947.56s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5949.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5950.2s)]
*  I'm sympathetic to Kamala Harrison that way for sure. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5951.2s)]
*  And they very much talk about Doug as being this figure. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5954.32s)]
*  Someone she can come home and vent to and talk to. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5957.5199999999995s)]
*  Even though she made the decision to go [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5963.24s)]
*  basically be the president when he's at SoulCycle [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5965.4s)]
*  exercising with friends, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5968.76s)]
*  and he doesn't find out until he gets back to his car. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5970.04s)]
*  No, he admitted being at SoulCycle with his gay friends. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5972.92s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5976.76s)]
*  And he said he didn't find- [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5978.24s)]
*  Is this real? [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5979.08s)]
*  I mean, how could it not? [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5981.0s)]
*  It just... [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5982.16s)]
*  I was- [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5984.68s)]
*  Where else would you be? [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5985.5199999999995s)]
*  How can you, like there has to be obvious evidence of that. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5986.36s)]
*  You wouldn't make up that story. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5989.5599999999995s)]
*  It's just so unbelievable. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5991.8s)]
*  Imagine yourself saying that. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5992.96s)]
*  When my wife got the nod [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5994.48s)]
*  that she was gonna run for president, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5996.72s)]
*  I was at SoulCycle with my gay friends. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=5998.0s)]
*  And I- [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6000.12s)]
*  I think he said that. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6000.96s)]
*  That's what he said. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6001.8s)]
*  And then he said, when I got back to my car, [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6002.64s)]
*  I picked up my phone and called her and she said, [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6003.84s)]
*  where the F have you been? [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6006.36s)]
*  Man, if one of my college roommates did something like that, [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6008.68s)]
*  I would call him up and say, what are you thinking? [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6011.04s)]
*  Seriously, wouldn't you? [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6013.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6016.0s)]
*  I would say, what? [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6017.400000000001s)]
*  And certainly, yeah. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6020.12s)]
*  I mean, it seems like she very much made the decision [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6021.16s)]
*  on her own without time to think about it [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6023.52s)]
*  with friends and family. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6026.400000000001s)]
*  Maybe they had had this discussion beforehand [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6027.28s)]
*  that if she ever got the call, she could just go for it. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6029.52s)]
*  But isn't there- [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6033.360000000001s)]
*  Doesn't sound like much. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6034.68s)]
*  Most politicians are like, well, I gotta think about it [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6035.52s)]
*  with friends and family before I make this. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6036.96s)]
*  No, you gotta talk to your husband. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6038.72s)]
*  Right, your spouse. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6040.92s)]
*  Yeah, or your wife. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6042.12s)]
*  Right? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6043.64s)]
*  Right. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6044.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, not friends and family, your spouse, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6045.32s)]
*  the person you're married to. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6046.52s)]
*  At least your spouse, right? [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6047.36s)]
*  And then your kids, they don't have kids. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6048.8s)]
*  She doesn't have kids, but yeah. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6050.84s)]
*  Then I guess your friends and family, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6053.68s)]
*  but your spouse is the first person you talk to. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6054.76s)]
*  At least you should have a phone call [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6057.12s)]
*  before you accept it, but. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6058.08s)]
*  We both should be on the same page [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6059.72s)]
*  or you're not really married, right? [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6061.56s)]
*  Well, obviously. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6063.2s)]
*  These are obvious things to non-political people. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6064.96s)]
*  It's not just Kamala Harris. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6067.08s)]
*  She's not the only one with fake marriage and politics, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6068.04s)]
*  like most of them seem to have those. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6070.96s)]
*  But I just wanna say that out loud [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6072.52s)]
*  because it is really sick. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6075.12s)]
*  It's not normal. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6076.64s)]
*  And we should just acknowledge that. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6078.04s)]
*  So we remember what normal is. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6079.68s)]
*  Normal is when you have a marriage, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6080.84s)]
*  it's a partnership, a full partnership, [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6082.36s)]
*  where if you're gonna make a major life decision, [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6084.12s)]
*  you talk it over with your spouse. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6086.04s)]
*  That's my experience. [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6087.32s)]
*  Well, of course, or else it's not a real marriage. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6088.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6090.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, is that the whole point of marriage? [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6092.04s)]
*  I think so. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6093.36s)]
*  You thought so? [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6094.2s)]
*  Right. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6095.04s)]
*  Well, it is. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6095.88s)]
*  I'm not very familiar with sort of the marriages [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6096.72s)]
*  that you're describing. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6100.16s)]
*  Well, that's just a roommate situation. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6102.92s)]
*  So, wow. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6104.32s)]
*  These stories came out in your paper. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6106.76s)]
*  Can you just describe, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6108.84s)]
*  maybe people haven't been reading The Daily Mail. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6110.12s)]
*  So what are the stories that we've, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6112.36s)]
*  what have we learned about Doug Emhoff? [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6114.12s)]
*  Right, that he had this relationship [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6116.2s)]
*  with this pretty professional, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6118.2s)]
*  pretty successful female lawyer [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6119.88s)]
*  and that he struck her in the face [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6122.04s)]
*  when they were at a public event together. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6124.28s)]
*  And then afterwards, he kind of forced his way [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6126.5199999999995s)]
*  into her taxi, even after the incident, [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6129.72s)]
*  and basically was like, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6133.08s)]
*  well, this is just the product of our relationship. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6134.08s)]
*  And this woman is clearly very upset, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6139.36s)]
*  very frightened by what he's done, [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6141.96s)]
*  but he doesn't necessarily, it's not, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6146.12s)]
*  let's, there's no attempt to heal, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6149.08s)]
*  or it just seems like it's the product [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6153.28s)]
*  of what happened that night. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6155.44s)]
*  And he certainly doesn't seem to repented from that, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6156.64s)]
*  certainly not publicly. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6159.64s)]
*  Okay, so the bottom line is he was dating a woman [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6160.76s)]
*  there in Cannes, France, South of France, [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6164.48s)]
*  at the film festival, but it's some AIDS event, [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6166.96s)]
*  as I remember. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6169.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6170.88s)]
*  And he hits her in the face, waiting out of jealousy, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6171.96s)]
*  she says, waiting for their car in the Valley line. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6175.08s)]
*  I think that's the allegation. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6179.76s)]
*  Is it real? [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6181.64s)]
*  I mean, it's October of an election year. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6182.68s)]
*  Do you believe that's a real story? [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6184.08s)]
*  Certainly, like the evidence that we've gathered [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6186.76s)]
*  in the testimony, the evidence from that night [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6189.28s)]
*  is certainly more real than any other accusation [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6193.88s)]
*  we've heard about a lot of men politicians recently. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6196.08s)]
*  Really? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6200.72s)]
*  Can you imagine if maybe somebody accused Mike Pence [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6202.5199999999995s)]
*  of doing that, right? [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6206.68s)]
*  Would the media actually care about that? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6208.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6212.36s)]
*  Mike Pence is a whole nother story, man. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6215.36s)]
*  I don't know what to think there. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6217.04s)]
*  Or any other... [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6218.8s)]
*  No, no, of course, no, I see your point, [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6219.72s)]
*  that if the partisan positions were switched, [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6221.36s)]
*  of course it would be... [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6223.8s)]
*  If Donald Trump Jr. was slapping women in the face, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6224.64s)]
*  would that be a big story? [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6227.04s)]
*  Really hard, spinning her around with his hand. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6228.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6231.44s)]
*  But when you say testimony, can you tell us what that is? [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6232.28s)]
*  You talked to other people who were there. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6235.16s)]
*  Well, it wasn't my story at the Daily Mail, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6236.76s)]
*  but yeah, the reporters who worked on the story [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6239.4400000000005s)]
*  and the editors who worked on the story [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6242.12s)]
*  spoke with a lot of witnesses about what had happened, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6245.2s)]
*  who recall that day, the day that she called them [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6248.64s)]
*  to tell them what happened, [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6253.08s)]
*  and this corroborated evidence [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6254.8s)]
*  with evidence of the flight ticket. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6257.8s)]
*  There's certainly enough there. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6260.280000000001s)]
*  And you had a great conversation with Megyn Kelly, [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6261.4800000000005s)]
*  who came away, you know, [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6263.88s)]
*  Megyn Kelly's pretty a sharp lawyer, right? [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6265.2s)]
*  She came away saying... [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6267.6s)]
*  She's very sharp, yeah. [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6268.68s)]
*  It was very interesting to hear her talk about it [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6270.360000000001s)]
*  and say, you know, I believe it all. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6272.320000000001s)]
*  But she's, A, experienced these type of men [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6274.2s)]
*  that do these things, and B, knows enough to smell [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6276.8s)]
*  whether or not a story is fake. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6282.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's, I guess... [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6283.56s)]
*  And who does he go to to sort of wipe it all away? [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6285.28s)]
*  Joe Scarborough, who's in the same VC. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6288.24s)]
*  That is so funny. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6290.24s)]
*  Joe Scarborough. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6291.56s)]
*  Joe Scarborough's like, [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6292.5599999999995s)]
*  well, what about all this stuff in the tabloids? [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6293.4s)]
*  And Doug Emhoff just looks them straight in the eyes, [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6297.04s)]
*  like we can't get distracted from our mission here. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6299.44s)]
*  Oh, so Emhoff never denied it? [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6303.5599999999995s)]
*  No. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6305.2s)]
*  I think his team did in some passive language, [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6306.04s)]
*  but he certainly hasn't, personally. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6309.24s)]
*  So, but bottom line, you're convinced, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6312.5199999999995s)]
*  and again, you work at the publication [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6315.44s)]
*  that ran this story, that this is a real person, [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6317.08s)]
*  and your reporters... [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6320.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, I've heard people say, oh, we know who this woman is. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6321.68s)]
*  Like if the mainstream media was actually concerned [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6324.88s)]
*  about validating the story, they could pursue it. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6329.0s)]
*  But as is often the case, [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6334.0s)]
*  when you have an uncomfortable narrative [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6336.4400000000005s)]
*  or in the last days of an election, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6338.16s)]
*  you know, I guess we didn't get censored, right? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6341.4400000000005s)]
*  We didn't, they didn't call it Russian disinformation [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6343.92s)]
*  and ban us from social media. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6347.200000000001s)]
*  I think they're trying to just make it go away. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6349.84s)]
*  They really would like it to go away. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6351.84s)]
*  Yeah, of course, which it will. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6353.320000000001s)]
*  And the fact that you're talking about it [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6354.16s)]
*  and Megyn Kelly is talking about it [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6355.72s)]
*  is very inconvenient for their campaign. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6357.16s)]
*  You know, it's just, look, I just wanna be consistent, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6359.4400000000005s)]
*  however, I don't like Doug Emhoff's politics. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6362.4400000000005s)]
*  I feel sorry for him, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6364.52s)]
*  just because his life seems depressing, [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6367.16s)]
*  but I don't like his politics. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6368.88s)]
*  But I also know that there have been a lot of people [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6370.96s)]
*  whose politics I also don't like, [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6372.84s)]
*  who've been destroyed by false accusations [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6374.68s)]
*  of sexual harassment, physical abuse. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6377.04s)]
*  Like there's a lot of falseness around MeToo claims, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6380.28s)]
*  including people I know, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6386.44s)]
*  and had one of them on the other day, Mark Alperin. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6388.36s)]
*  And so I just wanna be fair. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6392.56s)]
*  And I'm also really uncomfortable with any accusation [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6395.36s)]
*  from an anonymous source against someone we name. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6398.12s)]
*  Like, so we name the person who's been accused, [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6400.4s)]
*  but we don't name the accuser. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6402.76s)]
*  I just wanna say for the record, [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6404.0s)]
*  I think that's immoral. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6405.48s)]
*  I don't think we should have anonymous accusations, [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6407.08s)]
*  but whatever, it seems very common now. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6408.759999999999s)]
*  But I just wanna make sure that that, [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6411.5199999999995s)]
*  so you believe they know who this is, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6414.879999999999s)]
*  and this seems like a real thing? [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6416.839999999999s)]
*  Right, I do believe it. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6418.32s)]
*  And when you have multiple witnesses [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6419.759999999999s)]
*  that are willing to say something, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6421.24s)]
*  it means that they're deeply upset by what happened. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6422.36s)]
*  And not only that, they're deeply upset [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6424.679999999999s)]
*  by the person he's being betrayed as like a champion of- [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6426.04s)]
*  And they saw it happen. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6427.96s)]
*  Witnesses, you interviewed, [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6429.679999999999s)]
*  your paper interviewed witnesses who saw it happen. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6431.16s)]
*  I think that they were witnesses who were there [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6433.0s)]
*  who the woman talked to, right? [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6435.6s)]
*  Wow. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6437.32s)]
*  The woman who, you know, this isn't, [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6438.16s)]
*  this isn't, you know, we can't be too cavalier, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6441.24s)]
*  but this isn't a Christine Blasey Ford accusation. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6443.44s)]
*  This is something where multiple people are- [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6446.6s)]
*  And it wasn't 40 years ago. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6449.64s)]
*  Right, this is something that happened very recently. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6451.8s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6454.04s)]
*  Do you think that story has penetrated at all? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6455.64s)]
*  Well, certainly you and Megan have talked about a lot. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6458.44s)]
*  Yeah, bitch. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6460.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6461.6s)]
*  And Donald Trump made a joke about it. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6463.88s)]
*  Well, not about the violence story, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6465.12s)]
*  but he made a joke about the nanny story. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6468.4800000000005s)]
*  So that story is that Emhoff impregnated his nanny. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6470.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6473.64s)]
*  And that just seems like a fact. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6474.4800000000005s)]
*  He actually addressed it and said that yes, it happened. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6476.16s)]
*  Has Kamala said anything about it? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6483.24s)]
*  No. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6486.4400000000005s)]
*  It's very, it's one of those stories, right? [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6488.4s)]
*  You don't ask about that. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6490.96s)]
*  If you ever want to get an interview [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6493.84s)]
*  with Kamala Harris again, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6494.68s)]
*  that's not something you bring up, right? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6495.68s)]
*  So certainly a lot of media figures [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6498.04s)]
*  aren't interested in asking about that story. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6499.72s)]
*  How do you assess the coverage of her, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6503.04s)]
*  just kind of meta question here as a reporter, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6505.400000000001s)]
*  as someone who's really tried to cover Kamala Harris? [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6507.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I've kind of, you know, [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6511.4400000000005s)]
*  because I remember Obama and I remember how the media was, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6513.8s)]
*  how they acted during the Obama administration. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6518.8s)]
*  And if they had actually held them accountable [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6522.12s)]
*  on a few things, then it might've gone better. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6523.76s)]
*  I think as a journalist, [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6526.48s)]
*  you kind of want to just hold people accountable [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6528.04s)]
*  and puncture through like their false narratives, [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6531.36s)]
*  reveal who they really are, kind of expose their weaknesses, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6534.16s)]
*  warn the American people like, [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6538.16s)]
*  this is the type of person that you would vote for. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6539.72s)]
*  This is how they act behind the scenes. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6542.68s)]
*  This is who they really are. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6544.64s)]
*  We're not gonna let the politician tell their own story. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6547.04s)]
*  That's not good for America. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6549.44s)]
*  That's not good for democracy. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6551.24s)]
*  You have to know the full story [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6552.88s)]
*  and you have to have impartial people looking into it. [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6555.4s)]
*  But Kamala Harris as a hero of the civil rights movement [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6557.639999999999s)]
*  has exclusive rights to her own story, right? [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6562.2s)]
*  You don't get to tell her story. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6565.12s)]
*  Right, and you can write your book. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6566.24s)]
*  Every politician writes a book [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6567.679999999999s)]
*  before they run for a higher office. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6569.36s)]
*  Look at Ron DeSantis, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6571.4s)]
*  he published a book telling his whole story. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6572.4s)]
*  But we don't just take the biography [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6574.72s)]
*  and run with it as the next American icon, [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6576.679999999999s)]
*  they have to earn that. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6579.32s)]
*  And certainly... [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6581.28s)]
*  Well, we get to ask questions, don't we? [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6582.44s)]
*  That's what we like to do, I think. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6585.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6587.44s)]
*  Actually uncover interesting things about people [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6588.5199999999995s)]
*  and paint a bigger portrait [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6592.16s)]
*  than just the one that's on their campaign ad, [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6594.32s)]
*  their campaign slogan. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6596.28s)]
*  So I do find that very rewarding. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6598.24s)]
*  I think every journalist should find that rewarding. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6600.5599999999995s)]
*  Like who is the real Kamala Harris? [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6602.16s)]
*  What does she believe in? [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6603.639999999999s)]
*  Turns out not much. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6605.0s)]
*  If there's any issue she's never changed her position on [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6607.48s)]
*  or one issue she actually cares about [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6612.04s)]
*  and can speak passionately about, it's abortion. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6613.28s)]
*  I think that's her number one. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6616.2s)]
*  Why do you think she's so... [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6618.2s)]
*  It's a little issue. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6619.04s)]
*  Is this someone who never had children [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6619.88s)]
*  and not attacking her? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6620.92s)]
*  I feel sorry for her. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6621.76s)]
*  Children are a source of joy, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6622.92s)]
*  really the only enduring source of joy. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6624.0s)]
*  So speaking of joy, [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6625.96s)]
*  I'm definitely not attacking her for that at all. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6628.5199999999995s)]
*  I feel really bad for her. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6631.08s)]
*  But why, but it's just interesting [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6633.16s)]
*  that someone who never had kids [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6635.12s)]
*  would be so committed to abortion. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6636.28s)]
*  Like what do you think that is? [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6638.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6639.5599999999995s)]
*  It's obviously something that she has dealt with. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6641.96s)]
*  She's obviously had people in her life [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6643.72s)]
*  who have dealt with this. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6646.16s)]
*  Has she had an abortion? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6647.0s)]
*  Has anyone asked her? [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6648.12s)]
*  She's never publicly said anything about it. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6649.6s)]
*  And nobody's asked her. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6652.48s)]
*  She's constantly talking about other people's abortions [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6653.32s)]
*  and abortion, abortion, abortion, abortion. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6655.56s)]
*  Why is it out of bounds to say, [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6657.68s)]
*  hey, have you had an abortion? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6659.6s)]
*  Right, because if you had, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6661.12s)]
*  you would certainly expect that you would be this, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6662.48s)]
*  you would champion that moment [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6665.4s)]
*  since it's the expression of human freedom. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6666.76s)]
*  If I'm running around talking about how we need [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6668.96s)]
*  how you know, subsidized appendectomies, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6671.88s)]
*  then I think it's fair to say [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6674.64s)]
*  have you ever had an appendectomy? [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6675.4800000000005s)]
*  If there's nothing to be ashamed of, [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6677.240000000001s)]
*  then why does nobody ask her? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6678.2s)]
*  I don't get that. [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6679.72s)]
*  You know, I'm kind of sick of playing along [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6680.56s)]
*  with all this stuff, I must say. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6681.72s)]
*  All these weird taboos that only serve one political party [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6683.360000000001s)]
*  where there's some things you're supposed to talk about, [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6687.280000000001s)]
*  but only in a certain way. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6689.12s)]
*  Other things you're never allowed to talk about. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6690.2s)]
*  Certain people have a right to tell their own story. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6692.280000000001s)]
*  Other people who have no right to talk at all. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6694.16s)]
*  Like I'm just, who makes these rules? [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6695.92s)]
*  And why are we playing along with them? [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6697.84s)]
*  Right, has any pro-choice woman who is in political office [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6699.8s)]
*  shared her experience of having an abortion? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6705.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I really, just for the record, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6707.52s)]
*  don't want to hear about other people's abortions [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6709.16s)]
*  or abortion at all. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6710.400000000001s)]
*  It's killing, it's super depressing. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6711.24s)]
*  But if it is the act of ultimate human freedom, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6713.08s)]
*  and you campaign on this. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6716.4400000000005s)]
*  But there are other ones who are talking about it [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6718.28s)]
*  constantly, so. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6719.24s)]
*  Maybe you would consider that this would be. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6720.08s)]
*  But if Bret Baier had said to her the other night, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6722.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, Madam Vice President, [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6725.12s)]
*  you talk about abortion, have you ever had one? [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6726.8s)]
*  I mean, I think he would have been fired from his job [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6729.360000000001s)]
*  for saying that. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6731.320000000001s)]
*  And he certainly would become instantly a villain. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6732.56s)]
*  And you sort of wonder like, why? [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6735.320000000001s)]
*  If there's nothing wrong with abortion, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6738.0s)]
*  if you're supposed to shout your abortion. [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6740.0s)]
*  Or like Tim Walz is very obviously gay. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6741.8s)]
*  I look at him and I'm like, well, you're gay. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6745.04s)]
*  And I'm sure I'll be attacked for saying that. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6747.24s)]
*  Maybe he's not gay, but he certainly seems gay. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6749.360000000001s)]
*  Right, and immediately say where's your evidence? [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6751.64s)]
*  I don't have any evidence. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6754.400000000001s)]
*  I'm just saying, I look super, super gay to me. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6755.24s)]
*  But they're the ones always running on being like, [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6757.5599999999995s)]
*  it's great to be gay. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6759.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, if it's great to be gay, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6760.5199999999995s)]
*  then why is it an attack on him for me to say that? [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6761.5199999999995s)]
*  And why would it be out of bounds to be like, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6765.639999999999s)]
*  hey, Tim Walz, you seem super gay, are you gay? [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6767.16s)]
*  Have you ever slept with dudes? [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6769.92s)]
*  Like, if you ask that question, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6771.24s)]
*  you would be fired from your job. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6773.5199999999995s)]
*  You're just asking that now, it's very controversial, right? [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6775.36s)]
*  But why would it be controversial? [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6777.639999999999s)]
*  Because you don't have any evidence. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6778.48s)]
*  If there's nothing wrong with it, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6779.32s)]
*  then why is it so offensive to ask that question? [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6780.92s)]
*  Like, this doesn't make any sense. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6784.2s)]
*  I think ultimately Democrats feel like [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6785.36s)]
*  these issues are very private, [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6787.28s)]
*  which is why they campaign so strongly. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6788.5199999999995s)]
*  They're so private, really? [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6790.2s)]
*  You've got a LGBTQ plus parade in San Francisco, [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6791.64s)]
*  New York, Seattle, every big city in the country, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6797.92s)]
*  people having sex in the street. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6799.44s)]
*  So it's not private. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6800.5199999999995s)]
*  They're telling my kids constantly that it's a good thing. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6802.32s)]
*  So there's nothing private or forbidden [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6806.08s)]
*  or taboo about it now, right? [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6808.4s)]
*  Just to be clear, those are their rules. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6809.8s)]
*  Right, and then you have Tim Walz, [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6810.64s)]
*  who's like, keep the hell out of my bedroom. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6812.2s)]
*  We're the party of privacy. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6814.08s)]
*  If there's nothing wrong with being gay, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6817.04s)]
*  which is certainly in a position, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6818.8s)]
*  in fact, it's morally superior to being heterosexual, [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6819.84s)]
*  obviously they say that in effect. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6822.24s)]
*  If the State Department's pushing it [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6824.84s)]
*  on every country around the world, [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6826.04s)]
*  then why would it be somehow crazy or out of bounds [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6827.28s)]
*  or taboo or offensive for me to say to Tim Walz, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6831.5199999999995s)]
*  you seem gay, it's not an attack, are you gay? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6834.2s)]
*  But you know as well as I do that if I had an employer, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6838.759999999999s)]
*  which I don't, I would immediately be fired for saying it. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6843.599999999999s)]
*  So like, what is that? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6846.759999999999s)]
*  That doesn't make any sense. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6847.84s)]
*  And why are we playing along with it? [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6848.92s)]
*  That's my point. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6850.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not gonna ask that question. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6852.24s)]
*  And by the way, I wouldn't either [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6855.32s)]
*  because I don't really wanna know [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6858.719999999999s)]
*  about Tim Walz's sex life. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6860.96s)]
*  I don't wanna know about anyone's sex life. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6862.599999999999s)]
*  I wanna stop talking about our sex lives actually, [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6864.12s)]
*  immediately. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6866.08s)]
*  And I want the State Department to stop forcing [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6866.92s)]
*  other people in other countries [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6868.96s)]
*  to talk about their sex lives. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6869.96s)]
*  I just wanna declare a truce on race and sex and abortion. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6871.36s)]
*  I don't wanna hear about your abortion. [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6875.16s)]
*  I don't want you to talk about abortion, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6876.96s)]
*  shut up about abortion, about your sex life, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6878.76s)]
*  about your race. [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6881.4800000000005s)]
*  That's the world that I wanna live in. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6882.4800000000005s)]
*  But they're not allowing me to live in that world. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6884.56s)]
*  So as long as they're not allowing me to live in that world, [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6886.72s)]
*  why am I playing along with rules [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6889.4400000000005s)]
*  that are rigged against me? [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6891.24s)]
*  These are fair questions, right? [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6893.8s)]
*  So why don't you ask Tim, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6894.96s)]
*  why don't you ask Tim Walz that question? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6896.0s)]
*  About abortion? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6899.56s)]
*  No, no, just say, hey Tim Walz, you seem gay, [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6900.4s)]
*  not attacking you, [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6902.6s)]
*  but I've seen the video of you doing jazz hands. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6903.84s)]
*  Are you gay? [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6906.56s)]
*  Have you ever had sex with a man? [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6907.4s)]
*  I don't know if I would have enough evidence [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6908.64s)]
*  to make that question reality. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6911.56s)]
*  Just like that, it just seems that way. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6913.48s)]
*  Kind of my impression. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6915.56s)]
*  Are you gay? [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6917.72s)]
*  But that would go badly for you, wouldn't it? [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6919.36s)]
*  Right, I would never ask that question. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6921.44s)]
*  Not all of us have the freedom to ask that question. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6926.16s)]
*  Or the same interest in that question. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6929.64s)]
*  I don't have any interest in it. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6933.08s)]
*  He's the one who's constantly, [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6934.4s)]
*  he's the one who ran a gay straight alliance [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6935.72s)]
*  where he's talking to children about their sex lives. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6937.64s)]
*  So right there, that's a criminal offense in my book. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6940.64s)]
*  You don't get to talk to other people's kids [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6942.84s)]
*  about their sex lives, period, freak. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6944.12s)]
*  But he's bragging about it, okay. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6947.16s)]
*  Why am I barking at you? [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6951.6s)]
*  Charlie, I don't mean to bark at you. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6953.08s)]
*  I don't know, just trying to be rational for a second. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6954.92s)]
*  Yeah, it makes sense. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6958.4800000000005s)]
*  When you look at what our media has become [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6959.8s)]
*  and when you look at the questions that they ask [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6964.040000000001s)]
*  when they get the privilege, [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6967.4800000000005s)]
*  interviewing a presidential candidate is now a privilege [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6969.400000000001s)]
*  bestowed on you and you have to demonstrate [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6972.72s)]
*  that you're worthy on a number of issues. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6975.6s)]
*  The first person that got an interview with Kamala Harris [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6978.96s)]
*  was the woman from MSNBC who publicly said [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6981.96s)]
*  she didn't need to do interviews [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6985.12s)]
*  and then suddenly she gets an interview. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6986.64s)]
*  So that's what our media has become, right? [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6988.24s)]
*  So you're filling me in on so much that I've missed. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6991.4800000000005s)]
*  Who at MSNBC said that Kamala Harris [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6994.16s)]
*  didn't need to do interviews? [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6996.32s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6997.2s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6998.72s)]
*  She was on Bill Maher and said, [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=6999.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris doesn't need to do interviews [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7002.4s)]
*  because it's so obvious that Donald Trump is the worst [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7004.76s)]
*  and that she's the best. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7008.2s)]
*  I mean, I'm paraphrasing. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7009.56s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl, the perky business reporter. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7010.84s)]
*  From MSNBC? [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7013.96s)]
*  Yeah, she was a business reporter last I checked. [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7015.12s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7018.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, she was the first one to ask, [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7019.6s)]
*  she was the first one to get a major, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7022.88s)]
*  well, I guess Dana Bash got the first one, right? [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7025.04s)]
*  With Tim Walz and Kamala Harris. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7027.280000000001s)]
*  But Stephanie Ruhl got the first solo sit down [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7029.84s)]
*  with Kamala Harris, I think that's true. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7032.52s)]
*  And yeah, she publicly said on Bill Maher [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7034.84s)]
*  that why does she even need to do media [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7037.72s)]
*  when it's very obvious that she's the best candidate [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7040.28s)]
*  compared to Trump. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7044.719999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7046.16s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7048.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7050.719999999999s)]
*  She's just so great, we don't need to talk to her. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7051.679999999999s)]
*  That's her position as journalists. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7053.84s)]
*  Right, that's the- [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7055.8s)]
*  And she's the one who got the first interview. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7057.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7058.599999999999s)]
*  I think it's because, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7059.8s)]
*  I think Donald Trump said something nasty about her, [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7061.36s)]
*  so that obviously- [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7063.36s)]
*  About Stephanie Ruhl? [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7064.719999999999s)]
*  Right, which is why you instantly get elevated. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7065.679999999999s)]
*  I don't know Stephanie Ruhl, we did not overlap. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7069.08s)]
*  I once worked there. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7071.12s)]
*  She's got a camera, but I haven't seen her on TV [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7073.599999999999s)]
*  in a long time because I don't have a TV. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7076.16s)]
*  But she- Right, you're free. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7077.72s)]
*  Well, I am kind of free, but I also miss stuff, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7080.44s)]
*  so I'm grateful that you're filling me in. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7082.12s)]
*  That's amazing that she said that. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7083.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7085.8s)]
*  So I just want to boil it down, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7087.24s)]
*  and these are just my perceptions [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7089.36s)]
*  that you can obviously disagree, [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7090.599999999999s)]
*  but I don't think you're likely [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7092.5599999999995s)]
*  to get a Kamala Harris interview. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7094.64s)]
*  Hope Spring's eternal. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7097.0s)]
*  No, that's very true. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7100.92s)]
*  She has, it's been reported [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7101.76s)]
*  that she has an enemies list of reporters [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7103.76s)]
*  because she's very thin-skinned when it comes to coverage. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7105.64s)]
*  She hates anything poorly written. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7109.04s)]
*  And I think one of the biggest examples of that [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7112.08s)]
*  was when she was very angry with the Vogue cover [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7113.8s)]
*  that came out after she won the vice presidency. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7115.92s)]
*  She was very displeased with this Vogue cover [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7117.92s)]
*  of her standing there in her chucks, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7120.68s)]
*  her sneakers. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7124.4800000000005s)]
*  And she was very upset by that. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7126.0s)]
*  It was one of the first controversies of her life. [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7128.16s)]
*  So Vogue was too tough on her? [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7130.0s)]
*  Vogue ran a very racially insensitive, ignorant cover, [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7131.92s)]
*  and she was very displeased by that. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7137.4800000000005s)]
*  Was it a candid? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7139.6s)]
*  She didn't know she was posing for a Vogue photo shoot? [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7140.44s)]
*  No, she was posing. [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7142.36s)]
*  She just didn't know that would be the cover. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7143.2s)]
*  She got to choose the outfits and the background, [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7145.12s)]
*  but that was supposed to be inside the magazine, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7147.92s)]
*  but not the cover. But it was racist [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7149.72s)]
*  to put her on the cover. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7151.2s)]
*  Oh, she was very upset about it. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7152.04s)]
*  People found it very demeaning. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7153.4s)]
*  Were you serious? [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7156.6s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of the biggest controversies [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7157.4400000000005s)]
*  before she even took office. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7158.68s)]
*  This was one of the biggest controversies of her career. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7160.0s)]
*  And even the narcissism of rich people in this country [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7165.0s)]
*  is just, it really doesn't have limits. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7169.04s)]
*  Even the Biden team, communications team was like, [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7170.72s)]
*  can we tone it down a little bit? [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7174.04s)]
*  We don't want this to be the first major controversy [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7175.360000000001s)]
*  of our ministry, we haven't even taken office yet. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7178.360000000001s)]
*  And this is already- [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7181.04s)]
*  What was racially insensitive about it? [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7181.88s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7183.76s)]
*  I think portraying her in a casual manner [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7185.68s)]
*  was something she did not appreciate. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7189.2s)]
*  I thought she was a joyful warrior. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7193.280000000001s)]
*  A joyful casual warrior. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7196.76s)]
*  So you just can't with someone like that. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7198.2s)]
*  Right, but the point is that she has an enemies list [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7202.76s)]
*  of reporters who don't appreciate her rise to power. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7205.4800000000005s)]
*  And any time that they stray from the official [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7208.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris narrative, [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7211.56s)]
*  then she's not gonna do an interview with you. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7212.64s)]
*  Which is why you have so many reporters [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7214.96s)]
*  being very cautious, very careful. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7218.240000000001s)]
*  And she certainly earned that reputation [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7219.92s)]
*  throughout her whole presidential campaign. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7221.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, reporters and editors were very familiar [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7223.400000000001s)]
*  with getting angry responses from the way they covered [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7225.400000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris as a presidential candidate. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7229.0s)]
*  I honestly feel like this is like [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7231.400000000001s)]
*  some kind of weird right-wing parody meant to discredit [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7234.6s)]
*  people like Kamala Harris. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7238.96s)]
*  I mean, she's like living down to every stereotype, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7240.5199999999995s)]
*  but totally fragile, indecisive, narcissistic. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7244.5199999999995s)]
*  This is not the female leadership [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7249.4s)]
*  who are promised at all. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7251.0s)]
*  This is like, this is discrediting. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7252.44s)]
*  Are all politicians narcissistic? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7255.08s)]
*  Yes, pretty much. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7257.2s)]
*  They are, for sure. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7258.48s)]
*  Oh, definitely. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7260.0s)]
*  She's not the only one, I just wanna be clear. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7260.839999999999s)]
*  But also, being thin-skinned, narcissistic, [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7264.0s)]
*  very adamant about how you're covered, [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7268.6s)]
*  and very angry with how you're treated, that's kind of. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7272.280000000001s)]
*  If she called a vogue racist, then we're dealing with like [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7275.320000000001s)]
*  that's the level of fragile. I don't think she actually [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7278.92s)]
*  said that, but people close to her were upset of it [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7280.400000000001s)]
*  for that racism. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7283.52s)]
*  Okay, last question, are you gonna make sure [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7285.92s)]
*  that she sees this interview? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7288.400000000001s)]
*  Do you think she'll watch? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7292.160000000001s)]
*  Is she gonna send this over to her press team? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7293.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think I will, and see if they have any response. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7295.160000000001s)]
*  But ultimately. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7299.080000000001s)]
*  I think that's gonna affect her. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7300.64s)]
*  There's a lot of people who are talking about Kamala Harris [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7301.64s)]
*  in a way that she would not approve of. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7303.92s)]
*  And up until this point, she's decided just to ignore it. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7306.280000000001s)]
*  But I think there's enough people talking about, [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7310.120000000001s)]
*  you've had some great people on, [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7313.240000000001s)]
*  including an attorney from San Francisco, what's her? [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7316.4800000000005s)]
*  Harmeet Dhillon, yeah. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7318.6s)]
*  Harmeet, very, very, she was not a source for the book, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7319.4400000000005s)]
*  but very insightful, growing up in that neighborhood [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7322.68s)]
*  and experiencing Kamala Harris for who she is. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7325.76s)]
*  And I think that's why she's been called Kamala Harris [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7329.08s)]
*  in a very insightful interview. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7331.08s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of people talking about [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7333.08s)]
*  who the real Kamala Harris is, [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7335.08s)]
*  that I think that's why ultimately she feels like [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7336.679999999999s)]
*  she has to come out and do a media tour [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7339.28s)]
*  because she has to distract from the conversations [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7340.84s)]
*  that are actually taking place. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7343.2s)]
*  It's not working well. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7344.76s)]
*  You'd think she'd feel obligated [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7345.96s)]
*  just because that's how democracy works. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7347.4s)]
*  Voters have a right to information about you [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7350.5599999999995s)]
*  before they vote on you. [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7353.16s)]
*  Right. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7354.32s)]
*  But she doesn't feel that way. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7355.16s)]
*  If you lose the power to control the masses [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7356.56s)]
*  and cheerlead for you, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7359.4800000000005s)]
*  even though you don't give them interviews, [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7361.360000000001s)]
*  then what's the benefit? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7364.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we don't have a working, [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7368.76s)]
*  it's just North Korean press agency here. [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7370.400000000001s)]
*  So yeah, well, bless you and the Daily Mail [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7372.6s)]
*  and anyone else who retains a commitment [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7376.56s)]
*  to telling the truth, you know, imperfectly, [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7380.080000000001s)]
*  because we're people, but you know, trying. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7382.64s)]
*  I don't think we can function as a free country without it. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7385.16s)]
*  So I appreciate you're doing it. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7388.92s)]
*  Well, thanks so much for having me. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7390.52s)]
*  Charlie, thank you very much. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7391.52s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7397.68s)]
*  I know. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7401.8s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7402.64s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7405.24s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7406.4800000000005s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7409.2s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7412.4400000000005s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7414.24s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7415.8s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7416.64s)]
*  that's a waste of time, not in charge of Google, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7418.4s)]
*  or we could find a way around it, [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7420.96s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7422.72s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7426.72s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7428.76s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7430.76s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7432.72s)]
*  of hearing what we say, and we hope you will. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ntn8ImrL2E&t=7436.64s)]
