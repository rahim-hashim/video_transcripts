# Conor McGregor’s Presidential Bid, Tariffs, Erasing Irish Culture, and Deporting Rosie O’Donnell
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg)
*  Don McGregor, thanks a lot for having us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=0.0s)]
*  This is one of the great, Dublin's one of the great cities in the world. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3.0s)]
*  For sure. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  The best city in the world. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  You can make a claim to that. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=8.84s)]
*  Walk around Dublin for a day and then think of five better cities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=10.44s)]
*  Not possible. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=13.92s)]
*  It's an amazing place. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=14.92s)]
*  It's an amazing country. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=15.92s)]
*  How's the country doing? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=16.92s)]
*  Like a lot of countries in the Western sphere, it is being governed by people with ill intentions [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=19.92s)]
*  of its people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=26.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=27.6s)]
*  They have not got the interest of their people at its heart. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=28.6s)]
*  However, our country stays strong. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  Our people are strong-willed, strong-minded and we are of amazing spirit. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=34.44s)]
*  And it's about highlighting the issues that are going on and as we have been doing, it's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=39.96s)]
*  turning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=44.6s)]
*  We will get there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=45.6s)]
*  I am not going to sit here in front of you with a doom and gloom about the things that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=46.6s)]
*  are going wrong. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  I will highlight for sure, but I will highlight the solutions and the resolutions and where [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  we are headed and keep the outlook positive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=56.72s)]
*  That is what has worked for me my entire life and my entire career where I was able to rise [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=61.4s)]
*  up and do things that were once considered unattainable. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=66.4s)]
*  I kept a positive outlook and that's what I will urge my citizens and my countrymen, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=69.28s)]
*  my fellow countrymen and women to do. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we are doing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  We had a great moment in the Oval Office with President Trump where we got to speak and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  before the press in the White House where we got to speak our case, it was the first [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=84.68s)]
*  time it had happened in our history really where we felt as a people, someone spoke up [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=89.36s)]
*  about our issues. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=96.48s)]
*  We often hear and very hastily hear about overseas issues or foreign affairs and we [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=97.88s)]
*  hear about it so much that we are left scratching our head, well what about our issues? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=106.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=112.48s)]
*  What about the issues the people of Ireland face? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=113.52000000000001s)]
*  And that is a rising sentiment that is taking place behind the doors of every household [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=116.28s)]
*  in the country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=122.4s)]
*  What about us? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=123.92s)]
*  And right now the citizens of Ireland, not only do we not feel like first-rate citizens, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=125.72s)]
*  we don't even feel like third-rate citizens in our own country. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=131.76s)]
*  So we continue to highlight the wrongdoings of a minute government elite and it is minute. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=135.28s)]
*  And what they are doing, they are using intimidation tactics, they are using bullying tactics, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  they are using diversion tactics, they are using public funds and public wealth to enrich [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=148.84s)]
*  private people and private industries to alter the thinking of the public. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  And we say no more. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  And we are in the midst of highlighting it and continuing our motion towards the betterment [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=166.4s)]
*  of our country and the saving of our great country. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=172.6s)]
*  Ireland is God's country and you will not go against the nation of Ireland. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=175.56s)]
*  We are peaceful, we are not harmless and we will continue this journey onward. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=180.0s)]
*  We are peaceful, we are not harmless. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=185.56s)]
*  Fact. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=187.48s)]
*  Amen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=188.48s)]
*  You could be describing the United States in everything you just said that all the conversations [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=189.48000000000002s)]
*  about foreign policy in our country, it's about the Middle East, who cares, Eastern [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=194.28s)]
*  Europe, double who cares, and very little about what's happening to the people of our [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=198.68s)]
*  country and you feel that here. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=202.88s)]
*  That is, I feel it's even magnified the more here. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=206.24s)]
*  I feel in this administration currently in the United States it seems an America forced [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=209.28s)]
*  stance. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=214.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=215.44s)]
*  And it's a very welcome sight for us over here. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=216.44s)]
*  We wish that for us, Ireland forced. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=220.44s)]
*  I feel and as many of my country men and women feel, there is almost like an incentive to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=223.2s)]
*  speak your piece on foreign issues. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=231.56s)]
*  If you think about a raise or your next job or your next position, that is where we feel [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=236.72s)]
*  our government elite have their eyes on. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=243.04s)]
*  They have their eyes on the next role for themselves and in order to get that next role, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=245.64s)]
*  they must speak their piece on foreign issues and nothing to do with Irish issues. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=252.48s)]
*  And then lo and behold, an announcement of a raise or an employment in the European Union [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  delegates and then off they go on their merry way after a running riot on Ireland and zero [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=265.2s)]
*  accountability of doing so. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=273.0s)]
*  And it's no more. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=275.56s)]
*  I'm not sure where people think they will go in this small island. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=276.56s)]
*  You will not destroy Ireland and be free to walk away. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=279.88s)]
*  And that is a fact. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=284.68s)]
*  How do you, I want to get to how you know all this and how you've distilled it to such [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=286.68s)]
*  a, to its essence. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=291.32s)]
*  I mean, that was such an amazing description, not just to what's happening here, but throughout [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=292.32s)]
*  the West, the English. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=296.64s)]
*  The entire Western sphere for sure is happening. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=297.64s)]
*  Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Great Britain, which has already gone. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=299.8s)]
*  I feel our government again, overseas issues. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=303.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=306.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Internal. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  I love my country dearly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=309.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=310.88s)]
*  Nothing or no one could ever change that fact. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=311.88s)]
*  I would give my life for my nation and I have such a love for this soil and I, how I know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=315.59999999999997s)]
*  about it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  I've just invested in it heavily. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=324.67999999999995s)]
*  You know, I'm an, I'm an employer of many people here in the country, have many businesses [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=326.2s)]
*  here operating in the country and daily I hear about the struggles of people and you [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=330.28s)]
*  know, the issues they are going through and it ignites a fire in me to stand up. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=336.84000000000003s)]
*  There's something in my belly for my country that I cannot shake. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=341.32s)]
*  And even despite maybe the worrisome of my mother and people in my life, why, why, let's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=345.2s)]
*  go away. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=352.24s)]
*  Let's sail on the yacht. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=353.24s)]
*  Let's fucking do something. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=354.24s)]
*  Excuse the language. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=355.24s)]
*  Let's do something else. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=356.24s)]
*  I cannot. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=357.24s)]
*  My country is my country and I'll fight for it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=358.68s)]
*  So the day I go out and that is it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=362.0s)]
*  What was it like growing up here? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=365.4s)]
*  Where did you grow up? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=367.0s)]
*  What were the circumstances? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=368.0s)]
*  What was Ireland like as you were growing up? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=369.0s)]
*  Ireland is a beautiful place, beautiful place to grow up. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=370.0s)]
*  Very, very community driven and family driven. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=372.44s)]
*  And I grew up in a Dublin suburb off the city centre called Crumlin. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=376.0s)]
*  Dublin 12 is the district. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=380.0s)]
*  That's why I named my whiskey proper number 12 after my district. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=381.4s)]
*  It's where my public house is that we will go after in Dublin 12, the Black Forge Inn. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=385.4s)]
*  It's also home to the largest children's hospital in the country. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  So most people in Ireland have a relationship with the area. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=393.48s)]
*  It's a rough and tough area also. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=396.88s)]
*  Was it growing up rough? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=399.6s)]
*  For sure it was. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=401.12s)]
*  For sure it was. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=402.12s)]
*  You know, we moved out when I was about 17 years of age and that kind of got me a little [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=403.12s)]
*  break from it, if you will. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=406.5s)]
*  But I was 17 years of age. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=408.08s)]
*  I had already made my friends. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=409.96s)]
*  I was like an alien in the new place. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=411.64s)]
*  So I always made my way back down. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=413.76s)]
*  My boxing club was down there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=415.64s)]
*  My football club was down there. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=417.28s)]
*  All my friends were down there. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=419.06s)]
*  Although I moved out at 17, I never really moved out. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, so. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=423.47999999999996s)]
*  But Ireland's a great place, full of great people. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=424.47999999999996s)]
*  But it wasn't a rich neighbourhood you grew up in? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  It was not, no. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  For sure not. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  So you're 17. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  How far did you get in school? [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=436.47999999999996s)]
*  I went all the way to my leaving certs. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=439.47999999999996s)]
*  I was the only one in my family to do it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=442.47999999999996s)]
*  So I hold that up. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  I hold that. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=445.47999999999996s)]
*  At what age did you leave? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  18? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=447.47999999999996s)]
*  18 years of age. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=448.47999999999996s)]
*  At what age did you go to college? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=449.5s)]
*  I went into an apprenticeship. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=450.5s)]
*  It's either you get a job, you go to college, or you get an apprenticeship. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=451.5s)]
*  And I got an apprenticeship as a plumber on an industrial site in Kilternan County, Wicklow, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=455.5s)]
*  which was actually at the time one of the, actually it was the largest building site [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=462.5s)]
*  in Europe at the time. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=468.5s)]
*  And lo and behold, misspending, overspending, overbudget, all the rest of it, you know, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=470.5s)]
*  backhander central, the thing fell apart. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=477.52s)]
*  The ass fell out of it, we'll say. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=480.52s)]
*  And that is one of my issues here in Ireland and the people of Ireland, the overspending [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=482.52s)]
*  that's going on. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=486.52s)]
*  This is our public wealth being administered into private hands, enriching people to bring [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=487.52s)]
*  in this influx of illegal mass migration that is changing the fabric of my country. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=494.52s)]
*  It is, Ireland is very close to losing its Irishness. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=499.52s)]
*  And we will not let that happen, you know, and that's it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=505.53999999999996s)]
*  We must continue to raise our voice and speak our piece. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  It's almost taboo to speak it, and it has been made that way by our government elite. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=513.54s)]
*  Like I said, they use bullying, they use intimidation tactics, they use our funds to pay our legacy [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=520.54s)]
*  media to push an agenda. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=527.54s)]
*  They do not push facts, they push agendas. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=529.54s)]
*  And... [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=532.56s)]
*  I mean, I've only been here two days, but I'm a little bit confused by it, because Ireland [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=534.56s)]
*  is not like the United States in that you have an indigenous population of Celtic people [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=538.56s)]
*  called the Irish who've been here since the beginning of known history. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=542.56s)]
*  And so it's not like you were invaders, you were also never a colonial power, you never [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=546.56s)]
*  invaded anybody else. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=550.56s)]
*  You didn't have overseas colonies, you just kind of stayed on your island and brewed alcoholic [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=552.56s)]
*  beverages and... [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=557.56s)]
*  The best brewery in the land, not to me. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=559.5799999999999s)]
*  You never bothered anybody, you don't have any national crimes to atone for. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  So I come here to Dublin, your biggest city, and not one advertisement on any public space [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  has Irish people in it. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=574.5799999999999s)]
*  And it's clearly part of the same propaganda campaign, like make white people hate themselves, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=576.5799999999999s)]
*  make white people feel ashamed to be white, white people are criminals. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=581.5799999999999s)]
*  It's like, okay, but why would they... [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=585.6s)]
*  Who's doing that to you and why? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=588.6s)]
*  What is that? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=590.6s)]
*  I feel since the turn of the crash, our government elite have been accosted into full-time globalist [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=591.6s)]
*  traitors of Ireland. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=597.6s)]
*  And they take their orders from above. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=599.6s)]
*  And it's not even them. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=603.6s)]
*  They are being ordered, and the orders are coming down onto the people, and the people [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=605.6s)]
*  have no say. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=608.6s)]
*  We need amendments to the constitution, we need to remove this tight grip that the political [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=609.6s)]
*  elite have over the public. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=614.62s)]
*  And that is it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=616.62s)]
*  And that is our goal here eventually. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=617.62s)]
*  I operate my businesses and my entire life on fairness. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=620.62s)]
*  That is it. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=624.62s)]
*  What is fair? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=625.62s)]
*  What is correct? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=626.62s)]
*  Our government elite do the absolute opposite. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=628.62s)]
*  And it has to change. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=631.62s)]
*  It has got to change. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=633.62s)]
*  Our culture is being erased. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=634.62s)]
*  And you have a very distinct thousand-year-old or older culture that's based on Irishness. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=636.62s)]
*  The indigenous population of the island that we are on right now. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=643.64s)]
*  And they are being replaced at super high speed. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=647.64s)]
*  So you have said immigration is treason, mass migration is treason. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=651.64s)]
*  Describe the scale of it to Ireland and its effects. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=655.64s)]
*  Well, in the olden days, my family, the McGregor clan, you know, treason is, you are hung, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=659.64s)]
*  drawn and quartered if you commit treason against your nation. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=666.64s)]
*  So, you know, what is going on here is an abomination, a travesty. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=669.66s)]
*  And it cannot continue for much longer. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=674.66s)]
*  As you said, we are an island unto ourselves, a small island. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=677.66s)]
*  And we are being governed by a small people who are in turn being governed by another [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=681.66s)]
*  minute group of people. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=687.66s)]
*  And it must stop. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=689.66s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=690.66s)]
*  There is so much worry in this government elite circle about myself running for president. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=691.66s)]
*  And if we are a true democratic nation, which we are not, and I don't believe so, and it's [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=697.68s)]
*  becoming more and more clear and more evident, and the more Irish people are being awakened [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=701.68s)]
*  to this fact. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=705.68s)]
*  But if we are, let the people decide. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=707.68s)]
*  You know, it is this cozy clique where you have to almost bend the knee, you know, to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=710.68s)]
*  even have a shot at this. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=717.68s)]
*  We should be on the ticket. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=722.68s)]
*  And a citizen of Ireland should be allowed to be on the ticket above a certain age, of [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=723.6999999999999s)]
*  a certain grade, and let the people decide. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  A ticket to run for president. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=730.6999999999999s)]
*  A ticket to run for president. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=731.6999999999999s)]
*  That is it. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=733.6999999999999s)]
*  I do not even. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, wait, hold on. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=735.6999999999999s)]
*  This is a democracy, supposedly. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=736.6999999999999s)]
*  Why can't you run for president? [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=737.6999999999999s)]
*  Because there's stipulations. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=738.6999999999999s)]
*  You have to get four county councils which are controlled by the government parties. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=740.6999999999999s)]
*  Or you have to get 20 nominations of the arractus, which are all mostly party affiliates. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=744.6999999999999s)]
*  So you can't just run for president. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=749.6999999999999s)]
*  You can't just run for president. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=751.6999999999999s)]
*  So how is it a democracy? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=752.72s)]
*  Yeah, there you go. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=753.72s)]
*  How is it? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=754.72s)]
*  It isn't. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=755.72s)]
*  Oh. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=756.72s)]
*  Are you going to do it anyway? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=757.72s)]
*  I'm going to push forward and carry on my journey, highlighting my country's plight, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=758.72s)]
*  my country's fight, and also my country's delight. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=767.72s)]
*  You know, I do not want to be doom and gloom here, as I said. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=770.72s)]
*  Dublin is the greatest city on earth, and Ireland is the greatest country on earth. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=774.72s)]
*  And I know as an American man, you're probably sitting there in your chair, but we're going [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=778.72s)]
*  in your chair, but we love Ireland dearly, our people. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=781.74s)]
*  No, I'm not actually. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=783.74s)]
*  I'm just the opposite. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=784.74s)]
*  I'm thinking you've got a claim on being the greatest country. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=786.74s)]
*  You've got a claim, for sure. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=788.74s)]
*  You do. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=789.74s)]
*  And it's worth fighting for. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=790.74s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=791.74s)]
*  That's what I'm here for. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=792.74s)]
*  So why wouldn't people, I know the media here hates you, but I've never understood why. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=793.74s)]
*  I mean, you're not calling for invading anybody or throwing anyone in prison, maybe other [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=797.74s)]
*  than your corrupt leadership. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=802.74s)]
*  You sound like they deserve it. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=803.74s)]
*  Why would they hate you? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=805.74s)]
*  I'm just calling for national safety. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=806.76s)]
*  Right now, our national security is at risk. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=811.76s)]
*  And that is a fact. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=814.76s)]
*  We are being overrun. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=815.76s)]
*  And it's a danger to the public. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=817.76s)]
*  And on top of that is our overspending of our public wealth. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=819.76s)]
*  It is preposterous, the splashing of our money on issues that have, one, not got to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=823.76s)]
*  do with us, and two, that actually directly put us in danger. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=829.76s)]
*  And these are my issues that I wish, we'll say, won on our campaign. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=833.78s)]
*  You ask about my political aspirations, I am of the belief that the era of the politician [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=838.78s)]
*  must end. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=844.78s)]
*  It must come to an end. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=845.78s)]
*  It has proven unfruitful. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=847.78s)]
*  And that is clear as day by the statistics and by what we see around us. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=850.78s)]
*  It is straight chancery. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=855.78s)]
*  Our ministers and our appointed ministers have no history in the roles that they are [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=857.8s)]
*  appointed to. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=864.8s)]
*  Our minister of finance has no history in accounting. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=865.8s)]
*  Our minister of health has no history in the health industry. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=868.8s)]
*  Our minister of education was never a school teacher. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=871.8s)]
*  As an example, as an example, as an example. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=874.8s)]
*  It is straight chancery we are dealing with. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=876.8s)]
*  The era of the politician must end, Tucker. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=878.8s)]
*  And I can see with the selections of the Trump administration that we look upon, [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=880.8s)]
*  which has been 24-7 work rate from my vantage point, Trump a businessman. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=886.8199999999999s)]
*  He's running it more like a business and with common sense. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=896.8199999999999s)]
*  That is where I would see it more so than these politicians where they're all in this [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=900.8199999999999s)]
*  clique and it's a party. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=905.8199999999999s)]
*  They are working on behalf of the party and not the people. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=907.8199999999999s)]
*  They are working to create a favour within the party to rise up the ranks. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=911.8199999999999s)]
*  And then the heads of the party are working to create a favour on the people above them [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=914.84s)]
*  again to rise up another rank. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=919.84s)]
*  It just serves the country. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=921.84s)]
*  It does not serve the country. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=924.84s)]
*  And that is it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=926.84s)]
*  I'm simply highlighting it, putting it out to the people. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=927.84s)]
*  If they wish for me to run, whatever my nation wants, I'm here for. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=930.84s)]
*  That's it. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=937.84s)]
*  CNN has described you as the leader, and I'm quoting, of Ireland's far right. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=938.84s)]
*  Who has? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=943.86s)]
*  CNN, which is a news channel in the United States. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=944.86s)]
*  Far left, far right, all of these terminologies mean nothing to me. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=949.86s)]
*  I'm a family man. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=953.86s)]
*  I'm an employer of the country. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=954.86s)]
*  I'm a supporter of many people. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=957.86s)]
*  And I care about my land and the safety of its citizens and the prosperity of its citizens. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=959.86s)]
*  I want preference. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=965.86s)]
*  I want peace, preference and prosperity for the citizens of Ireland, for my people. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=967.86s)]
*  And isn't that fair for our country, men and women? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=972.88s)]
*  It is our country. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=975.88s)]
*  Ireland is for Ireland. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=977.88s)]
*  You know? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=978.88s)]
*  And that is it. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=979.88s)]
*  I'm not right, left. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=980.88s)]
*  I feel I'm centred, grounded. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=982.88s)]
*  That is what I feel. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=986.88s)]
*  In fact, I ground myself every day. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=987.88s)]
*  I walk out and I ground myself every day, barefoot in the grass. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=989.88s)]
*  Barefoot is king. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=993.88s)]
*  I fought in the octagons, in the cages all around the countries of Ireland and then into [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=994.88s)]
*  the United States of America. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=999.88s)]
*  Barefoot. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1000.88s)]
*  So I am a grounded man. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1001.9s)]
*  Left, right. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1003.9s)]
*  I am center and grounded. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1004.9s)]
*  America has thousands of colleges and universities and a lot of them unfortunately are basically [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1007.9s)]
*  just scams. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1010.9s)]
*  It's one of those things nobody really wants to talk about, but everybody on some level [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1011.9s)]
*  knows that it's true. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1014.9s)]
*  What's an impressive college in 2025? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1015.9s)]
*  There aren't many at all. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1018.9s)]
*  Hillsdale is one of them. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1020.9s)]
*  It is the exception. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1021.9s)]
*  They cut straight through the woke garbage. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1022.9s)]
*  They give their students a real education, an actual education. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1024.9s)]
*  Meet a Hillsdale student and ask yourself, is this the best-educated 22-year-old I've [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1028.92s)]
*  met in a long time? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1032.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1033.92s)]
*  Because they don't have propaganda in their education. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1034.92s)]
*  Just the truth, facts, history, English, math. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1035.92s)]
*  If you think it sounds good, because it is good, think of this. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1039.92s)]
*  Hillsdale is offering over 40 free online courses you could enroll in today. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1042.92s)]

*  Free. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1060.94s)]
*  They have a new class called Understanding Capitalism that teaches Americans basic economic [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1061.94s)]
*  ideas, describes our own system, a system that is falling apart. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1067.94s)]

*  You'll understand the basis of our economy from founding till president. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1077.94s)]
*  Hillsdale, not afraid to preach the message our country has forgotten, which is freedom [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1082.96s)]
*  is good, Christianity is good, markets are good, and they make this country better by [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1087.96s)]
*  raising well-educated students. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1093.96s)]
*  We endorse this as a college hater. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1096.96s)]

*  So in the conversations I've had with people in Dublin, every single person I've talked [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1111.98s)]
*  to has said the same thing, which is Irish people can no longer afford houses, their [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1116.98s)]
*  kids can't afford to get married, and their kids can't afford to have kids, and they can't [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1121.98s)]
*  afford to have kids. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1125.98s)]
*  The Irish family of 12 children doesn't exist anymore, in part because no one can afford [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1126.98s)]
*  that, and yet your government is subsidizing immigrants to have kids. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1130.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1135.98s)]
*  And that's true in my country too, in Australia and New Zealand, and in the United States, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1136.98s)]
*  and in Australia and New Zealand and Canada and the UK. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1141.0s)]
*  What is that? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1143.0s)]
*  Suicide is what it is. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1144.0s)]
*  It's absolute suicide. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1146.0s)]
*  And you know, it has to stop. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1148.0s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1152.0s)]
*  The rising cost of living is a national emergency. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1153.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1157.0s)]
*  And you know, it has to stop. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1158.0s)]
*  We say no. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1161.0s)]
*  We built a toll bridge here in Ireland. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1163.0s)]
*  We built toll bridges to solve the foreign companies. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1165.0s)]
*  And billions of this goes to foreign companies. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1168.02s)]
*  It's silly. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1170.02s)]
*  It's illogical. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1171.02s)]
*  So the people of Ireland build something, and then your government sells it to foreigners, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1172.02s)]
*  and then you have to pay for it? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1176.02s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1177.02s)]
*  And it's billions per annum. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1178.02s)]
*  Billions in profit per annum. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1179.02s)]
*  And people, another thing, the traffic car on Garda Shia Con is one of the most successful [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1180.02s)]
*  divisions in the police force, in our police force, for convictions, and you know, it is [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1187.02s)]
*  the most successful. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1195.02s)]
*  And it has caused untold stress unto the people of Ireland. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1196.04s)]
*  I wonder the amount of suicides, the amount of lives lost, and families destroyed over [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1199.04s)]
*  the stress of the traffic car institution, where you get caught driving without tax, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1204.04s)]
*  or you know, no NCT, or it's all a money racket. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1212.04s)]
*  So just for foreigners watching this, you're talking about parking and minor traffic violations. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1215.04s)]
*  Yeah, put through the wringer. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1220.04s)]
*  And now in this day and age, which is why it's so infuriating, and then, you know, we'll [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1222.06s)]
*  keep calm with it, but it's why people in Ireland are waking up, because everyone has [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1227.06s)]
*  felt it in some way, shape, or form, the stress of having to make sure that you're above board [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1231.06s)]
*  on this money racket is what it is. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1237.06s)]
*  So it's not to keep you safe, it's to steal money from you. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1239.06s)]
*  Not to keep you safe, but on this day and age now, we've got our new visitors to the [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1242.06s)]
*  island who get fully exempt from driving without tax, insurance, NCT, and even on Irish regsplates, [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1247.08s)]
*  free as a bird, right through after our nation has gone through the most stressful periods [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1254.08s)]
*  of our life. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1260.08s)]
*  Lives have been lost due to the stress caused of this branch in Ungardersliy Y'Kona. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1261.08s)]
*  And yet now people, now our neighbours from other countries are moving here, and with [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1267.08s)]
*  full exemption, to drive around our roads with supercharged vehicles that have been [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1274.1s)]
*  imported on the taxpayers' dime. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1280.1s)]
*  And then also even another crazy statement is if something happens to your vehicle, if [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1282.1s)]
*  you're a nice friendly visitor or potential new member of our country, you get your vehicle [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1290.1s)]
*  repaired at a cost to the state. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1296.1s)]
*  So it is just ludicrous, and the people of Ireland are rising up to it. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1299.1s)]
*  We're just being awakened to it, and that's it. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1302.12s)]
*  As we awaken, you know, we're noticing... [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1305.12s)]
*  Is what you said real? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1308.12s)]
*  That's very, very real. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1309.12s)]
*  Very, very real. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1310.12s)]
*  How can they justify you? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1311.12s)]
*  They cannot. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1312.12s)]
*  There is no justification. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1313.12s)]
*  You know what there is? [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1314.12s)]
*  Silence. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1315.12s)]
*  And that is... [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1316.12s)]
*  That doesn't work. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1317.12s)]
*  You cannot be silent on this. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1318.12s)]
*  Like I said, you're not going to get off ruining Ireland or ripping off Ireland. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1319.12s)]
*  Never in a million years. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1322.12s)]
*  But if they're paying foreigners to have kids, well, you can't afford to have kids. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1323.12s)]
*  If they're shaking you down with the armed forces, you can't afford to have kids. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1326.12s)]
*  If they're shaking you down with the armed police, but allowing foreigners a pass, if [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1330.1399999999999s)]
*  they're paying to fix foreigners' cars but not yours, they hate you and they're trying [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1336.1399999999999s)]
*  to kill you, right? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1341.1399999999999s)]
*  It's an attempt at erasure of our people. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1342.1399999999999s)]
*  That is it. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1345.1399999999999s)]
*  I could have went all that way in the White House. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1346.1399999999999s)]
*  I had to climb... [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1350.1399999999999s)]
*  You go incrementally up, right? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1351.1399999999999s)]
*  You go in, hey, you talk about a genocide. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1354.1399999999999s)]
*  This is the genocide of our people. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1356.1399999999999s)]
*  Obviously. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1358.1399999999999s)]
*  But you know, you got to climb it right. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1359.16s)]
*  So we're getting there and awareness is being made and we'll make the moves. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1361.16s)]
*  And there's many great people. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1366.16s)]
*  In fact, the majority of the Irish people are great people. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1367.16s)]
*  Majority, majority are great people doing great things for our nation. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1371.16s)]
*  And the pressure and the awareness we're putting on our government elite is causing slight [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1376.16s)]
*  changes. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1382.16s)]
*  You know, they're doing certain things to appease. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1383.16s)]
*  However, how genuine that is, how much of a facade that is, we're skeptical. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1387.18s)]
*  Our trust is at an all-time low. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1393.18s)]
*  And you know, you see we walk the length and breadth of the Dublin city capital and it's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1395.18s)]
*  love and cheer and support. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1402.18s)]
*  Not one politician under any party can do the same. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1405.18s)]
*  And that is a shame. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1409.18s)]
*  Actually, I don't understand why they... [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1411.2s)]
*  Ireland, we are the greatest supporters. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1416.2s)]
*  You do good by Ireland, Ireland will do good by you. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1417.2s)]
*  And none more is that evident in myself. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1420.2s)]
*  We are the greatest supporters in the world, they say. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1423.2s)]
*  How our politicians do not wish to receive this love. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1426.2s)]
*  I do not understand it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1430.2s)]
*  Fundraising efforts will begin and there will be a large fund built into this where we're [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1432.2s)]
*  going to really take back our country. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1436.2s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1439.2s)]
*  Funds are needed, money is needed. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1440.22s)]
*  Is anybody... [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1442.22s)]
*  So you've made a, I think... [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1443.22s)]
*  If I think about these tariffs, what's going on right now, well, their money dries up and [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1444.22s)]
*  they're panicking about their money, our government elite, our money rises up. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1448.22s)]
*  And that is an exciting thing for the people of Ireland to hear. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1452.22s)]
*  And that's what this is. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1455.22s)]
*  My funds are infinite and I'm all in for the country of Ireland and I've got incredible [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1456.22s)]
*  backing from your country and other countries that wish to support our cause. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1461.22s)]
*  And I said it's a real movement for change. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1465.22s)]
*  So let me ask you, so a lot of political movement or one political movement in particular in [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1467.24s)]
*  Ireland had support from rich Irish Americans for years. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1473.24s)]
*  The Republicans, the nationalists here had support from donors in the United States. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1477.24s)]
*  Do you think Irish Americans in the U.S., a lot of whom are rich, understand what's [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1481.24s)]
*  happening in this country? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1486.24s)]
*  No, no, for sure. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1487.24s)]
*  And when I seen Micheál Mártoná Tísok, our rotating Tísok, grace the Oval Office [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1488.24s)]
*  on March 12th, five days before St. Patrick's Day, five days before myself, I saw softball. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1494.26s)]
*  I saw a game of softball by Vice President Vance and President Trump and almost a little [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1503.26s)]
*  bit of pandering to him, being safe with him because you cannot be seen, that's 40 million [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1509.26s)]
*  Irish Americans and that vote is very strong for the administration. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1515.26s)]
*  You know, you need that on strong. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1520.26s)]
*  You need that on side. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1521.26s)]
*  You need that on side. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1522.28s)]
*  So they couldn't be seen, although their feelings are well known, you know, they're well against [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1523.28s)]
*  what's going on here in this country, they could not be seen to be tearing through an [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1528.28s)]
*  Irish delegate on the St. Patrick's week. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1532.28s)]
*  So they played it, they played it correct. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1534.28s)]
*  And then when I seen this, I said, okay, and I got my call to go and show up. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1536.28s)]
*  I said, I'm going to highlight this to the Irish American people. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1542.28s)]
*  This is what's really going on. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1545.28s)]
*  You know, some people are saying, hey, I'm from Wexford. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1547.28s)]
*  I'm from Wexford. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1550.3s)]
*  My grandmother's from Wexford. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1551.3s)]
*  I said Wexford was the sunny southeast is what we used to call Wexford. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1552.3s)]
*  Well, we do call it a holiday destination. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1556.3s)]
*  It is now no more. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1558.3s)]
*  There is no hotels available in Wexford. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1560.3s)]
*  They're all transferred into I-Pass centers, which are international protection applicant [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1562.3s)]
*  services. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1566.3s)]
*  It's this fuck, it's this racket where they're all getting housed. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1567.3s)]
*  It is an office block. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1571.3s)]
*  It is a hotel. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1573.3s)]
*  It is a, it is even a school. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1574.3s)]
*  It is even schools now are being transferred into these. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1576.3s)]
*  Filled with immigrants. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1579.32s)]
*  Filled with immigrants, yes. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1580.32s)]
*  So, so, so Wexford, Wexford Rosalier port is another port where they arrive in and they're [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1582.32s)]
*  in County Wexford, which used to be the sunny southeast, a beautiful holiday destination [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1589.32s)]
*  is now without a hotel in the county. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1593.32s)]
*  They've all been transferred into international protection. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1596.32s)]
*  Why doesn't someone overthrow the government? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1599.32s)]
*  Here? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1601.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1602.32s)]
*  I mean, that's like an act of war against your country. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1603.32s)]
*  I mean, I shouldn't say that to you because I don't want to get you in trouble. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1605.32s)]
*  But in a normal country, we move, we move, we move under God and we let God guide us. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1607.34s)]
*  We're capable of many things. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1617.34s)]
*  We're capable of many things as a great nation, as a great people. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1619.34s)]
*  And we move under God. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1622.34s)]
*  Well, you've heard a lot of complaining in the last couple of weeks since Donald Trump [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1624.34s)]
*  announced his new import tariffs on foreign made things. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1628.34s)]
*  A lot of people don't like it. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1631.34s)]
*  But the companies who make American products in America with American materials, they're [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1634.36s)]
*  pretty happy. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1639.36s)]
*  They're not affected by this. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1641.36s)]
*  They've been doing the right thing since the beginning. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1643.36s)]
*  They're not paying tariffs because again, they're making American products for Americans. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1646.36s)]
*  Liberty Safe is a perfect example. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1653.36s)]
*  Liberty Safe is not making its stuff in some foreign country. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1656.36s)]
*  It's not made in China or Vietnam or India. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1660.36s)]
*  It's made right here with American steel. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1662.3799999999999s)]
*  They employ skilled American craftsmen who do an amazing job. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  That's why they make the best safes there are. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1670.3799999999999s)]
*  They have the highest standard of quality and security. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1672.3799999999999s)]
*  So you don't have to worry that when you lock up things that you really care about, they're [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1674.3799999999999s)]
*  going to get stolen. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1678.3799999999999s)]
*  They're not. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1679.3799999999999s)]
*  These are safes you can trust. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1680.3799999999999s)]
*  I keep my father's shotguns in a Liberty Safe at my house. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1682.3799999999999s)]
*  When you buy Liberty, you support American jobs. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1685.3799999999999s)]

*  He said the prisons. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1735.42s)]
*  He said the prisons for us. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1736.42s)]
*  And I just thought, okay. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1737.42s)]
*  And then I thought about our prisons. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1739.42s)]
*  Our prisons are overrun right now. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1741.42s)]
*  We've got maybe just thousands of people without a bed even in the prison. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1742.44s)]
*  Let alone we can't house our people. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1747.44s)]
*  We can't even have a bed for the prisoners. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1748.44s)]
*  So straight away you're going in there. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1750.44s)]
*  You came in, you committed a crime on our soil, you're gone. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1753.44s)]
*  That's it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1756.44s)]
*  No ifs, ands, or buts. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1757.44s)]
*  Why is the taxpayer paying to keep prisoners from foreign countries in our prisons? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1759.44s)]
*  And it's being overrun. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1765.44s)]
*  So I would be up for that. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1767.44s)]
*  I would be up for that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1769.46s)]

*  How did you enter our country? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1774.46s)]
*  Illegally? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1775.46s)]

*  If so, yes, Cade Milleforte, if not, gone. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1789.46s)]
*  And we can do that. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1792.46s)]
*  And then also a turning off of the tap. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1794.46s)]
*  Right now, as I said, about the car situation, they arrive, you get favor if you're from [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1796.48s)]
*  another nation. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1802.48s)]
*  But if you're from... [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1803.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1804.48s)]
*  Who thought of this? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1805.48s)]
*  It's an order from above. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1807.48s)]
*  It's a globalist agenda. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1809.48s)]
*  That's the truth of it. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1810.48s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1811.48s)]
*  So for me, if I get in, I'm going to be exerting my influence to turn off the tap. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1813.48s)]
*  If you think about what Trump has done, they're actually stopping coming in. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1818.48s)]
*  Because it's not there no more. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1823.48s)]
*  The gravy train isn't there no more. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1824.5s)]
*  What is there is actually resistance. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1826.5s)]
*  You know? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1829.5s)]
*  And that's where it's at. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1830.5s)]
*  Now, there is a human... [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1831.5s)]
*  There's compassion for me. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1832.5s)]
*  There's compassion. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1834.5s)]
*  I employ people from all walks of life. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1835.5s)]
*  So there is a compassion element. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1837.5s)]
*  Many people have emigrated here, have done great things for our country. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1839.5s)]
*  And that has to be highlighted also. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1843.5s)]
*  But it's like at a stage now where the great people who have come here and emigrated and [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1845.5s)]
*  contributed greatly to our society are now feeling the strain of... [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1849.52s)]
*  And are feeling the wrath almost because of this social unrest. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1854.52s)]
*  It has to stop. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1858.52s)]
*  It has got to stop. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1859.52s)]
*  And we're at our limit with it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1861.52s)]
*  We are really at our limit with it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1863.52s)]
*  How the next few years go... [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1865.52s)]
*  It's worrisome. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1869.52s)]
*  It is worrisome. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1870.52s)]
*  This EU pact, this EU migration pact that as a president I could get in and I could really [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1871.52s)]
*  rattle it and put it to a stop, push to stop it, which would be the main thing. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1875.54s)]
*  They're trying to now hurry it through, which if it goes through, it's like 30,000, 40,000, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1881.54s)]
*  50,000. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1887.54s)]
*  It's an unlimited number that we'll have to take. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1888.54s)]
*  It's on the orders of... [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1890.54s)]
*  And move all around your country, right? [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1892.54s)]
*  Into small towns. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1894.54s)]
*  This is what they've done in the United States. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1895.54s)]
*  They move them into small towns around the country. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1897.54s)]
*  So then your country's gone and you don't even know it. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1899.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1901.54s)]
*  Are they doing that here? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1902.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1903.54s)]
*  There's counties all around right now. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1904.56s)]
*  There's a county in Ireland, a Gailtox county, it's a Gailtox town. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1906.56s)]
*  And there's more iPads... [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1910.56s)]
*  It was a home for the Ukrainians and now it's being altered into an iPads centre. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1912.56s)]
*  And it's one of the last places of our language. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1916.56s)]
*  And that is being... [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1919.56s)]
*  That is feeling an influx of it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1920.56s)]
*  And the people are out in the streets against it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1922.56s)]
*  So it is happening in counties all over Ireland for sure. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1925.56s)]
*  And with this EU migration pact, if the floodgates are open on that, it's... [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1928.56s)]
*  It's a difficult time. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1934.58s)]
*  It's changing the religious composition of your country, which since St. Patrick has been a Catholic country, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1935.58s)]
*  you had Anglican overlords from across the water, but it's been a Catholic country for over a thousand years. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1941.58s)]
*  So now they're trying to put a refugee centre in a... [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1948.58s)]
*  Well, you had a Christian holy site town in Ireland, I was reading this. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1952.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1956.58s)]
*  It's hard to think that's not on purpose. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1957.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1959.58s)]
*  Yeah, it is purposeful for sure. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1960.62s)]
*  Is anyone saying anything about this? [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1963.62s)]
*  Like in your media? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1965.62s)]
*  Nah, you know, I wonder. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1966.62s)]
*  I do often wonder. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1968.62s)]
*  And I'm almost certain they must be behind doors. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1970.62s)]
*  You know, it's like if your boss says something and you don't agree, but you're going to... [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1974.62s)]
*  You might have to agree because your livelihood is on the line, which is essentially what it is. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1983.62s)]
*  A lot of people's livelihoods are on the line. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1988.6599999999999s)]
*  In fact, the only people that agree with it are in public, because I actually... [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1990.6599999999999s)]
*  I could not believe that they could believe it behind closed doors. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=1997.6599999999999s)]
*  Boss are not. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2000.6599999999999s)]
*  Livelihood are not. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm almost certain they could not believe in this way for our country. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2003.6599999999999s)]
*  But that's it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2008.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm just, you know... [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2011.6599999999999s)]
*  So your biggest media company is state media. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2012.6599999999999s)]
*  It's like North Korean state media. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2016.7s)]
*  It's called RTE. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2017.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2018.7s)]
*  And it literally is an organ of the state, which is amazing. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2019.7s)]
*  But then you have social media, and you tweeted on social media, Ireland, we're at war. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2022.7s)]
*  You obviously are. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2028.7s)]
*  What was the reaction from the government to that tweet? [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2029.7s)]
*  Opera. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2032.7s)]
*  You know, I was the scapegoat. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2034.7s)]
*  And then an incident happened where an Algerian visitor or citizen had an Irish passport. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2036.7s)]
*  And so we believe that the information is not fully revealed. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2042.74s)]
*  You could never get a straight answer from these people. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2049.7400000000002s)]
*  Never get a straight answer. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2051.7400000000002s)]
*  Our children were stabbed inside of an Irish school on Parnell Street. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2052.7400000000002s)]
*  And a teacher was stabbed trying to fight them off. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2057.7400000000002s)]
*  And then an Irish man jumped in. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2060.7400000000002s)]
*  And then an immigrant from Brazil jumped in. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2061.7400000000002s)]
*  And together they wrestled them down. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2063.7400000000002s)]
*  And then it was, you know, hide it and blame my tweets as the reason it kicked off. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2065.7400000000002s)]
*  That's kind of what we're dealing with. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2071.7799999999997s)]
*  Wait, an Algerian stabbed Irish children, but it was your fault? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2072.7799999999997s)]
*  Pretty much. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2075.7799999999997s)]
*  Pretty much was kind of what the rhetoric was, yes. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2076.7799999999997s)]
*  And then, you know, that was it, yeah, pretty much. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2078.7799999999997s)]
*  Like I said, I often wonder about, if I think about, you know, did they believe in this? [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2081.7799999999997s)]
*  We've 6,000 members of the Defence Force, 6,000 Army. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2086.7799999999997s)]
*  And we have about 12,000 Gardaí. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2090.7799999999997s)]
*  I really wonder how many are happy with the direction our country was going. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2092.7799999999997s)]
*  I cannot see, I cannot see many behind closed doors. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2097.82s)]
*  Gardaí or the police? [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2102.82s)]
*  Gardaí or the police. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2103.82s)]
*  I cannot see many closed doors that are happy with this. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2104.82s)]
*  Even if I look at what has happened in some of the protests where the Gardaí are, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2106.82s)]
*  essentially the Gardaí are following orders, they're doing their job. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2110.82s)]
*  It's a tricky one. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2113.82s)]
*  And it's a sad one to see. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2114.82s)]
*  It was very sad and upsetting to see our Gardaí turn on their compatriots. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2115.82s)]
*  And that's what we saw. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2119.82s)]
*  And use excessive force. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2120.82s)]
*  But it's an order coming down. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2122.82s)]
*  And I feel sad seeing it. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2124.86s)]
*  I feel sad seeing it. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2126.86s)]
*  And most recently one of them came out unnamed and said it has stayed with him. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2127.86s)]
*  They are very, very troubled by it. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2133.86s)]
*  And it's just a sad sight to see. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2136.86s)]
*  You know, Ireland, we should be together. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2139.86s)]
*  And that's what I said. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2141.86s)]
*  I wonder how many behind closed doors are really with this cause that we are fighting. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2142.86s)]
*  So if nothing... [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2148.86s)]
*  I would assume it's most, the majority. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2149.86s)]
*  I think that's true in the US too. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2151.86s)]
*  I think our FBI is totally corrupt as I'm sure you've read. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2153.9s)]
*  I think most FBI agents are probably appalled, but too afraid to do anything. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2156.9s)]
*  How long, if nothing changes, will Ireland remain Ireland, do you think? [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2161.9s)]
*  How much time do you have before it's just not victory? [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2165.9s)]
*  Well, we are a small island. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2170.9s)]
*  We are a small, small island. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2172.9s)]
*  And we are now... [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2174.9s)]
*  I don't even want to highlight. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2175.9s)]
*  I actually do... [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2177.9s)]
*  I'm actually at a stage now where I'm cautious of highlighting the fact that [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2178.9s)]
*  I'm not of highlighting the benefits of arriving here [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2182.94s)]
*  because it's only going to attract more. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2185.94s)]
*  You know, if I look at Trump's situation, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2187.94s)]
*  it has decreased the amount of people who are attempting to immigrate [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2190.94s)]
*  to the United States of America because of what's going on. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2193.94s)]
*  This is what I wish would have happened. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2196.94s)]
*  If you turn off the tap, they go, or they stop coming. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2198.94s)]
*  If you show a basket full of golden eggs, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2201.94s)]
*  they just arrive for it, you know, and that's kind of what it is. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2205.94s)]
*  So... [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2208.94s)]
*  It's awful here, I just want to say that. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2209.94s)]
*  It's a free-for-all with our public wealth, with our money. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2211.98s)]
*  A free-for-all. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2214.98s)]
*  And it's been stolen. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2216.98s)]
*  And it has to stop. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2218.98s)]
*  It's not... [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2220.98s)]
*  How long? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2221.98s)]
*  I couldn't give you the exact figures, you know. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2223.98s)]
*  Statistics... [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2225.98s)]
*  It doesn't look right. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2227.98s)]
*  It could happen. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2229.98s)]
*  Not long. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2230.98s)]
*  Anyway, not long. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2231.98s)]
*  It feels that way. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2232.98s)]
*  So how did you... [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2233.98s)]
*  Just back to my original question. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2234.98s)]
*  You're a plumber's apprentice on an industrial site [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2236.98s)]
*  in Ireland, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2241.02s)]
*  cutting cast iron pipes and replacing them [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2242.02s)]
*  or whatever you're doing, probably something like that. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2245.02s)]
*  And then you wind up here, [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2247.02s)]
*  thinking about running for president [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2249.02s)]
*  with these very evolved political views. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2251.02s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2253.02s)]
*  Having a love for one's country. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2257.02s)]
*  That's it, I have a love for my country. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2259.02s)]
*  I fought to represent my nation's flag [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2261.02s)]
*  on the grandest stage of fighting. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2263.02s)]
*  That was my aspiration, to represent my nation. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2265.02s)]
*  To open the doors of the fighting world [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2268.06s)]
*  and the martial arts world to the Irish public. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2271.06s)]
*  And to support my teammates. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2274.06s)]
*  We were all... [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2276.06s)]
*  We had a kindred spirit rising up, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2278.06s)]
*  chasing our dreams, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2281.06s)]
*  and a very tight-knit crew. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2283.06s)]
*  And we rose up. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2286.06s)]
*  And I got in there. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2287.06s)]
*  I was successful. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2288.06s)]
*  I opened it up. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2290.06s)]
*  Now, the martial arts lifestyle is a real way of living [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2291.06s)]
*  for many people in Ireland. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2294.06s)]
*  And I take great happiness in seeing that. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2295.06s)]
*  And I suppose it's just a continue off of that. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2297.1s)]
*  You know, it's a different fight now. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2301.1s)]
*  You know, it's a different fight. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2303.1s)]
*  But it's still a fight to represent my country [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2305.1s)]
*  to the best of my ability. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2308.1s)]
*  Well, Easter is finally here, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2310.1s)]
*  and there's no better way to remember the story of Christ. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2312.1s)]
*  Jesus dying for your sins is the most powerful thing [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2314.1s)]
*  that has ever happened in history. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2316.1s)]
*  It is really the beginning of history, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2318.1s)]
*  and it's worth celebrating. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2320.1s)]
*  This Easter, embrace the freedom of the resurrection [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2322.1s)]
*  on Hallow, which is the number one prayer app [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2324.1s)]
*  in the world. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2326.14s)]
*  Join Liz Tabish, who plays Mary Magdalene in The Chosen, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2327.14s)]
*  actor Kevin James, and others, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2330.14s)]
*  in an immersive and jubilant prayer experience [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2332.14s)]
*  worthy of Easter itself. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2335.14s)]
*  Every single day, you learn how to walk in freedom [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2337.14s)]
*  amidst the circumstances, often crushing of your daily life, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2340.14s)]
*  and let go of the things that you're attached to [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2343.14s)]
*  and that are causing suffering, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2345.14s)]
*  and instead embrace the peace and freedom [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2347.14s)]
*  that come when you place your trust in God, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2350.14s)]
*  which is the only place to place your trust. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2352.14s)]
*  So enter the joy of Easter [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2355.18s)]
*  with a brief prayer reflection meditation every single day [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2356.18s)]
*  that will help you continue the habits [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2359.18s)]
*  that will change everything, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2362.18s)]
*  the ones you established during Lent. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2364.18s)]
*  We love Hallow here. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2366.18s)]
*  We love the app. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2367.18s)]
*  We know you will, too. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2368.18s)]
*  It's got thousands of prayers, meditations, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2369.18s)]
*  music to help you build a daily habit of prayer [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2371.18s)]
*  and to grow closer to God. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2373.18s)]
*  Download Hallow today at Hallow.com slash Tucker. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2375.18s)]
*  You get three months for free. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2378.18s)]
*  You'll be grateful. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2380.18s)]
*  You did. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2381.18s)]
*  Honestly, you will be. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2382.18s)]
*  So when you started fighting, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2383.22s)]
*  as you said, you're a plumber's apprentice [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2385.22s)]
*  on an industrial site, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2387.22s)]
*  and then you announce in public a few years after that, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2388.22s)]
*  you haven't heard of me, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2391.22s)]
*  but I'm going to be the world champion. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2392.22s)]
*  And then you were. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2394.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2395.22s)]
*  Five time. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2396.22s)]
*  Five time. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2397.22s)]
*  Did you know that you were going to be [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2399.22s)]
*  or were you trying to put your marker out [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2402.22s)]
*  and then live up to it? [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2405.22s)]
*  Well, that's what I will say here about, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2406.22s)]
*  you know, I do not wish to be doom and gloom. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2408.22s)]
*  My outlook on life has always been [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2411.2599999999998s)]
*  to have a positive outlook, you know, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2414.2599999999998s)]
*  borderline delusional. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2416.2599999999998s)]
*  I could walk into a burning house [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2418.2599999999998s)]
*  and see her birds chirping as an example. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2420.2599999999998s)]
*  And that assisted me in being able to [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2423.2599999999998s)]
*  block out certain things that may have impacted me [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2426.2599999999998s)]
*  and hampered me and slowed me down [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2429.2599999999998s)]
*  from getting to where I was going. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2432.2599999999998s)]
*  So I wish to continue with that [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2433.2599999999998s)]
*  and have a positive outlook and say [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2435.2599999999998s)]
*  it's not all doom and gloom. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2437.2599999999998s)]
*  It's not all doom and gloom. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2438.3s)]
*  Like I said, there are positive changes [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2439.3s)]
*  happening incrementally, slowly, but surely. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2441.3s)]
*  Slowly but surely. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2444.3s)]
*  And as I said, there's a great group of people [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2445.3s)]
*  and it's the majority of Irish people [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2448.3s)]
*  that are at the helm of it. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2450.3s)]
*  I am a voice and a support. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2452.3s)]
*  And as I said, I'm here to serve my country, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2455.3s)]
*  serve my country to the best of my ability [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2458.3s)]
*  and protect my country. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2460.3s)]
*  That is all I wish. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2461.3s)]
*  I wish for the people to have the power [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2463.34s)]
*  and myself to have a vote amongst the people. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2468.34s)]
*  That is my aim. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2472.34s)]
*  What did you think of President Trump? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2474.34s)]
*  What do I think of him? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2476.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2477.34s)]
*  I think he's doing very, very well. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2478.34s)]
*  I think, you know, I was present [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2479.34s)]
*  for his 2016 inauguration, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2481.34s)]
*  although not officially. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2484.34s)]
*  I was there on fighting business. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2486.34s)]
*  I was fighting in Madison Square Garden [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2487.34s)]
*  for my second UFC World Title. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2489.34s)]
*  And MMA and UFC had just became legalized [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2492.38s)]
*  in New York at the time. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2496.38s)]
*  And I remember Trump had been just voted in [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2497.38s)]
*  and he won the election [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2500.38s)]
*  and it was uproar on the streets and anger [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2501.38s)]
*  and, you know, fear, I suppose, was going on. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2503.38s)]
*  And at that time, I was just an observer. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2506.38s)]
*  You know, politics wasn't really on my mind [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2509.38s)]
*  at that time. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2511.38s)]
*  Ireland was not really going through [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2512.38s)]
*  what it was going through at that stage in 2016. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2513.38s)]
*  Although it was rising, it was unbeknownst to me [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2516.38s)]
*  and many in the country. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2519.38s)]
*  Were you not political, really? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2520.38s)]
*  Not really political now at that stage. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2521.42s)]
*  You know, I was focused on my craft [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2523.42s)]
*  and it wasn't at the forefront. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2524.42s)]
*  It all kind of took a turn post-COVID. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2526.42s)]
*  It all took a real turn post-COVID. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2528.42s)]
*  And you could kind of see what was going on [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2531.42s)]
*  and what had gone on post the crash, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2534.42s)]
*  you know, and who our government is serving. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2537.42s)]
*  You could kind of see that come to fruition then [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2541.42s)]
*  throughout the COVID era. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2543.42s)]
*  And then I just became more invested [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2545.42s)]
*  and then that was it. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2548.42s)]
*  But I was there for Trump's inauguration [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2549.46s)]
*  when he was sworn in for the first time. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2552.46s)]
*  Fear, worry, panic. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2554.46s)]
*  And then I was there the second time [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2556.46s)]
*  in 2024, most recent. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2558.46s)]
*  And it was elation and excitement. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2559.46s)]
*  And I thought it was good to see. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2561.46s)]
*  They asked me, what do I think he'll be as a president? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2563.46s)]
*  I said, well, when it was 2016 [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2566.46s)]
*  in the media runs I was doing. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2568.46s)]
*  And I said, let's see, you know, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2571.46s)]
*  give the man a chance. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2572.46s)]
*  He's not from a political background. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2574.46s)]
*  He's from a different background. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2577.5s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2578.5s)]
*  Let us see. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2579.5s)]
*  And I thought he'd done well. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2580.5s)]
*  You know, towards the end of the term, [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2581.5s)]
*  you know, there may have been times to, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2584.5s)]
*  you know, as a leader of a country, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2587.5s)]
*  you almost need to, you know, cool the flames. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2590.5s)]
*  You know, maybe there were some things [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2594.5s)]
*  that might have fanned the flames [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2596.5s)]
*  towards the end of his term that I thought. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2598.5s)]
*  But this time around, I feel that he's off to a good start. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2600.5s)]
*  And I wish him well. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2603.5s)]
*  I wish the country of him, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2604.5s)]
*  the United States of America well. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2605.54s)]
*  I consider them my dear siblings. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2608.54s)]
*  We consider America our sibling. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2611.54s)]
*  And I think it's going well. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2613.54s)]
*  And we're getting a good fair bit of energy from Ireland, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2615.54s)]
*  even amidst the tariff situation that is going on. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2619.54s)]
*  You know, Ireland's people have not seen [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2623.54s)]
*  the money got to do with this at whatever. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2627.54s)]
*  In fact, we have been, you know, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2631.54s)]
*  robbed of our own money. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2633.58s)]
*  And yet, we are supposed to be this wealthy country. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2635.58s)]
*  Yet the people of Ireland are struggling to heat their homes. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2639.58s)]
*  So there are many people who are seeing this tariff situation [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2642.58s)]
*  as a, you know, a gotcha moment for our government. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2646.58s)]
*  I'm not so much of that. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2649.58s)]
*  I wish for our country to be prosperous [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2650.58s)]
*  and our people to be prosperous. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2654.58s)]
*  And that's what my aim is. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2656.58s)]
*  That's what my wish is and my hope is. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2658.58s)]
*  So you're not necessarily against the tariffs, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2660.62s)]
*  it doesn't sound like. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2662.62s)]
*  Well, our government say, what good is tariffs? [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2663.62s)]
*  Tariffs are no good for nobody. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2668.62s)]
*  Yet they've been tariffing the United States. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2670.62s)]
*  You know, if that's the case, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2672.62s)]
*  then why have we been tariffing them? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2674.62s)]
*  Why have we been hitting them with tariffs? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2676.62s)]
*  I'm not so much against it. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2678.62s)]
*  I'm watching it. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2680.62s)]
*  You know, I'm watching it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2681.62s)]
*  I wish for economic success for my nation. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2683.62s)]
*  And, you know, I'm not against it. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2686.62s)]
*  You know, Ireland deserves it. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2689.66s)]
*  That's how it trades. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2691.66s)]
*  We play it our cards correct in certain ways. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2692.66s)]
*  And, you know, that's it. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2694.66s)]
*  But like I said, fair, it has to be fair. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2696.66s)]
*  Fairness is key here. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2699.66s)]
*  And that's what I push for them. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2702.66s)]
*  Since no Irish politician, well, you're one of the most, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2704.66s)]
*  maybe the most famous living Irishman, okay, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2709.66s)]
*  so there's that, world famous. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2712.66s)]
*  And you're saying things that the overwhelming majority [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2714.66s)]
*  of your politicians will not say [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2716.66s)]
*  that are probably pretty popular with the people. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2718.7s)]
*  So you're therefore a massive threat [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2720.7s)]
*  to the structure running your country now. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2722.7s)]
*  What do you think they're going to do to you [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2725.7s)]
*  if you keep talking this way? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2727.7s)]
*  Attempt to tarnish as they are, you know, [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2731.7s)]
*  attempt to disrupt as they are, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2734.7s)]
*  or possibly worse. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2736.7s)]
*  But I do not fear. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2738.7s)]
*  I do not fear it. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2740.7s)]
*  Like I said, I move forward under God. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2741.7s)]
*  And my nation can see, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2743.7s)]
*  my nation can see my heart and what I'm for. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2745.74s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2748.74s)]
*  That's like I move on and carry on. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2750.74s)]
*  You're really not afraid at all? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2752.74s)]
*  Not a night out there. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2754.74s)]
*  Hmm. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2756.74s)]
*  When do you have to make the decision [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2757.74s)]
*  about whether you want to formally enter politics? [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2759.74s)]
*  Well, we believe the election will take place November 11th. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2761.74s)]
*  So it's a 60-day rule prior to that. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2765.74s)]
*  So I'm just going to keep, you know, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2768.74s)]
*  requesting a democratic process to play out. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2770.74s)]
*  And allow the people to decide and see where it falls. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2774.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, it'll become more evident if they deny this [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2778.7799999999997s)]
*  that we are not a democratic country. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2781.7799999999997s)]
*  And they'll have to answer to their constituents [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2783.7799999999997s)]
*  at some stage, you know, there will be accountability. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2785.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, it's how much are they going to be accountable for. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2788.7799999999997s)]
*  They'll have to decide. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2791.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2793.7799999999997s)]
*  You've described yourself as an employer. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2794.7799999999997s)]
*  You said that a couple of times. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2796.7799999999997s)]
*  Tell us about the businesses you employ people in. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2798.7799999999997s)]
*  I've got many businesses here in the country. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2800.7799999999997s)]
*  I've got about 300 staff all in. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2802.82s)]
*  I've got public houses. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2804.82s)]
*  I've got construction efforts going on. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2806.82s)]
*  Public houses meaning we would call them bars. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2808.82s)]
*  Not public housing. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2810.82s)]
*  No, yeah. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2812.82s)]
*  Public pub is short for public house. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2813.82s)]
*  So I've got public houses. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2816.82s)]
*  I've got breweries. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2818.82s)]
*  I've got companies also. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2819.82s)]
*  We're brand building. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2821.82s)]
*  And I have also construction efforts. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2823.82s)]
*  I'm building many social houses. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2825.82s)]
*  Houses towards the housing crisis that's going on. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2827.82s)]
*  I'm currently about 300 houses built already. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2831.86s)]
*  And I'm closing in on my next venture is about 1,000 houses built. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2834.86s)]
*  So I'm doing my part to help this housing crisis. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2838.86s)]
*  I've always been doing that. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2842.86s)]
*  And it is at a heavy cost. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2844.86s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2846.86s)]
*  It's a heavy cost. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2847.86s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2848.86s)]
*  Like there is no profit in it. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2849.86s)]
*  You know, it's a build and it's for the people. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2851.86s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2854.86s)]
*  There's no profit in building houses? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2855.86s)]
*  No profit in it. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2857.86s)]
*  You know, for social housing, I get my money back in. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2858.86s)]
*  I get my money back if I'm lucky. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2860.9s)]
*  You know, maybe a little sweet and a little drink, we'll say, here in Ireland. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2862.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2866.9s)]
*  So, but for the stress it does cause me and the time. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2867.9s)]
*  It's a difficult task, but it's worth it. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2871.9s)]
*  You know, there was a time, there was one I'd done. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2874.9s)]
*  I completed a build of eight houses. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2876.9s)]
*  It was actually my very first one. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2878.9s)]
*  It was maybe two years ago. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2879.9s)]
*  I've only, I've only, I've only, I've only maybe three, four years ago. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2881.9s)]
*  But it was in a part of Dublin called Santry. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2885.9s)]
*  And there was eight homes and I had got them completed just before Christmas. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2888.94s)]
*  So there were eight homeless families that were brought into their new, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2892.94s)]
*  forever home right before Christmas. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2896.94s)]
*  And that filled me with such energy to continue and go and do it. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2899.94s)]
*  And I went full steam ahead. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2902.94s)]
*  And like I said, now I'm in the process. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2903.94s)]
*  I've got 300 strong now in construction, close to finish. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2905.94s)]
*  And, you know, more than a thousand being built already. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2908.94s)]
*  And that's what me, my own self, able to do this. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2912.94s)]
*  With every block in my way, you know, as one individual citizen of Ireland, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2915.98s)]
*  if I was to get in and to have influence, I really fancy my chances. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2922.98s)]
*  I mean, the bar is so low. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2928.98s)]
*  Every statistic, every metric is on the floor. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2931.98s)]
*  Every metric is on the floor. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2935.98s)]
*  I'd get in and I'd be able to, we have to decrease our homelessness, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2937.98s)]
*  you know, build our housing, you know, slow down the rollout. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2940.98s)]
*  Slow down the roll of influx of illegal migration. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2945.02s)]
*  Control the spending. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2948.02s)]
*  I fancy it. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2949.02s)]
*  Our country has not been run correct. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2950.02s)]
*  And it is clearly evident to everybody outside of the political paywall. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2952.02s)]
*  Everyone is aware of it. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2958.02s)]
*  And even those inside of the political paywall are also aware of it. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2959.02s)]
*  However, they are being bullied, intimidated and threatened [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2964.02s)]
*  with their livelihood unless they go along with it. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2967.02s)]
*  So a turn will happen. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2969.02s)]
*  A shift will happen. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2971.02s)]
*  I'm doing my part. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2972.06s)]
*  And I'm proud to do so and honored to do so. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2974.06s)]
*  And I will continue to fight for my country and the future [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2976.06s)]
*  of the children of this nation. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2980.06s)]
*  And that's it. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2982.06s)]
*  Do you really sincerely, be honest, think that your beer is better than Guinness? [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2983.06s)]
*  So it's another level. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2987.06s)]
*  It's the world's creamiest stout. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2989.06s)]
*  Not only is it better tasting, it is better pricing. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2991.06s)]
*  It is brewed right here in Dublin. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2994.06s)]
*  And there's an employer of about 100 people in that brewery. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2995.06s)]
*  It's a fantastic brewery. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2998.06s)]
*  And the Forge Brewery, you can go and visit it if you have time. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=2999.06s)]
*  But we will go and test it if you wish. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3001.1s)]
*  I would fancy a blind taste test any day of the week. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3003.1s)]
*  And I guarantee victory. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3007.1s)]
*  We have done amazing things with the stout to date. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3008.1s)]
*  And it's still only on the rise. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3013.1s)]
*  But there have been many taste tests done. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3014.1s)]
*  So there's a couple of stouts. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3017.1s)]
*  Guinness is the top at the minute. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3018.1s)]
*  We are number two on the rise. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3020.1s)]
*  And then there's some other brands. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3021.1s)]
*  You know, there's some other great Irish brands, Morpheus and Beamish. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3023.1s)]
*  It's a shared pot. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3026.1s)]
*  A rising tide raises all ships. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3027.1s)]
*  The others are bullies. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3028.14s)]
*  Yeah, the others are bullies. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3029.14s)]
*  I wish to build up all our stouts. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3030.14s)]
*  Because Ireland, we are world champions at making stout. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3033.14s)]
*  Like we are the world champions at making whiskey. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3036.14s)]
*  Put them all to the test. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3038.14s)]
*  On a blind taste test, Forge Irish Stout. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3040.14s)]
*  It's just a little weird. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3043.14s)]
*  I guess I didn't realize that Guinness was an English company. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3044.14s)]
*  Guinness is the actual one, yes. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3047.14s)]
*  And they were... [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3049.14s)]
*  Centuries of colonial oppression and they're still selling their stout here? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3050.14s)]
*  You know, if you're not having a good time, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3054.14s)]
*  or you're free to do as you will, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3056.18s)]
*  that is what it is with Guinness. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3058.18s)]
*  Even as they go in. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3060.18s)]
*  I'm a publican also, so I own pubs. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3061.18s)]
*  So I deal with Guinness. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3063.18s)]
*  And I serve Guinness. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3064.18s)]
*  I serve my competitor, no problem. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3065.18s)]
*  We outsell it ten to one. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3067.18s)]
*  Ten points to one we outsell it on site. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3068.18s)]
*  But other publicans are dealing with Guinness distributors. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3071.18s)]
*  And they're not friendly, they're not supportive. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3076.18s)]
*  Because they've never had to be in. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3079.18s)]
*  And then when I came onto the scene with Forge Irish Stout, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3080.18s)]
*  all of a sudden they start coming and shaking the publican's hand [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3083.22s)]
*  a little bit differently. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3086.22s)]
*  They start acting Irish. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3087.22s)]
*  They were held accountable. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3088.22s)]
*  They had to be by the book. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3089.22s)]
*  It was creating fairness. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3091.22s)]
*  And then there was a hit job done on me [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3093.22s)]
*  and it kind of took me out of the market here in Ireland for a minute [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3095.22s)]
*  and that's kind of what happened. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3098.22s)]
*  And it is what it is, you know. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3100.22s)]
*  But I have the best stout in Ireland, Forge Irish Stout for sure. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3103.22s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3106.22s)]
*  And you're going to have one. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3107.22s)]
*  You don't drink tea, you don't drink wine. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3108.22s)]
*  No, I had a Guinness No Alcohol last night. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3110.2599999999998s)]
*  We can get you one of them. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3113.2599999999998s)]
*  We've got the zero-zeros on site for sure. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3114.2599999999998s)]
*  We'll get you one of them. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3117.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it was OK. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3118.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, that's nice. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3119.2599999999998s)]
*  So in sad news, I know you said you're looking at the bright side [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3120.2599999999998s)]
*  kind of guy, but Rosie O'Donnell has moved here. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3125.2599999999998s)]
*  If you're president and you tackle the immigration crisis [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3129.2599999999998s)]
*  and I do think Pakistan and India take a lot of the blame [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3133.2599999999998s)]
*  for the immigration crisis, [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3136.2599999999998s)]
*  but also Rosie O'Donnell, would you deport her? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3137.3s)]
*  Can you promise to deport her? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3140.3s)]
*  What is her criminal history? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3142.3s)]
*  Has she got a criminal background? [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3143.3s)]
*  How does she enter the country? [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3144.3s)]
*  Does she enter the country illegally? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3145.3s)]
*  Has she assimilated with our community? [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3146.3s)]
*  Does she hold our beliefs? [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3149.3s)]
*  Is she an upstanding member of our community? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3150.3s)]
*  No! [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3154.3s)]
*  Or would she be? [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3155.3s)]
*  If she is not, well then she's got to go. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3156.3s)]
*  You ain't got to go home, you got to get the head out of here. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3158.3s)]
*  But I don't know Rosie O'Donnell from Adam. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3160.3s)]
*  I believe she's a comedian. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3163.34s)]
*  I've seen her on our national TV. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3164.34s)]
*  She spoke a bit ill of me. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3167.34s)]
*  I don't know Rosie. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3168.34s)]
*  She seems unhappy. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3169.34s)]
*  She seems going through something at the moment. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3170.34s)]
*  And I'm not the type of person to kick a person when they're down. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3173.34s)]
*  I wish for her. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3176.34s)]
*  I believe she's a comedian is what her craft is. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3177.34s)]
*  I wish for her to find her happiness again. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3179.34s)]
*  And that is it. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3182.34s)]
*  That would be what I would say. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3183.34s)]
*  But you could feel that she's a comedian. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3186.34s)]
*  She's a comedian. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3188.34s)]
*  She's a comedian. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3189.34s)]
*  She's a comedian. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3190.34s)]
*  That would be what I would say. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3191.38s)]
*  But you could feel that she was going through something. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3192.38s)]
*  I could feel it for sure. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3194.38s)]
*  And I wish for her. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3196.38s)]
*  I wish happiness and spread love in the world. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3197.38s)]
*  That's it. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3200.38s)]
*  Well you're a very, very decent man I have to say. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3201.38s)]
*  Last question. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3204.38s)]
*  Do you think that Ireland is famously a spiritual country? [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3205.38s)]
*  You know your patron Saint Patrick after whom the day is named was a Christian leader. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3210.38s)]
*  And you think of Ireland as a very religious country. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3215.38s)]
*  It's not really anymore. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3217.38s)]
*  Do you think it's becoming more spiritually aware or less? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3219.42s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3222.42s)]
*  So you feel that? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3223.42s)]
*  Yeah for sure. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3225.42s)]
*  It's spiritual warfare going on right here. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3226.42s)]
*  100%. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3229.42s)]
*  And we fancy our chances. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3230.42s)]
*  We fancy our chances in a big way. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3233.42s)]
*  Me too. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3236.42s)]
*  Conor McGregor, thank you very much. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3237.42s)]
*  Polka Carlton, thank you very much. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3238.42s)]
*  That was awesome. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3240.42s)]
*  There you go. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3241.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3242.42s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3243.46s)]
*  On one level that's not surprising, that's what they do. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3251.46s)]
*  But on another level it's shocking. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3253.46s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3255.46s)]
*  our economy and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, Google [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3258.46s)]
*  has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3264.46s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3268.46s)]
*  It's immoral. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3270.46s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3271.46s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3272.5s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3273.5s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3274.5s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3275.5s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3276.5s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3281.5s)]
*  Subscribe. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3285.5s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3286.5s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3290.5s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLEA8XoxPIg&t=3295.5s)]
