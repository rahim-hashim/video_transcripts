# JD Vance The New Opposition Party, Saving Rural America, & Why Trump Seeks Advice From His Gardener
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2.0s)]
*  I'm very psyched to be here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=4.0s)]
*  I was just, I was coming in [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=6.0s)]
*  backstage, this is our 11th city [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=8.0s)]
*  we've been in this month. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=10.0s)]
*  And you have a kind of formula [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=12.0s)]
*  for how things work. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=14.0s)]
*  And I'm standing backstage and I [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=16.0s)]
*  see this ice bucket full of green [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=18.0s)]
*  bottles. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=20.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=22.0s)]
*  make a video about it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=24.0s)]
*  And I'm like, I'm going to make a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=26.0s)]
*  video about it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=28.0s)]
*  And I'm standing in the podium [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=30.0s)]
*  and I see this ice bucket full of [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=32.0s)]
*  green bottles. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=34.0s)]
*  And I reach my hand under what it [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=36.0s)]
*  was. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=38.0s)]
*  It's Mountain Dew. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=40.0s)]
*  And I said, I said, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=42.0s)]
*  Why do we have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=44.0s)]
*  Mountain Dew? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=46.0s)]
*  JD Vance drinks Mountain Dew. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=48.0s)]
*  Actually [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=50.0s)]
*  drinks Mountain Dew. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=52.0s)]
*  And I know JD Vance very well, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=54.0s)]
*  politics. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=56.0s)]
*  But you often hear people say, and you can feel it on him, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=57.2s)]
*  he's not, he went to Yale Law School, you know, he's not really from Appalachia. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=60.32s)]
*  I found the Mountain Dew. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=65.64s)]
*  That's for real. You're not, you're not drinking this. They don't have this at the Aspen Institute, trust me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=69.76s)]
*  I was so impressed. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=76.84s)]
*  And I'm very sympathetic to, I love actually his politics, but I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna try that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=78.88s)]
*  Sorry. I'm gonna buy a little Perrier. I'm not a man of the people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=84.60000000000001s)]
*  Anyway, thank you so much [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  for coming. I'm sorry it took so long to get in. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=91.84s)]
*  This is what happens when your security is run by your opponent, I think. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  It's kind of hard to have an event. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=102.56s)]
*  It's sort of a, it's a funny system that we have. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=108.16000000000001s)]
*  No other country does that, I don't think. We'll just, we'll take care of security, don't worry. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=111.64s)]
*  And just to make it super efficient, we're gonna let the TSA handle it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=116.84s)]
*  Because when you want things to work smoothly, like when you're late for your flight on Memorial Day weekend, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=123.44s)]
*  anyway, so I'm sorry about that. We had no control over it. I'm not alleging anything other than what's totally obvious. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=131.32s)]
*  Oh, that's just amused me. And I heard the media are here. I don't know, I know. Boo, boo, boo, boo, boo. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  And I heard even the New York Times, Politico? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=149.88s)]
*  They're all here. No, I don't know. I just want them to stand up and announce who they're voting for if they would. I don't know. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  I don't have my glasses on, so I don't know where they are. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=160.48s)]
*  I can't hear what you're saying, but I know I agree with you if, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=165.6s)]
*  if you were trying to express loathing, I'm on your side. And by the way, I would know, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=169.44s)]
*  having spent over 30 years in their lair and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=175.68s)]
*  no amount of Sonic cold plunge, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=179.8s)]
*  hot bath combinations can scrape off the moral stain of us all the time that I spent there. But anyway, thank you so much. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=183.32s)]
*  So I'm gonna, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=190.56s)]
*  because we're running a little late, I want to get to the interview with Senator Vance pretty quickly. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=192.84s)]
*  But I just wanted to say, and it's much more interesting than anything I'm gonna say anyway, but I just want to [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=198.84s)]
*  say something that he knows really well because he's been on the road since the convention, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=204.24s)]
*  but I'm just remembering since it's been a long time since I've been on the road, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=207.68s)]
*  which is that if you experience your country, the one that you were born in, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=211.12s)]
*  and that you love and your ancestors built and you will die in America, if you experience it [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=216.32s)]
*  through your phone, which I hate to admit is mostly the way I do experience it, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=221.96s)]
*  you really get a distorted picture of it. And [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=227.28s)]
*  it feels like a country at war with itself. And in fact, we're told that very often. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=230.28s)]
*  This country is on the brink of civil war. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=234.32s)]
*  And everybody hates everybody else on the basis of some immutable characteristic, the base of race primarily, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=236.4s)]
*  but also of sex and then political affiliation. And basically America is about to explode. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=242.56s)]
*  It's the crock pot you forgot to turn off and it's about to just blow up and wreck your kitchen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=248.76s)]
*  I love that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=258.44s)]
*  You know, it might be kind of an unsequitur like scream out a 1970s or a Leonard Skinner song in the middle of a pause, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=260.76s)]
*  but to me, I'm grooving with you, baby. I know exactly what you mean. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=267.04s)]
*  That's right. I can't quite articulate what you mean, but I know what you mean. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=271.56s)]
*  Free bird. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=277.47999999999996s)]
*  Anyway, the point is you really get the sense that the country is at war with itself and that people really hate each other and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=279.47999999999996s)]
*  when you travel it and we're going coast to coast for a month, we already have been coast to coast, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  that's not the experience you have at all. Like at all, actually. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=291.96s)]
*  I can just tell you as officially in the New York Times has chronicled this at great length as one of the most hated people [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=296.79999999999995s)]
*  in the world, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  I kind of expected to be yelled at, you know what I mean, at like an airport or a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=304.04s)]
*  Starbucks or the lobby of a hotel. Not one time. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=309.04s)]
*  And I, no, it has nothing to do with me. It's not because I'm so great or people secretly love me. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=312.12s)]
*  It's that Americans secretly don't really hate each other, which is kind of amazing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=318.16s)]
*  When was the, no, it's true. They don't. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=323.88s)]
*  And yet they have been convinced that they do and they have in fact been inspired to hate each other [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=327.88s)]
*  systematically for decades and I've watched this. The entire presentation of [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=335.0s)]
*  American history, again driven by the New York Times, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=339.24s)]
*  I've got to say wherever the correspondent is, the entire presentation of American history is designed to make you believe [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=342.12s)]
*  that this is a country based on hate, the hate of Americans for each other and they have been telling us, well [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=348.44s)]
*  I'm 55 so they've been telling it for at least the 50 years I can remember going to school, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=354.92s)]
*  they've been telling us this version and that that, you know, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=359.12s)]
*  that is the core problem of the countries, that people really really hate each other and looking back on it, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=362.32s)]
*  I've been thinking of it all week. I [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=367.32s)]
*  don't think I've ever seen that ever. Not one time. And what I see actually is just the opposite. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=369.6s)]
*  I see people of all backgrounds and all beliefs [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=375.2s)]
*  totally determined to get along with each other and doing it despite the encouragement of their leaders. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=381.68s)]
*  And I just think, I think two things about that. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=388.8s)]
*  One, I think it's quite revealing of our leaders [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=393.24s)]
*  because what leader wants the people he leads to hate each other? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=397.92s)]
*  That's like really the kind of the darkest thing you could ever want. If you're a parent, you know [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=401.64s)]
*  it is evil. It is the definition of evil. What parent wants his or her kids to hate each other? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=406.72s)]
*  You want the opposite. Because when you die, the one thing you leave behind is [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=412.16s)]
*  the love of your children for each other. That's how your memory continues because your children love each other. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=417.08s)]
*  Almost no parent needs to have this explained. Every parent knows it intuitively. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=424.08s)]
*  And it's not just the family, the most basic and important organization [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=427.92s)]
*  in human civilization. It's every organization from your office to a military unit to your state to your country. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=432.52s)]
*  Leaders have as their first and most sacred duty [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=440.0s)]
*  the responsibility [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=444.6s)]
*  to unite the people who follow them, to keep them whole, to keep them together. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=446.96s)]
*  And to do the opposite of that [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=451.76s)]
*  systematically over decades using the media primarily, but also now just from the podium, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=456.12s)]
*  is evil. It's absolutely evil because it's a perfect inversion of their duty. And they have tried harder than really any task. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  They certainly haven't put their effort into managing the economy or paving the roads or making it safe to walk to CBS. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=470.32s)]
*  They've done just the opposite because they've been so focused on making us hate each other. That's the first thing I noticed. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=476.5s)]
*  So they're not just incompetent. They're really bad on a deep level, actually. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=482.94s)]
*  No country deserves the leaders that we have. No state deserves leaders you have, by the way, I can say. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=488.34000000000003s)]
*  I've spent so much time in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and I always think to myself, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  how is the worst place in the state allowed to run the entire state? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=499.7s)]
*  I'm not going to name it. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=505.34s)]
*  But why do they have all the power? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=508.5s)]
*  Why do the people with the longest track record of failure have total control over the rest of the state, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=510.06s)]
*  which is beautiful and filled with great people? How does that work? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=515.18s)]
*  That doesn't look like democracy to me. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=518.3s)]
*  But you can extrapolate outward to an entire country and say, how does a country of 350 million great people [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=520.02s)]
*  have such rotten leaders? And that really is a theological question that I can't answer, but it does. And here's the last thing [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=526.78s)]
*  I'll say before introducing Senator J.D. Vance, my friend. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=533.46s)]
*  They haven't succeeded. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=539.94s)]
*  And that is something to marvel at and to celebrate and to really deeply think about. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=542.6600000000001s)]
*  Everyone's always shocked, particularly in these last four years, since, I'll put it precisely, since Memorial Day 2020, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=548.62s)]
*  when the revolution began, without telling us, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=554.82s)]
*  and the country that you grew up in and all of its institutions turned upside down and things you really loved and respected disappeared, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=557.86s)]
*  and people who are close to you vanished from your life. And really, it's been chaotic since then, all by design. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=565.1800000000001s)]
*  And everyone I know, I think most people who are paying attention, have had a curse to them at one time or another, like, wow, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=571.58s)]
*  there's so much evil in the world, I'm shocked. And that's true, clearly. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=576.1800000000001s)]
*  But what too few people, very much including me, pause to consider is how much good [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=580.14s)]
*  there is in the world, good that makes no sense. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=584.6999999999999s)]
*  The love between people who don't know each other, who have nothing obviously in common, except their common [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=587.98s)]
*  Americanness, their citizenship here, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=596.66s)]
*  people who are not gaining anything by being kind to each other, in fact, who are encouraged not to be kind to each other and are anyway. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=599.42s)]
*  What's that? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=606.42s)]
*  That is as every bit as unnatural as the evil that we see. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=608.38s)]
*  It does not exist in nature. It is outside of nature. It is super natural. And that is moving among us too. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=613.22s)]
*  And I think it's worth celebrating that. And if you look around this room, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=621.46s)]
*  the first thing you realize is, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=625.78s)]
*  all that stuff they told you about how you were crazy, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=628.74s)]
*  because you noticed. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=631.5400000000001s)]
*  Turns out you're not crazy, because there are thousands of people sitting right next to you who had exactly the same instincts. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=634.62s)]
*  And they came from very different places to arrive at the same destination, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=641.02s)]
*  which is a commitment to being honest with themselves and those around them. That's all it is, is honesty. It's not political. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=649.74s)]
*  It's not ideological. It's being unwilling to lie. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=656.26s)]
*  And every person in this room at one level or another, at one time or another, has arrived at the exact same conclusion, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=659.94s)]
*  which is, I'm just gonna say what I think is true. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=665.98s)]
*  And it turns out it's not just you sitting alone in your rec room throwing beer cans at the TV, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=668.94s)]
*  feeling like a freak. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=675.4200000000001s)]
*  It's most people in this country. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=677.66s)]
*  And there's no greater blessing than knowing that. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  So on that note of totally non-political hope, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=686.46s)]
*  I want to introduce Senator JD Vance of Ohio, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=691.54s)]
*  running with Donald Trump. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=695.9s)]
*  So you actually do drink Mountain Dew, you're not joking? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=698.02s)]
*  Diet Mountain Dew, yeah. Yeah, it's my favorite drink. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=701.1800000000001s)]
*  You need a lot of caffeine on the campaign trail. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=704.94s)]
*  Though it's interesting, it's become a bit of a thing, because I probably had like one Diet Mountain Dew a week [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=708.38s)]
*  before I started running for vice president. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=713.82s)]
*  And then I like started talking about it, and then people always brought me Diet Mountain Dews, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=716.62s)]
*  so now I drink like three of them a week, one of many ways in which my health has gotten much worse. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=719.98s)]
*  So you're not endorsing it from a medical standpoint, is that what you're saying? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=725.02s)]
*  No, no, not at all. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=729.26s)]
*  But I will say Tucker, it's awesome to be here, not just like because I've been looking forward to this, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=731.26s)]
*  but two hours ago, I was thinking to myself, I'm gonna have to call Tucker and cancel, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=736.3s)]
*  like I'm not gonna be able to come. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=741.66s)]
*  And the reason is because we have our kids with us, and I took my boys on the campaign trail, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=744.14s)]
*  we did a bunch of events all over Pennsylvania, which is a great state, and it's great to be here. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=749.82s)]
*  And we go to Hershey Park, right, which is just across the street. Hershey Park's great. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=754.14s)]
*  And my son says, my seven-year-old says, if I go on a roller coaster with you, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=761.66s)]
*  you have to go on this like spinny ride with me. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=767.3399999999999s)]
*  And so legitimately, it's one of these things where it's not just spinning around, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=770.62s)]
*  but then the thing that you're sitting in is also spinning around. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=775.42s)]
*  So it's like spinning within spinning. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=777.74s)]
*  And legitimately, three and a half seconds in, I think to myself, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=779.9s)]
*  I'm gonna throw up all over this ride. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=783.66s)]
*  And my, you know, it's like now that I'm a vice presidential candidate, I'm much more, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=786.38s)]
*  you know, people know who I am. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=791.9s)]
*  And so there are like 10 separate iPhones that are tuned on me. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=793.5s)]
*  And all I can think to myself is if I throw up in this thing, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=799.1800000000001s)]
*  it's gonna be like one of those old sprinklers, you know, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=803.42s)]
*  tuk tuk tuk tuk tuk. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=806.3s)]
*  So I like white knuckle, close my eyes, my seven-year-old and my four-year-old like, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=811.5799999999999s)]
*  dad, what's going on? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=817.26s)]
*  I'm like, I'm trying not to throw up boys, just, you know, leave daddy be. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=817.9799999999999s)]
*  And then we get off the ride and I am so nauseous. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=822.3s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna have to cancel tonight because I'm gonna go home to the hotel. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=826.14s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're looking at it wrong. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=829.5s)]
*  Puking on the Tilted Whirl is the most authentically American thing you could do. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=830.9399999999999s)]
*  No one would ever call you a phony again. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=834.3s)]
*  I booted on the Tilted Whirl. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=837.9799999999999s)]
*  I mean, honestly, from Mountain Dew. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=839.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=845.02s)]
*  So anyway, I'm feeling a lot better now and it's great to be with you. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=845.26s)]
*  And how's it going? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=849.26s)]
*  Well, you tell me you're running for national office. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=851.5s)]
*  I don't even know what I do for a living at this point. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=856.3s)]
*  Neither do I. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=860.54s)]
*  Why? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=861.1s)]
*  So where, I mean, it's always hard asking someone who's running for office, like, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=863.1s)]
*  do you think you're going to win? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=867.1s)]
*  Where are we? [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=867.98s)]
*  But I would say, and you explained this so well in a conversation we had recently, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=869.1800000000001s)]
*  the polls really are designed to deceive many of the public polls, probably not all, but many. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=872.46s)]
*  And the campaigns, not just yours, but the Democrat Party's campaign, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=877.1s)]
*  do have access to the most accurate polls. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=881.58s)]
*  So, you know, being as honest as you can be, where are we? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=884.78s)]
*  Where we are is we're going to win. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=889.02s)]
*  And I feel 100% confident about that. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=890.38s)]
*  Look, if you go back in time four years, there was a poll in the run-up to the 2020 election, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=900.38s)]
*  maybe the 2016 election actually, that had Donald Trump losing Wisconsin by 17 points. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=907.18s)]
*  Okay. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=912.7s)]
*  And of course, in 2016, he won with the state of Wisconsin. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=913.34s)]
*  And what you realize is the purpose of these polls is very often subversion. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=916.62s)]
*  Like, they're trying to depress you. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=922.62s)]
*  So they put out a poll in Wisconsin that says Donald Trump is going to lose by 17 points, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=924.94s)]
*  even though that's an election he eventually went on to win. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=929.74s)]
*  And I think that there's a lot of that happening right now, though, I will say, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=932.46s)]
*  even with the idea that the polls are fundamentally biased, I mean, you know, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=936.86s)]
*  we have internal polls that we pay a lot more money for because it's, I mean, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=941.1s)]
*  this is a very nerdy point, but you have to reach the right people to actually get an accurate poll. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=944.7s)]
*  And because most Trump supporters, like if you called my family members and said, hey, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=950.22s)]
*  I'm from such and such research, are you going to vote for Donald Trump? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=955.9000000000001s)]
*  They would say, F you and hang up the phone, right? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=958.86s)]
*  So because of that, it's very hard to poll actual Donald Trump supporters. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=963.6600000000001s)]
*  But you can if you're willing to actually go out and seek those people and do the right things. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=968.46s)]
*  And look, the internal polls are great. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=974.22s)]
*  I think that we have to work our rear ends off over the next 45 days. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=976.62s)]
*  And, you know, there's the there's something really interesting about this election Tucker, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=980.9399999999999s)]
*  which is that if you sort of take the people who voted in 2020 versus the people who voted for [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=986.14s)]
*  Biden in 2020, the people voted for Trump in 2020, we're probably about even there. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=992.46s)]
*  Like I'd sort of go to 50 50 chance, but there are a lot of marginal voters, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=996.38s)]
*  meaning people who don't always show up to the polls. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1000.7s)]
*  And if they show up, they're like 70 30 for Donald Trump. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1003.26s)]
*  So it's basically the name of the game is you can't get depressed and give up on your country. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1006.86s)]
*  You have to get out there and vote because if you do, we're going to win. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1013.82s)]
*  So get out there and vote and we'll win. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1016.62s)]
*  And the so I mean, look, the the story, the story of basically the last 30 years in my view [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1019.0200000000001s)]
*  is that our leadership has turned the American people into paupers in their own country. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1030.14s)]
*  Right. You're not going to own anything. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1035.98s)]
*  God, you know, no way you're going to own a house because the leadership has made it [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1038.22s)]
*  way too expensive to buy a house. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1041.8200000000002s)]
*  And plus interest rates are too high. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1043.5800000000002s)]
*  You're not going to have real public safety in your communities because we're going to [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1045.5800000000002s)]
*  import 25 million people. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1049.0200000000002s)]
*  We're going to overstress the legal system. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1050.7800000000002s)]
*  We're going to overstress the police system. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1053.18s)]
*  You're not actually going to have a decent job because we want to ship [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1055.1000000000001s)]
*  way too many middle class jobs off to China, off to Mexico. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1059.02s)]
*  And so the American people, I think they're fed up with it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1062.7s)]
*  They're saying we don't give a shit what you think about us. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1065.82s)]
*  We're going to vote for our own interests and we're going to vote to save our country. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1068.06s)]
*  But but the thing that is that is really meaningful and, you know, if I worry about anything, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1071.66s)]
*  it's that we're going to get lazy and we're going to rest on our laurels and we're not [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1080.7s)]
*  going to get out there and actually pound the pavement and vote. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1084.22s)]
*  There are way too many people who know that the country is broken, who know that Kamala [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1087.26s)]
*  Harris would make a terrible president, but they have to actually get out there and do [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1091.18s)]
*  the thing that all of us have to do, which is vote. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1096.0600000000002s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1098.0600000000002s)]
*  We did an interview a couple of weeks ago with a woman called Casey Means. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1098.8600000000001s)]
*  She's a Stanford educated surgeon and really one of the most remarkable people I have ever [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1103.3400000000001s)]
*  met. In the interview, she explained how the food that we eat produced by huge food [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1109.1000000000001s)]
*  companies, Big Food, in conjunction with Pharma, is destroying our health, making this a weak [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1115.58s)]
*  and sick country. The levels of chronic disease are beyond belief. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1121.8999999999999s)]
*  What Casey Means, who we've not stopped thinking about ever since, is the co-founder of a health [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1127.02s)]
*  care technology company called Levels. And we are proud to announce today that we are [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1132.62s)]
*  partnering with Levels. And by proud, I mean sincerely proud. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1137.26s)]
*  Levels is a really interesting company and a great product. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1141.42s)]
*  It gives you insight into what's going on inside your body, your metabolic health. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1144.46s)]
*  It helps you understand how the food that you're eating, the things that you're doing [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1149.18s)]
*  every single day, are affecting your body in real time. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1152.7s)]
*  You put stuff in your mouth, speaking for myself anyway, and you don't think about it. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1156.1399999999999s)]
*  You have no idea what you're putting in your mouth and you have no idea what it's doing to your body. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1161.26s)]
*  But over time, you feel weak and tired and spacey and over an even longer period of time, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1164.38s)]
*  you can get really sick. So it's worth knowing what the food you eat is doing to you. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1170.7800000000002s)]
*  The Levels app works with something called the Continuous Glucose Monitor, a CGM. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1176.7800000000002s)]
*  You can get one as part of the plan or you can bring your own. It doesn't matter. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1181.74s)]
*  But the bottom line is Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Food combine together to form an incredibly [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1185.2600000000002s)]
*  malevolent force, pumping you full of garbage on healthy food with artificial sugars and hurting [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1192.94s)]
*  you and hurting the entire country. So with Levels, you'll be able to see immediately what all this is [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1199.5s)]
*  doing to you. You get access to real-time personalized data and that's a critical step [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1203.66s)]
*  to changing your behavior. Those of us who like Oreos can tell you firsthand. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1208.78s)]
*  This isn't talking to your doctor at an annual physical, looking backwards about things you did [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1213.5s)]
*  in the past. This is up to the second information on how your body is responding to different foods [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1218.22s)]
*  and activities, the things that give you stress, your sleep, etc. It's easy to use, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1224.3s)]
*  gives you powerful personalized health data, and you can make much better choices [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1230.54s)]
*  about how you feel. And over time, it'll have a huge effect. Right now, you can get an additional [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1234.6200000000001s)]
*  two free months when you go to levels.link.tucker. That's levels.link.tucker. This is the beginning [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1239.5s)]
*  of what we hope will be a long and happy partnership with Levels and Dr. Casey Means. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1247.02s)]
*  So there's been this thing happening for the last, well, last eight years actually, but it seems to [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1252.78s)]
*  have come to a head in the last several months where the realignment is now very obvious between [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1260.3799999999999s)]
*  the parties. And you do see a bunch of pretty high-profile Democrats coming to your campaign, [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1266.7s)]
*  to endorse your campaign, and you see honestly some high-profile Republicans go over to Kamala [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1273.58s)]
*  Harris. So just to put it in one sentence, you got Bobby Kennedy and they got Dick Cheney and his [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1279.1799999999998s)]
*  horrible daughter. A hell of a trade, by the way. I'll take that trade every day and twice on Sunday. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1284.78s)]
*  And I didn't mean to, I can't remember names. I'm going to go with horrible daughter, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1290.9399999999998s)]
*  but I think it's fair. How would you describe that realignment? What is that? [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1294.3799999999999s)]
*  Well, I think there are a couple of things going on. So first of all, if you spend any time in [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1300.38s)]
*  professional Washington, which I've spent a couple of years there, you realize that one of the things [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1304.94s)]
*  that gives a lot of people meaning is like playing a chess game with the lives of other people's [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1309.3400000000001s)]
*  children, right? And of course, if you think like that, you're kind of a sicko and you shouldn't be [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1314.8600000000001s)]
*  anywhere near power, but Washington is full of people who really like to go out and play [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1320.3000000000002s)]
*  strategic games with the lives of other people's children. And there's probably [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1326.7s)]
*  nobody who better represents that, of course, than Liz and Dick Cheney, who their entire politics [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1331.1s)]
*  for the past 30 years has been using American power to inflame tensions in the world, to draw [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1338.62s)]
*  the United States deeper and deeper into foreign conflicts, which either shouldn't exist at all, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1345.8999999999999s)]
*  or certainly the United States shouldn't have any business in. And I think that the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1350.3s)]
*  United States should be involved in every stupid war in the world. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1356.06s)]
*  But and I think so that's one thing that's going on is if you don't think the United States should [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1361.26s)]
*  get involved in every stupid war in the world, then you're a Republican. And if you think the [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1366.62s)]
*  United States should send billions of dollars and tons of innocent Americans to die in some foreign [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1371.26s)]
*  country, then you're going to be a Democrat. And that's kind of crazy, right? Because it was sort [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1377.8999999999999s)]
*  of exactly the opposite probably 40, 50 years ago. But then there are other two other big issues, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1381.02s)]
*  the three things that really matter. One is foreign policy. The you know, our side, I think, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1386.3s)]
*  is rational and restrained. We don't want to fight every ridiculous war. And we're like worried [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1391.82s)]
*  about getting involved in World War Three, because we should be because we have nuclear weapons now. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1396.7s)]
*  And you have to be cautious about that stuff. The second big issue is, in my view, over immigration, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1401.18s)]
*  right? If you sort of look at the Liz Cheney, Dick Cheney view, their basic argument is, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1407.18s)]
*  let's flood the United States with millions upon millions of foreign laborers, because that's good [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1412.94s)]
*  for business. And there are those of us who are saying, well, is it actually good for social [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1420.3s)]
*  cohesion? Isn't it good for workers? Hell no. So we're not going to accept that. The third thing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1424.3s)]
*  And the third thing that I think really divides the parties, and it's you know, it's like me, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1429.5s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy, Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump, we're sort of all on the same page on this is, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1438.46s)]
*  do you think that the United States should ship its entire industrial base to foreign countries, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1443.02s)]
*  some of which hate us? And if you think that's insane, like I do, then you're gonna vote for [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1448.94s)]
*  Donald Trump. And if you think it's a great idea to ship our industrial base overseas, you're welcome [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1453.26s)]
*  in the party of Kamala Harris and Dick Cheney. And that's basically it. And those three issues, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1457.9s)]
*  Tucker, have divided people, I think have divided the entire country, but actually only the leadership [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1462.94s)]
*  class, because I actually think that like 70% of Americans agree with our viewpoint on these issues. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1470.8600000000001s)]
*  I just think that the leadership of this country has gotten so deranged that they convinced [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1477.02s)]
*  themselves that there's a great American majority for fighting a ton of wars, importing a ton of [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1481.98s)]
*  illegal aliens and shipping all the jobs overseas. And I just don't think there is. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1487.5s)]
*  I would say it's higher than 70% consensus. And you know that because the advocates of the positions [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1491.02s)]
*  you just described will never admit that they're advocating for them. No one will ever say, yeah, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1498.94s)]
*  we just brought in tens of millions of illegal aliens. They lie about the fact they did it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1503.02s)]
*  So clearly there's no constituency for that. No, that's exactly right. And you know, this has [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1508.46s)]
*  been a big issue with some of the microscope that's been put on communities that have accepted a large [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1513.02s)]
*  number of Haitian migrants in the past couple of years. So in Springfield, Ohio, about 20,000, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1519.02s)]
*  there's a community in Pennsylvania that I think is accepted about 2,500 in a town of about 4,000 [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1524.3s)]
*  people. So there are people who say that this is fundamentally necessary because unless you import [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1529.74s)]
*  all of these people, that there aren't going to be any jobs. And I actually think that sort of [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1538.06s)]
*  gets it exactly upside down. The reason why people left these communities is because our leadership [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1543.58s)]
*  shipped all of their jobs to Mexico and China and other countries. So if you want to fix the problem, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1550.54s)]
*  bring economic prosperity back to our country. Don't bring 2,500 or 25,000 foreign laborers [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1555.42s)]
*  into small town America. Amen. But it also raises, I think, an even deeper philosophical question, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1561.5s)]
*  which is who are you serving? Who's your loyalty to? I don't care how screwed up and fentanyl-ridden [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1569.74s)]
*  and post-industrial your little town is. The people who live there are American citizens and [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1576.78s)]
*  they own the government. And so the people in charge have to care about them, but they don't [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1581.82s)]
*  at all. They care about their donors who think that their businesses will benefit from importing [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1586.54s)]
*  an entirely new class of workers. But aren't our leaders required to care about the current [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1591.74s)]
*  occupants of those towns? I would think so. I would think so. Well, here's one way I'd put it. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1598.46s)]
*  And I picked this up, this is actually when we became friends initially, right? We were at some [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1607.02s)]
*  massive bankers conference and I had just written Hillbilly Elegy. I feel dirty thinking about it. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1612.38s)]
*  And I realized that what I had done in Hillbilly Elegy was write a very personal story about my [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1618.14s)]
*  grandmother and my mom and my sister and there's sort of triumph and there's trial and my mom [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1625.0200000000002s)]
*  struggled with addiction and then she got clean and my grandmother raised me. And it was very much [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1630.14s)]
*  a personal story. And what I realized at that conference and at others like it is that a lot [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1634.38s)]
*  of our leaders liked the book not because they really sort of sympathize with the story, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1640.54s)]
*  but it gave them an opportunity. They pick one paragraph out and say, oh, well, this thing shows [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1645.74s)]
*  that these middle American working class people are bad or they're racist or they're not worth [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1652.7s)]
*  focusing our attention on or we shouldn't save their jobs. Whatever they use as an excuse to [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1660.1399999999999s)]
*  ignore the citizens of their own country. And I started to feel kind of dirty about participating [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1664.46s)]
*  in this way that our leaders used my book to try to look down on their fellow citizens rather than [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1669.9s)]
*  maybe learn something about their fellow citizens and recommit them to making their lives better. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1676.8600000000001s)]
*  And that fundamental breakdown you see in our politics like all the time Tucker, because look, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1682.22s)]
*  there is nothing that pisses off America's leadership class. There's nothing that angers [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1688.7s)]
*  Kamala Harris more than when a working class person in the heartland of this country [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1694.94s)]
*  complains about what a bad job she's doing. And when you think about this charge that our leaders [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1700.46s)]
*  constantly make, they'll say, well, you don't want 20,000 low wage migrants showing up in your town. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1712.8600000000001s)]
*  You don't want to be evicted from your home to make way for four Haitian families who by the way [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1717.5800000000002s)]
*  are violating zoning laws to live in this house. You're a racist. That's what they'll say. Now, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1721.98s)]
*  think about this. What they're really doing is saying you are not allowed to speak up about our [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1727.9s)]
*  leadership screwing up. And when you realize this is the game that they play, I mean, look, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1734.3s)]
*  you and I agree with this. I think we should genuinely endeavor to look at every human being [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1739.34s)]
*  as a child of God, whether they're black, white, brown, or anything else. I think that is an [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1745.74s)]
*  absolutely good principle. But I think that when our leaders call working class citizens who have [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1749.66s)]
*  almost no power in America in 2024, when they call them racist, it's not because they're trying to [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1757.98s)]
*  call them to some higher meaning. They're not trying to convince them to be more compassionate [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1763.98s)]
*  to their fellow man. They're trying to silence them and shut them up. And when you realize [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1769.26s)]
*  that our leadership is willing to take the compassion, like what's best in us [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1774.5400000000002s)]
*  that we love our fellow man and we love our fellow Americans and use it as a weapon to [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1778.78s)]
*  silence people, you realize that Kamala Harris and everybody like her, it is a disgusting game [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1783.82s)]
*  that they play and we have to reject it. I couldn't agree more. I mean, I just say, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1789.34s)]
*  let me say again, I think it's evil. It's evil to leverage someone's decency against him. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1799.58s)]
*  Yes. It's the lowest possible thing you could do. But I have to ask, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1804.78s)]
*  and I don't really answer this question, but you've spent time on both sides, growing up in [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1808.14s)]
*  where you did in Ohio, going to Marine Corps, and then going to Yale and all that. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1813.5s)]
*  Go Ohio. It's more than just like getting people to shut up so they can loot the country, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1819.42s)]
*  which is clearly part of it. But there's a loathing, there's a hatred there. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1825.98s)]
*  Oh yes. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1829.8200000000002s)]
*  And I don't understand where that comes from. Why would you hate people who live in communities [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1830.6200000000001s)]
*  that your friends flooded with fentanyl? Why would you be mad at them? They're the ones whose [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1836.62s)]
*  life expectancy is going down. What did they do wrong? If there was ever a group of victims, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1842.4599999999998s)]
*  it's rural Americans. So why would you hate them? It doesn't make sense to me, but they do. Why? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1847.1799999999998s)]
*  So I don't know that I have a perfect answer to this, but I think that rural America and the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1853.82s)]
*  problems of rural America just show how much their entire worldview is broken. And so it sort of [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1858.6999999999998s)]
*  reflects back at them their own failure and their own lack of concern for their fellow citizens. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1865.82s)]
*  It's like one thing to say, well, we're going to ship all the jobs to China and we'll get a bunch [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1871.66s)]
*  of cheap plastic toys in exchange. Or oh, we're going to invade Iraq and yeah, it's going to be [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1877.18s)]
*  a total disaster and we'll kill a lot of innocent people, but we don't really have to think about [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1883.1s)]
*  it after the war is over. Or yeah, we'll let 20,000 Haitians into this small town, but the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1886.94s)]
*  employers will be happy because they'll get some cheap labor and then we won't have to think about [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1893.74s)]
*  it. But when the rural people or the small town people, the working class people start complaining [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1897.42s)]
*  about it, then you have to actually confront whether these things that you have done have [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1902.6200000000001s)]
*  actually made people's lives better. And I think that you sort of confronted with that. So you and [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1907.66s)]
*  I have a mutual friend, I won't use his name, where he was a huge advocate of the war in Iraq. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1913.1s)]
*  And by the way, I was 18 years old, but I also was an advocate of the war in Iraq. I, in fact, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1919.66s)]
*  enlisted in the Marine Corps in April of 2003. We invaded in March of 2003, simplified all the [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1924.0600000000002s)]
*  Marines out there. But so I, but like, okay, the war turned into a total disaster. A lot of young [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1929.98s)]
*  Americans got killed, a lot of innocent people got killed. And I like, that should cause a thinking [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1939.66s)]
*  person to evaluate, well, what were the like processes in my brain that led me to think that [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1944.7s)]
*  this was a good idea and how can I change so that I don't get it wrong the next time? And I think [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1950.54s)]
*  we have a lot of friends who got it wrong, but they can't have that conversation with themselves [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1955.42s)]
*  because it's like too morally challenging. Like they wouldn't be able to look themselves in the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1962.06s)]
*  mirror if they realized, oh, I did this thing that led to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1966.06s)]
*  of innocent people losing their lives. And so you could either do that thing. You could [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1971.66s)]
*  either reevaluate and say, maybe I screwed up. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I should rethink how [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1976.46s)]
*  I understand the world. Like maybe Donald Trump isn't a threat to democracy. Maybe the person [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1981.02s)]
*  who's a threat to democracy is Kamala Harris, who is running for president without a single vote. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1984.8600000000001s)]
*  But you, you, you can, [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1989.9s)]
*  you can say to yourself, oh, I screwed up and I'm going to think about it better. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=1993.5s)]
*  Or you can say the people who are complaining are bad and evil people. And the reason they're [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2003.18s)]
*  complaining is not because I screwed up, but because they are screwed up people. And I think [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2008.94s)]
*  that's what I genuinely think that's what our leadership does. And I, you know, there are [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2013.42s)]
*  people there are people who were legitimately friends of mine, who I think legitimately hate, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2017.98s)]
*  hate the community that I came from because the community that I came from refuses to say, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2023.42s)]
*  oh yeah, we're really glad that based on patriotic sentiment, we, we volunteered at record levels to [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2028.6200000000001s)]
*  enlist in the Marine Corps, the army, the Navy and the air force. And then you sent us off to a [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2035.18s)]
*  really stupid war or we really love that you used to be able to go and raise a family on a single [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2039.34s)]
*  middle class manufacturing income. But now that's really hard to do because of Kamala Harris's [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2046.3s)]
*  inflation crisis, but also because you guys shipped all the jobs to China, right? The people [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2051.98s)]
*  who refuse to say, thank you for making my life miserable are, they, they, they represent a, [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2056.62s)]
*  an opposition and a rebellion against our failed leadership class. And if our leadership class was [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2065.34s)]
*  healthy, they would say, oh, we must have screwed up. But because they can't do that, they decided [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2071.2599999999998s)]
*  to hate the people of their own country. A lot of people seem to have been reaching the same [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2075.34s)]
*  conclusion recently, which is that being a little healthier, being spiritually grounded, eating right, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2079.1800000000003s)]
*  paying attention to nature, all of those really matter. Sleep takes up a big portion of your day, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2084.6200000000003s)]
*  like one third of your life is spent asleep and sleeping well makes you much happier and more [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2089.9s)]
*  productive. So you shouldn't be surprised that some of the products that we've been looking at [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2095.26s)]
*  to think about entering into partnerships with are based on sleep. And we've got one we really like. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2099.26s)]
*  It's called Cozy Earth. Cozy Earth makes among other things, bamboo sheets, bamboo sheets. Well, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2105.58s)]
*  we tried them and they're awesome. Bamboo sheets are really soft and breathable and they keep you [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2111.6600000000003s)]
*  cool all night long and they get even softer with every wash. You got to try it. And they don't just [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2117.26s)]
*  make sheets. They do pajamas and robes, leisure wear, bath towels, make a whole bunch of stuff [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2122.38s)]
*  out of bamboo. And it's cool. It's not just this weird, oh, it's bamboo. Actually, it's great. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2127.1000000000004s)]
*  Try it. They make great gifts. At Cozy Earth, the quality is backed up by a 10-year warranty. They [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2133.4199999999996s)]
*  offer even a 100-night sleep trial, 100 nights. Hmm, didn't take us 100 nights to get into it, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2139.5s)]
*  but try it for yourself. So make your life more comfortable. Head over to CozyEarth.com [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2147.02s)]
*  slash Tucker and use the promo code Tucker for up to 40% off. You will feel the difference. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2151.58s)]
*  CozyEarth.com slash Tucker and use the promo code Tucker for a big discount. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2156.7s)]
*  I'm glad this is on tape because I, this is not flattering. I mean it. I've been interviewing [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2164.62s)]
*  politicians for over 30 years and I can't remember ever hearing an analysis that deep and true from [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2168.7s)]
*  any of them. And I'm also struck by the fact that I know most of the Republicans in the Senate, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2174.22s)]
*  maybe one or two exceptions, I can't imagine any of them saying 90% of what you just said. And yet [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2180.22s)]
*  you were on the ticket with Donald Trump. So that makes me think that the Republican Party [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2185.26s)]
*  is actually changing this time. Do you think that's true? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2190.46s)]
*  I mean, I, so I absolutely do. And I think there's always going to be this kind of effort from the [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2200.86s)]
*  old guard establishment to try to return us to the old ways, the old broken ways. So it's not like a [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2207.42s)]
*  war that's totally over, but I do think that we're currently winning. And look, I have to give [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2212.62s)]
*  a ton of credit to my running mate, the guy at the top of the ticket, Donald J. Trump, because [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2217.74s)]
*  I, and you know this and probably a lot of you in the audience know this, like I was a Trump critic [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2223.3399999999997s)]
*  back in 2016. And it's funny when all of these, when Biden was still running and all of these [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2233.5s)]
*  journalists trying to like confuse how obviously unfit Biden was to serve in the Oval Office, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2239.82s)]
*  they'd be like, well, Biden's really old, but you know, Trump isn't a spring chicken anymore either. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2245.34s)]
*  And when people would say that, I'd be like, guys, Donald Trump remembers a tweet that I sent [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2250.54s)]
*  on September 3rd, 2015. He remembers the time and he remembers exactly what I said to the word. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2256.78s)]
*  Like this guy's memory is as sharp as a tack. In fact, I wish that it wasn't because my life [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2266.3s)]
*  would be a lot easier, but this is, these are not two 70 year old people who are running for president [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2270.2200000000003s)]
*  who are in the same mental condition. One clearly has the energy to do the job and one clearly [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2276.38s)]
*  doesn't. And what, but I mean, I've seen this now having been in the belly of the beast for all of [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2280.78s)]
*  two years, but I really wish that I had been on board earlier because what Trump dealt with [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2291.18s)]
*  in 2016, it cannot be overstated. And I'm talking about like friends of yours, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2298.46s)]
*  people he had been friends with for 30 years, calling him and attacking him or going on [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2306.54s)]
*  national television and lying about him. When you challenge this ossified broken [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2311.4199999999996s)]
*  ruling class in this country, there is hell to pay for it. And I've got just a little bit of the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2318.54s)]
*  taste of it. I think Donald Trump has gotten a hundred times worse than I have. And obviously, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2323.58s)]
*  he almost got literally killed just seven weeks ago. And then again, like three days ago, but [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2327.82s)]
*  Trump, if he hadn't won the primary and if he hadn't won the general election, the Republican [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2333.98s)]
*  party would be broken. He fixed it and actually created an opportunity for us to build something [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2339.2599999999998s)]
*  that's durable and it can work for the long haul. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2345.1s)]
*  And I think, you know, so I was just, I think it was his first endorser in the United States Senate [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2353.66s)]
*  and like all of my political advisors are like, why are you doing this? It's way too early in the [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2358.38s)]
*  primary. And it's because having not been on board in 2016, I realized that the 2024 primary would [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2361.66s)]
*  really be this sort of fundamentally, no matter who challenged him, and there were a lot of good [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2369.5s)]
*  people fundamentally that challenged him. It would ultimately come down to the old guard [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2374.7s)]
*  versus the pro worker, pro America party. And I just knew that's how the dividing lines would [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2381.4199999999996s)]
*  ultimately shake out because the old guard, because a lot of them knew Donald Trump in business, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2387.2599999999998s)]
*  because a lot of them know that he knows what they're up to. They hate him more than almost [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2392.54s)]
*  anybody. And they hate him because he does actually fight for the American people. And he does [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2398.7799999999997s)]
*  actually care about the citizens of his own country. And you can look, one thing, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2403.02s)]
*  one thing I'll say about president Trump that is genuinely unique is look, he obviously is [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2409.2599999999998s)]
*  incredibly successful and incredibly wealthy. Like I'm never, never, nobody's going to pretend [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2415.74s)]
*  that Donald Trump is a working class person, at least now in his life. But Trump actually [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2419.18s)]
*  really likes the people that he leads. And that includes, by the way, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2426.46s)]
*  that includes, by the way, the people who didn't vote for him. He still really likes those people. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2434.06s)]
*  And that is, I think what is very different about president Trump versus frankly, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2439.1800000000003s)]
*  most of America's leadership is when the cameras are off and they don't think anybody's listening, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2443.26s)]
*  they talk about how much they think their own citizens are dumb or, well, yeah, the public [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2448.94s)]
*  thinks this because the public doesn't understand economics. Or, well, if the public was just [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2454.3s)]
*  smarter, they would realize how smart are Kamala Harris is for wanting to destroy social security [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2458.7000000000003s)]
*  and Medicare for illegal immigration. They actually think that their own people are stupid [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2465.82s)]
*  and they don't like them. But Donald Trump actually likes people. And I think it's one [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2471.1000000000004s)]
*  of the secrets to success as a political candidate. Watching him order at McDonald's is one of the [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2474.6200000000003s)]
*  most amazing things ever. It's hysterical. It's impossible to imagine Kamala, whatever [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2480.14s)]
*  she's calling herself, Harris. Talk to the lady behind the counter about the differences [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2485.98s)]
*  in quality and weight and price between the quarter pounder and the Big Mac. And he has [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2493.42s)]
*  such strong feelings about it. I mean, he's really thought about it a lot. Well, and again, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2497.5s)]
*  this goes to his leadership style. Donald Trump actually really cares of what people think. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2502.3799999999997s)]
*  So he is absolutely thought to himself, what is the better value between the quarter pounder [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2508.14s)]
*  and the Big Mac? And he actually wants to know what the people who work there think about this [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2514.46s)]
*  question. And by the way, I have very strong views about this. Obviously, the quarter pounder is a [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2521.3399999999997s)]
*  better deal. Right? That's absurd. Without secret sauce, it's not even worth going there. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2525.18s)]
*  Whatever. I mean, you know, honest people disagree. Marlboro Winston, I get it. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2531.98s)]
*  You've allowed yourself to be manipulated by the elites. The secret sauce is not the thing that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2535.18s)]
*  matters. It's the amount of meat. You get way more meat with the quarter pounder. And it's [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2540.14s)]
*  obviously, again, but look, the point is, okay, so let me give you an example of this. So the [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2544.94s)]
*  Saturday morning that President Trump was shot, I don't know if I've ever talked about this publicly, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2554.06s)]
*  but I was down in Mar-a-Lago for the first time talking about becoming his vice presidential [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2558.86s)]
*  nominee. And it was kind of these crazy things. All these reporters would stick microphones in my [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2565.7400000000002s)]
*  face and say, you know, you're clearly on the short list. And have you talked to President [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2569.9s)]
*  Trump about it? And I'd say, no, I haven't. In fact, I don't even know if I'm actually on the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2573.58s)]
*  short list because I've never spoken with him. So the Saturday morning I'm in Mar-a-Lago, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2577.02s)]
*  we're talking about the VP thing. And he's like, you know, I like to talk to everybody [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2582.14s)]
*  about who should be the VP. I spent about 30 minutes talking to the gardener at Mar-a-Lago [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2588.7799999999997s)]
*  about who he thought should be the vice presidential nominee. And I'm sitting there, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2592.8599999999997s)]
*  sweating bullets, like, well, sir, what did the gardener at Mar-a-Lago have to say about who [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2598.22s)]
*  should be the VP? Because this is a question that actually really impacts my life. So- [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2603.66s)]
*  Do you know the gardener or is it random? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2607.82s)]
*  No, just random. But again, he actually likes to know what people think about things. That's [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2610.78s)]
*  one of his secrets of success as a political leader. So anyway, he goes to Pennsylvania. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2614.78s)]
*  He doesn't tell me that it's me. He says, it's probably going to be you. I'm like, oh, thanks. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2620.94s)]
*  That makes me feel great. I'm totally going to sleep great tonight knowing it's probably going [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2625.9s)]
*  to be me. He flies to Bucks County, Pennsylvania, of course, is nearly assassinated. God bless you [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2630.86s)]
*  guys. And then he makes the decision, I think, the next day or maybe even Monday morning. I don't [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2637.1s)]
*  know. I don't know when he actually finally made the decision. Probably was just Monday morning, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2644.94s)]
*  now that I think about it. You probably know better than I do. Anyway, the point is, again, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2649.42s)]
*  I actually think that if you care about the people that you represent and the people that you lead, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2657.58s)]
*  you should want to know what they think about an issue. And whatever disagreements you might have [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2663.42s)]
*  with President Trump, he genuinely cares about what people think about an issue. And it's why [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2667.9s)]
*  I think he's better plugged into what the electorate thinks than most political candidates. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2673.1s)]
*  I think that's right. The switch up, the disappearance of the president of the United [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2676.86s)]
*  States, Biden is still president, technically, correct? I don't know. I don't either. And [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2685.34s)]
*  right. I really don't know. I don't know what happened to him. He was like pretty famous at [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2689.1s)]
*  one point and then he's just gone. I saw some clip on social media that like Jill Biden was [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2692.22s)]
*  running a cabinet meeting. Was that real or was that- [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2697.66s)]
*  For sure. She's a doctor, JD. Settle down. She's got this. And anyone who hasn't read her [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2700.54s)]
*  dissertation on community colleges in the state of Delaware really should see where the doctor [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2708.14s)]
*  comes from. She literally is a part of it where she's breaking down the proportion of bi-ethnicity [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2712.4599999999996s)]
*  of students and she's like, it's about 40% Caucasian, about 37% African-American. It's [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2716.22s)]
*  another 39% Hispanic and then another 22% Asian. And I'm like, I'm not good at math, but- [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2722.14s)]
*  Wait a second. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2727.8199999999997s)]
*  You should read Dr. Jill's dissertation. It's unbelievable. Anyway, she's running the government, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2729.74s)]
*  just so you know. I don't think that adds up to 100. I'm no genius. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2735.98s)]
*  No, it does look like 147 actually, but whatever. She's a doctor. But here's my question. And I [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2738.4599999999996s)]
*  don't mean to finger the media in this. Sorry. I'm sorry. I spent my life in a newsroom. It's [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2744.06s)]
*  vulgar. I know. Kamala Harris went from being like, regardless of a buffoon by everybody, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2751.02s)]
*  including every Democrat I know, you're constantly reading about only Montel Williams likes or [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2759.02s)]
*  whatever. Everyone made fun of her. And then like within 24 hours, she's this historic statesman [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2764.94s)]
*  how was the media able to pull that off? Honestly? Yeah. I mean, a lot of shamelessness. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2774.06s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that we say on the campaign trail, because it's true, is that we [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2781.42s)]
*  do a lot of interviews. Like me and President Trump do a ton of interviews with hostile media, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2787.82s)]
*  with friendly media, with everybody in the middle. And Kamala Harris doesn't. Now, part of the [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2791.2599999999998s)]
*  argument that we're trying to make is, to the American people, you shouldn't trust a person [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2795.42s)]
*  who's so terrified of the media that she runs away from them. You can't trust that person [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2800.06s)]
*  in a private meeting with Xi Jinping. But part of what we've been trying to do too, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2805.9s)]
*  is actually shame the American media, which is totally like, it's total historical revisionism [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2814.2999999999997s)]
*  right before our eyes. I mean, my wife even, who's a totally apolitical person, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2821.58s)]
*  but right after they did the Kamala switcheroo, she sent me like a bunch of clips [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2827.26s)]
*  of different people and how they spoke about Kamala Harris like three months ago, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2832.38s)]
*  and how they speak about Kamala Harris today. And it's totally flipped. And we've been trying to [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2837.1000000000004s)]
*  shame the American media into looking themselves in the mirror and asking her some tough questions [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2842.38s)]
*  and actually reporting on a record. And you know what we've learned, Tucker? The American media [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2847.0200000000004s)]
*  has no shame. And- So like, I mean, they're here, right? I can feel their filthy presence. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2850.62s)]
*  I can see some of their- I can feel it. But today, like, you run into them on the road, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2857.5s)]
*  what do they say? Well, they'll say in private, almost all of them will say, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2861.58s)]
*  yeah, it's really ridiculous. Or in public, they'll say, well, you know, we hope that she'll give us [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2866.2999999999997s)]
*  an interview. And it's like, well, but the democratic process requires that she gives you [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2871.1s)]
*  an interview before people start voting. Like your job, if you have any job, and by the way, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2876.3s)]
*  to the reporters out there, I know some of you are out there, like your job is to not repeat [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2881.1000000000004s)]
*  Kamala Harris' propaganda without at least getting a chance to ask her a question about it. And that's [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2885.9s)]
*  what- Well, but it's really simple. I've been in the media my whole life. I know how it works. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2891.6600000000003s)]
*  If you want a politician to do something, you attack that politician until the politician does [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2899.1000000000004s)]
*  what you want. And so they could make Kamala Harris give interviews to everybody from TMZ, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2904.94s)]
*  the Washington Post editorial page, just by attacking her every day, but they won't. Why? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2912.14s)]
*  Well, because unfortunately, most of the American media, we need to be honest about this, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2917.26s)]
*  most of the American media is in fact part of the very corrupt system that they pretend to report on. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2922.54s)]
*  Right? That's the answer. So, okay. So if you're, I mean, first of all, the news media business [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2928.06s)]
*  has been totally decimated by big tech, by the way. Like the reason why we don't really have [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2938.46s)]
*  local papers anymore is in a 20 year period, all of the advertising revenue that used to go [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2942.86s)]
*  like classified ads in local papers now goes through Google and Facebook, so forth. So if [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2948.3s)]
*  you're a journalist, there's a very good chance that your paycheck fundamentally depends on the [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2954.62s)]
*  people who are getting rich off of the system. Now, that doesn't mean, by the way, and I know [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2959.58s)]
*  a lot of them and I actually like them personally. It's one of my many faults is I like journalists [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2964.06s)]
*  personally, but the thing that they will say is they really believe the things that they're [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2967.74s)]
*  reporting and they really believe that what they're saying and what they're doing is the truth. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2973.66s)]
*  And they're right about that, by the way. I don't think that most of them are liars. I think most [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2977.66s)]
*  of them are just deluded, no offense, guys. But if they weren't deluded and if there was somebody [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2981.42s)]
*  who was actually really asking, well, why are we spending so much time attacking Donald Trump? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2987.7400000000002s)]
*  Because he dared to bring up the Haitian migrant problem in Springfield. And instead, why are we [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=2994.38s)]
*  spending so much time attacking him instead of, I don't know, investigating any of the numerous [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3001.5s)]
*  issues that Kamala Harris has flip-flopped on in just the last three years? If there was a reporter [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3007.42s)]
*  who wanted to do that, they would not last long in those media organizations. So there's a basic [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3012.2200000000003s)]
*  selection bias. If you're a person who can honestly look at American society and say, oh, wait a [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3017.58s)]
*  second, American life expectancy is declining, right? The only industrialized country in the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3022.86s)]
*  world where that's true. We continue to be more and more reliant on some of our biggest international [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3028.78s)]
*  adversaries to make the things that we need. And we're sleepwalking into a multi-continent, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3034.54s)]
*  in other words, a World War with a president who clearly doesn't even know who the hell or where [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3039.9s)]
*  the hell he is. Maybe the honest thing would be to really aggressively interrogate how we got here. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3045.34s)]
*  But no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What the journalists have instead decided to do is they're [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3052.54s)]
*  They're gonna focus on like a sex scandal from two days ago from like that involves [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3058.14s)]
*  some random journalists who I don't even know I've never even met. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3064.62s)]
*  Right? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3067.74s)]
*  There's like this weird sex scandal story going on right now. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3068.74s)]
*  The media is obsessed with. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3070.54s)]
*  They're not. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3072.02s)]
*  I don't think there was any actual sex in the sex scandal. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3073.02s)]
*  That's how I started it. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3074.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3075.7799999999997s)]
*  But, but, but the media is more focused on that than they are on the fact that we are [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3076.7799999999997s)]
*  sleepwalking into World War Three with Joe Biden as the president of the United States. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3082.3399999999997s)]
*  And the reason why we have Joe Biden is because Kamala Harris lied about his mental fitness [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3087.38s)]
*  for office. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3092.42s)]
*  Like, if you actually care about the truth, ask those questions and leave the salacious [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3093.42s)]
*  bullshit to the tabloids. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3098.78s)]
*  But they can't do that. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3100.58s)]
*  And if they did Tucker, again, if they did, a lot of them would lose their jobs. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3102.86s)]
*  And so it selects for people who are very trusting of the system and not for people [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3109.84s)]
*  who actually want to ask questions of that system. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3115.46s)]
*  The most interesting and newsworthy television show of the year is coming here to TCN. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3117.7000000000003s)]
*  We are not bragging. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3123.34s)]
*  That's actually true. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3124.7400000000002s)]
*  The president's been shot. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3125.7400000000002s)]
*  I repeat, the president's been shot. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3126.7400000000002s)]
*  So our longtime producer, Justin Wells and a team have been embedded with no publicity [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3129.7400000000002s)]
*  at all with Donald Trump on the campaign trail for months. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3135.2200000000003s)]
*  They're the only crew capturing what is going on on the campaign in real time, intimately. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3139.06s)]
*  They're with Trump as he campaigns for the presidency across the country. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3145.62s)]
*  And they've shot some amazing footage that shows you what it's really like in there. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3148.9399999999996s)]
*  So if you're a member, you will soon be able to get this docu-series covering the historic [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3152.74s)]
*  campaign, the fall of Joe Biden, never before seen footage from the assassination attempt [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3156.9399999999996s)]
*  at the Butler Township, Pennsylvania Trump rally, and a lot more. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3161.22s)]
*  It's going to pull back the curtain completely. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3164.54s)]
*  They are embedded inside the campaign. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3166.34s)]
*  I can't wait to see it personally. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3168.94s)]
*  But to get it first, go to TuckerCarlson.com, become a member of the greatest television [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3170.82s)]
*  event of the year. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3175.9s)]
*  We're proud to offer it. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3176.9s)]
*  It's just wild that one of the things that they've been able to ignore completely is [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3185.9s)]
*  the number of politically motivated prosecutions over the last four years. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3190.3s)]
*  I think the congressman from this district, actually, Scott Perry, got hassled by the [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3194.3s)]
*  FBI. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3197.06s)]
*  I think I may be missing this. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3198.06s)]
*  And I think Scott Perry is here, by the way. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3199.06s)]
*  Great congressman, Scott, if you're out there. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3200.94s)]
*  Oh, he is? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3201.94s)]
*  He's a great guy. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3202.94s)]
*  Hello? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3203.94s)]
*  Hassled by the FBI for asking, this is my read, not his, but asking questions about [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3204.94s)]
*  the last election. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3208.26s)]
*  That's not a criminal offense. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3209.26s)]
*  I know a bunch of people who are in jail right now. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3210.26s)]
*  Right now, for political reasons in our country that's never really reported on. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3212.2200000000003s)]
*  It's bizarre. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3217.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess the question is, if you guys lose, what would stop that from just becoming universal? [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3219.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3227.22s)]
*  Well, I don't know that anything would. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3228.5s)]
*  Because the animating bias, the animating motivation, I should say, of Kamala Harris's [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3232.34s)]
*  Democratic Party is censorship. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3239.46s)]
*  Because without censorship, you can't get all of the other things that they want. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3242.58s)]
*  You can't get the ridiculous foreign policy or the ridiculous trade policy, the wide open [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3245.58s)]
*  borders without censorship. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3250.3199999999997s)]
*  And so if you look, and this is, by the way, I think this is actually the fundamental difference [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3252.1s)]
*  between the overheated political rhetoric on the left and on the right. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3256.34s)]
*  And I hate, by the way, when people both sides this issue, they're like, well, we all need [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3260.7999999999997s)]
*  to tone down the rhetoric. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3264.18s)]
*  Well, look, by the way, I try to be a very humble person. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3265.42s)]
*  I agree, we can all tone down the rhetoric. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3268.7799999999997s)]
*  None of us is perfect, including me. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3270.74s)]
*  But when Donald Trump has taken two assassination attempts in the last seven weeks, it's not [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3273.66s)]
*  both sides that need to tone down the rhetoric. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3277.58s)]
*  It's one side in particular. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3279.74s)]
*  And you have to ask. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3281.74s)]
*  But if you look at what is the animating focus of the political prosecutions, of the big [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3289.46s)]
*  tech censorship in 2020 and all the censorship around COVID, of the fact that the European [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3296.62s)]
*  Union, which basically wouldn't exist without American taxpayer protection. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3302.34s)]
*  I mean, Europe, like only two countries in Europe even have real militaries at this point. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3306.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3312.1000000000004s)]
*  NATO is at this point a welfare client of the United States of America. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3313.1000000000004s)]
*  So Europe is going after Elon Musk for free speech and threatening to imprison him for [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3316.86s)]
*  platforming who? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3323.78s)]
*  Donald Trump, who is the likely next president of the United States. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3325.58s)]
*  You go down the list, the animating bias is censorship. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3329.42s)]
*  And if you think about it, what is the ultimate way? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3333.94s)]
*  If you've tried to bankrupt a person, you've tried to jail a person, you've tried to throw [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3336.98s)]
*  a person in prison, you've tried to kick them out of office, you've impeached them twice. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3341.7200000000003s)]
*  What is the ultimate way to censor a human being? [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3346.8s)]
*  Taking their life. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3350.42s)]
*  And I think this is really the difference between political rhetoric on the left and [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3351.7200000000003s)]
*  we don't always get it right on my side of the aisle, but we're never saying we want [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3356.58s)]
*  to censor the other side. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3361.18s)]
*  We in fact want to have the debate. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3362.8599999999997s)]
*  We're telling Kamala Harris, you should do more interviews, not less. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3364.3399999999997s)]
*  You should get out there more because we get about a hundred thousand votes every time [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3367.9799999999996s)]
*  you open your mouth. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3370.66s)]
*  Wait, but all kidding aside, we are not trying to censor the left. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3371.78s)]
*  The left is trying to censor not just the right, but the entire country, which goes [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3387.7400000000002s)]
*  to show they are a threat to democracy. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3392.48s)]
*  They cannot be rewarded with more political power. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3396.38s)]
*  They have to be penalized. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3398.7400000000002s)]
*  As I've learned as a young father, when a kid screws up and you just let them, you reward [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3400.7s)]
*  them for it, they actually do it more and they do it worse. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3407.3399999999997s)]
*  The only way to reward Kamala Harris is by making her president and the only way to punish [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3410.9799999999996s)]
*  her and say, look, we don't accept censorship of our fellow citizens is to fire her and [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3416.3599999999997s)]
*  send her back to San Francisco. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3421.5s)]
*  That's where she belongs. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3422.8599999999997s)]
*  So given that, I mean, every news outlet I've ever worked at, which is a lot of them, they're [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3423.86s)]
*  all controlled, obviously. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3433.7000000000003s)]
*  And given that, you know, the biggest tech platforms would be Google and YouTube, same [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3436.7000000000003s)]
*  company, openly practice censorship, all kinds of things you can't talk about, they'll take [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3441.26s)]
*  you off, demonetize you. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3444.52s)]
*  Really, we're talking about X, actually. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3445.78s)]
*  We're talking about X is the place where free speech lives. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3447.7000000000003s)]
*  And if you were to take that out, darkness would descend. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3452.26s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3456.86s)]
*  And if you want to know the totalitarian impulses of your ruling class, read the Atlantic magazine [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3457.86s)]
*  where they announced all of it ahead of time. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3461.94s)]
*  And they're telling you now that we need to shut down Elon Musk's X because there's just [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3464.7400000000002s)]
*  way too much free speech. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3468.94s)]
*  And I wonder how seriously you take those threats. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3470.76s)]
*  Well, I take them very seriously. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3472.82s)]
*  I mean, look, if we learned anything over the last four years is when these people say [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3474.42s)]
*  they want to do something, they actually mean it and they intend to do it. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3477.42s)]
*  We actually had to take them seriously. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3481.18s)]
*  When Kamala Harris ran saying that we want to suspend deportations, re-implement catch [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3482.98s)]
*  and release, which is basically just mass asylum fraud, and stop Donald Trump's remain [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3488.2999999999997s)]
*  in Mexico policy, even though I didn't vote for her, I voted for Donald Trump, I thought, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3492.62s)]
*  well, this is crazy. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3496.62s)]
*  They're not actually going to do this. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3497.7s)]
*  And then they did. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3498.94s)]
*  So when they say that they want to use the force of law to silence or even imprison Elon [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3500.2799999999997s)]
*  to host a free speech platform, we have to listen to them. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3507.38s)]
*  And that is the one thing, the most awesome power in the physical world today is the United [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3511.9s)]
*  States government. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3518.2200000000003s)]
*  Millions of people, the world's largest and most powerful military. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3519.78s)]
*  If we give that over to people who are saying not only we disagree with Donald Trump, not [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3523.6600000000003s)]
*  only do we disagree with Donald Trump supporters, but we want to prevent them from participating [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3528.38s)]
*  in the American democratic system. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3532.92s)]
*  That is some scary shit and we need to reject it. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3535.8s)]
*  And that's exactly what I think, by the way, with your help, we're going to do. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3538.52s)]
*  So thank you for doing this. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3543.1200000000003s)]
*  This has been a really interesting and amazing conversation. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3545.0s)]
*  So last question for you. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3548.92s)]
*  So I think if I'm reading this correctly, that Donald Trump has announced that he will [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3550.26s)]
*  not allow states and municipalities going forward, if elected in November, to continue [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3555.1800000000003s)]
*  being so-called sanctuary cities, which means places or entire states in these 50 United [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3560.24s)]
*  States that openly ignore federal immigration law, which must be federal because it applies [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3569.3599999999997s)]
*  to all of us and its effects are national. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3574.2s)]
*  Someone comes into one state and go to your state. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3577.2799999999997s)]
*  And I'm just thinking, reading this like this has been going on for decades. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3579.8799999999997s)]
*  Any state or city that has a sanctuary city law is an open rebellion in the way that for [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3585.04s)]
*  some term was an open rebellion against the government of the United States. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3590.44s)]
*  Why have we allowed this to go on for decades? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3594.76s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3597.0s)]
*  Well, the answer is we've allowed it to go on because the federal government still funds [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3599.0s)]
*  all of these cities. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3603.08s)]
*  They like the sanctuary cities stuff is very expensive because when you invite millions [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3604.08s)]
*  of illegal aliens into your country and then certain cities and municipalities invite thousands [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3609.44s)]
*  or even tens of thousands. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3614.56s)]
*  I mean, the cost to illegal immigration in New York City, I believe is north of $6 billion [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3615.56s)]
*  a year. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3621.2799999999997s)]
*  In Chicago, I think it's around $500 million a year. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3622.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, that money doesn't come from Chicago taxpayers. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3625.7599999999998s)]
*  It primarily comes through federal subsidies. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3628.36s)]
*  So if you want to end sanctuary cities, just cut off the money spigot to sanctuary cities. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3631.44s)]
*  You don't get our taxpayer money if you refuse to enforce the law. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3636.32s)]
*  It's actually this one. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3641.04s)]
*  Some of the stuff is really complicated. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3645.24s)]
*  This one is actually very simple. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3647.1s)]
*  The federal government just needs to say, we control immigration law. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3648.86s)]
*  There's some things the states and local governments control. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3653.48s)]
*  The federal government controls like foreign policy, immigration law, and a few other things. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3655.86s)]
*  And if you are not going to obey federal immigration laws, then we're going to cut off the paycheck. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3660.48s)]
*  We're going to cut off the money and you have to enforce our laws in order to get any more [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3667.04s)]
*  money from American taxpayers. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3670.96s)]
*  Well, but I know, but like when when Central High School disobeyed federal law in Little [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3671.96s)]
*  Rock in 1956, they set the 101st airborne. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3676.36s)]
*  And I just, this has been going on where states and cities are like, we basically are our [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3679.7200000000003s)]
*  own countries now and no one's done anything. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3685.52s)]
*  Can you just really quick tell us the mindset that allowed Washington to ignore this? [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3688.28s)]
*  Oh, well, I don't think it's that Washington's ignoring it, Tucker. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3693.52s)]
*  I think that it actually shows where the real power is and that's with the federal [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3696.36s)]
*  bureaucracy and our, you know, our mutual friend Vivek Ramaswamy talks a lot about this, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3700.48s)]
*  that the real, and again, like you hear this term threat to democracy, it's always projection. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3704.6800000000003s)]
*  When they talk about threats to democracy, they're always projecting on something else. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3713.84s)]
*  Like the real threat to democracy, you and I have talked about this, is if the president [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3717.1200000000003s)]
*  States orders generals to do a troop redeployment and the generals refuse or lie to the president [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3722.28s)]
*  about what they've done, like that's a threat to democracy. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3727.92s)]
*  And by the way, that happened at the very end of Donald Trump's presidency, right? [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3730.5600000000004s)]
*  And none of those people got fired. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3734.0s)]
*  None of them were even punished. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3735.8s)]
*  So you ask about immigration in sanctuary cities. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3736.8s)]
*  The answer to this question is the permanent bureaucracy in Washington doesn't want us [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3739.82s)]
*  to have a border. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3744.84s)]
*  So even when you have a guy like Donald Trump who is using all of the powers of the presidency [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3746.0400000000004s)]
*  to try to enforce the southern border, like the bureaucrats have to listen to him on that [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3751.12s)]
*  issue because they report to him, but they can make it easier for the state and municipalities [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3755.48s)]
*  to violate immigration law. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3761.44s)]
*  And that's how they subvert the will of the American people's elected president. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3763.7s)]
*  I mean, this, this is like a fundamental question. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3767.3599999999997s)]
*  Ask yourself who amongst the United States of America, which citizens voted to have 25 [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3770.48s)]
*  illegal aliens invade this country? [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3778.56s)]
*  Like not, not, I don't think anyone, even, even Democrats who disagree with me about [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3782.08s)]
*  exactly what to do with the illegal immigrants who are here. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3787.08s)]
*  I don't think that they voted for a literal invasion of this country. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3789.96s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3794.4s)]
*  You talk about inflation and all the unaffordability problems. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3795.4s)]
*  Who voted to, in the name of environmental cleanliness, to shut down American energy [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3798.6s)]
*  and ship it to China, which is the dirtiest economy in the entire world. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3806.0800000000004s)]
*  Nobody voted for that. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3810.1200000000003s)]
*  So what these guys do abetted by the media is they run on slogans. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3811.6000000000004s)]
*  The media covers up for it. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3816.2400000000002s)]
*  They pretend that those slogans have substance. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3817.7200000000003s)]
*  And then even when the American people see through the BS and elect a guy like Donald [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3819.7200000000003s)]
*  Trump, the permanent bureaucracy fights him every step of the way. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3823.88s)]
*  One of the most important things Tucker that we are going to do when we win is that we [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3827.1600000000003s)]
*  are going to make the bureaucracy responsive to the American people. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3831.7200000000003s)]
*  It has to happen. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3835.28s)]
*  If you don't do that, you don't have a real constitutional. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3836.6400000000003s)]
*  I mean, you're really going to need to be tough to get that done. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3840.0400000000004s)]
*  Are you confident you can do that? [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3843.96s)]
*  Tucker, I'm confident we can do it because nobody has ever really tried because for 40 [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3846.1600000000003s)]
*  years, we haven't had a real political opposition in this country. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3851.0800000000004s)]
*  And now we do think about, I mean, just, just take the three basic issues that we talked [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3854.42s)]
*  about trade policy, immigration policy, foreign policy. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3860.0s)]
*  There are disagreements even within the Republican Party about those issues, but every single [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3863.24s)]
*  one of those issues are winning issues with the American people. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3868.24s)]
*  So what we're saying is crazy as it sounds, we think the American people should have a [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3872.24s)]
*  government that reflects their best interests and their actual preferences. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3878.08s)]
*  And we're going to fight every single day to make it happen. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3882.68s)]
*  And there's no reason to do this. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3885.1s)]
*  Hey, look, as you know, my life was like very easy before I ran for political office and [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3887.16s)]
*  Donald Trump's was way easier than mine. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3893.44s)]
*  We're only doing this because we think that we can get it done. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3896.2400000000002s)]
*  We have to get it done to save the country. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3898.88s)]
*  So I just want to stop by repeating something you just said. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3903.12s)]
*  For 40 years, we haven't had an opposition party. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3906.84s)]
*  And now we do. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3911.44s)]
*  God bless you. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3912.7200000000003s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA0RCxBALCo&t=3915.6800000000003s)]
