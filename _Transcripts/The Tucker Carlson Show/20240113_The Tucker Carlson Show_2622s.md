# Be Prepared. The Grid Is Going Down.
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g)
*  Dennis Quaid is one of the most famous actors in the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=0.0s)]
*  He's been in about 150 movies, spanning almost 50 years. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=3.2s)]
*  And he is, at the same time, a really interesting and engaged [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=7.12s)]
*  person with a lot to say who thinks a lot and thinks freely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=9.72s)]
*  He's also an accomplished musician. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  But he has a project coming up that you probably [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  ought to know about. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  We thought it was definitely worth telling you about. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=19.32s)]
*  And so we're grateful that Dennis Quaid is joining us [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=21.44s)]
*  on set right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=23.2s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=25.16s)]
*  I'm so glad to be here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=25.96s)]
*  So I mean, I could ask you a million questions. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  But I want to get right to the project that's [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=29.48s)]
*  coming up right now about our power grid that you did. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=32.24s)]
*  Can you just give us a quick overview of what this is [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=36.4s)]
*  and why did you do it? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  It's called Grid Down, Power Up. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=39.64s)]
*  And it's about an issue which concerned me really [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  for quite some time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=45.72s)]
*  They did a little segment on 60 Minutes about this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  But basically, there is a 100% probability [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=50.88s)]
*  that our sun generating what they call a GMD, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=56.4s)]
*  which is a solar storm, that hits our earth [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  and the magnetic field that we have around the earth [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=66.8s)]
*  and can fry everything that is electric above the ground, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=70.2s)]
*  including our entire grid. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  And this would happen organically naturally? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=76.56s)]
*  That's just what the sun does? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=79.0s)]
*  It has happened. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  There was a, they call it a Carrington event, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=80.84s)]
*  which happened in, I think it was 1859. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=84.2s)]
*  And at that time, basically, we had telegraph lines, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=87.36s)]
*  as far as electricity goes. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=91.24s)]
*  And it fried our entire telegraph system. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  It was set up, had to be replaced. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=98.2s)]
*  And the entire thing? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  The entire thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=102.08s)]
*  And so imagine what that would do now [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=103.32s)]
*  with a very large storm, which there's [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=107.36s)]
*  a 100% chance of it happening. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  That was a 100 year event, they call that one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=113.4s)]
*  And I'm not gonna map, but 1859. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=116.68s)]
*  Trillions of dollars that it would take [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=118.88s)]
*  to replace all that, plus there wouldn't, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=120.56s)]
*  we wouldn't even get to spend those trillions of dollars [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=124.96s)]
*  because it would take out not only the electricity, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=128.2s)]
*  but all of our entire infrastructure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=133.2s)]
*  and our society runs our electricity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=135.84s)]
*  We don't know how to live without it. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=138.72s)]
*  You know, you turn on, there wouldn't be any water [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  in your tap, there wouldn't. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  You couldn't get gas for your car [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=145.56s)]
*  because the whole system is broken down. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=147.24s)]
*  Everything that we rely upon would be gone. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  The food would melt in our refrigerators. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=155.12s)]
*  There would be, and they predict within a year, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=157.8s)]
*  about 90% of the population would be dead [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  from starvation, disease, or you know, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=165.12s)]
*  people, it gets back to the Stone Age again. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=168.76s)]
*  Killing each other. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=172.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=173.6s)]
*  Well that's shocking. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=175.28s)]
*  Yeah, so. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=176.48s)]
*  Bit of information. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=177.3s)]
*  It really lifts your day, doesn't it? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=178.14s)]
*  It does. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=179.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm adding that to the Armageddon file [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=181.0s)]
*  that's growing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=183.48s)]
*  Nobody's really talking about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=184.32s)]
*  And in fact, President Trump actually signed [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=186.76s)]
*  an executive order to harden our grid [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=192.0s)]
*  to protect ourselves against an event like this happening. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=197.32s)]
*  Obama tried to get that going as well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=200.66s)]
*  And it stuck in these regulatory agencies [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=203.96s)]
*  and lobbyists, because money needs to be spent. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=211.12s)]
*  Most of our grid power companies are privately owned [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=214.8s)]
*  and you can understand them not wanting to spend money [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=218.48s)]
*  on something that might occur. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=221.36s)]
*  But this is definitely going to occur. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=223.56s)]
*  And so it would mean, and this is not [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=226.16s)]
*  from a foreign adversary. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=229.04s)]
*  This is just a solar cycle or something that happened. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=230.16s)]
*  Well, we'll get to that in a minute. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay, but this is, but we're starting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=234.04s)]
*  with just what nature might do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=235.6s)]
*  Yeah, this is not what you call an enemy. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=236.76s)]
*  This is, you know, the sun that we rely upon every day [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=238.68s)]
*  and these solar storms that happen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=243.88s)]
*  And they happen with, you know, frequency. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=246.08s)]
*  And you've seen, everybody's seen, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=250.20000000000002s)]
*  pictures of the sun where the storm is happening [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  and you see these flares come out [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=256.24s)]
*  and they're ejected out into the solar system. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=257.08s)]
*  And we just, you know, like in packets. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=261.08s)]
*  And we, I think it was 2014, we barely missed one [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=264.96s)]
*  by five days that went across our path [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=270.24s)]
*  of orbit around the sun. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=275.26s)]
*  And it's going to happen. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=277.48s)]
*  And then, you know, once it hits the earth, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=280.08s)]
*  there's a 50% probability of it either being us [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=281.92s)]
*  or the eastern hemisphere, who's ever exposed to the sun. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  So is there anything that you can do? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=295.56s)]
*  I mean, could you harden our electrical? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=298.22s)]
*  Yes, there are simple things that we could actually do. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=300.92s)]
*  To, that could be built in that would, you know, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=306.36s)]
*  not only for the military, which we'll get to, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=310.8s)]
*  but civilian infrastructure to protect it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=313.12s)]
*  That relatively inexpensive compared to what it would cost [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=318.68s)]
*  if an event like this happened. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=324.3s)]
*  And overall, over time, it'd probably be [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=327.64s)]
*  about $100 billion, about the same [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=331.76s)]
*  that we just gave to Ukraine. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=334.4s)]
*  Right, so. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=337.26s)]
*  To protect them from the Russians. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=339.1s)]
*  And it'd be money spent. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=342.34000000000003s)]
*  Plus also, the process of doing this, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=344.42s)]
*  it's like a space program. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=350.90000000000003s)]
*  You find out all kinds of other things [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=351.98s)]
*  that actually help society and advance us in our technology. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  But basically relays, protective relays [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=360.32s)]
*  that could be put at our substations and transformers [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=365.44s)]
*  that an event like this happens, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=369.28s)]
*  kind of similar to kind of a surge protector [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=372.08s)]
*  that you have in your computer. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=374.28s)]
*  That since that, you know, there's a surge like that [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=375.96s)]
*  and cut it off to protect it frying our transformers. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=379.0s)]
*  Would, and pardon my total ignorance on this topic, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=386.12s)]
*  I'm embarrassed, but would such a solar storm hurt people [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=388.72s)]
*  or just electrical components? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=392.68s)]
*  No, it doesn't hurt people. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=394.0s)]
*  It's only like the transistors and anything electrical. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=398.44s)]
*  And you can melt it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=404.92s)]
*  These transformers that we have, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=407.48s)]
*  I think there's, there's, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=411.04s)]
*  you remember the blackout that happened in New York [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=414.96s)]
*  not too long ago, that it took, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=418.68s)]
*  it was trees that were hanging over a power line [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=422.2s)]
*  just like that, which caused a surge of power [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=426.2s)]
*  and upset the balance. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=428.96s)]
*  And it all relies on these transformers [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=430.76s)]
*  that get overheated. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=432.92s)]
*  And they, if you need to replace one, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=436.52s)]
*  you don't just replace one, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=439.28s)]
*  they weigh about 500,000 pounds to begin with to get them. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=440.52s)]
*  It takes, if you want another one, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=444.64s)]
*  it takes two years to get one. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=446.56s)]
*  We just don't have them sitting around [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  just ready to replace either. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=452.88s)]
*  It's really difficult. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=454.96s)]
*  It takes time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=456.0s)]
*  And if you had a situation where your supply chain's cut off [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=457.4s)]
*  and we get some of them from China, by the way, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=461.71999999999997s)]
*  and it's just tough to do. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=464.76s)]
*  If I can just ask you a dumb question. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=468.91999999999996s)]
*  So this, an event like this happened in 1859 [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=470.2s)]
*  and it took out our entire telegraph system. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=473.64s)]
*  So this has been known for quite some time. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=476.24s)]
*  And yet we built a system that's vulnerable to it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=484.68s)]
*  Well, the storms come in varying intensities. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=485.52s)]
*  That Carrington event must have been upwards [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  of like 85 volts per meter, I think. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=495.15999999999997s)]
*  That's what the figure is, the way they measure it. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=499.24s)]
*  And our system is built to take on like eight volts. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=504.2s)]
*  Per kilometer, I mean, eight kilometers. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=511.36s)]
*  And it won't handle it. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=516.8s)]
*  That's what Obama wanted. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=520.4s)]
*  That's what Obama did when he, by executive order, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=523.96s)]
*  wanted to harden our system. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=528.96s)]
*  What did it brought up to that? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=533.36s)]
*  And the regulatory people, NERC and FERC, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=535.16s)]
*  took it and wound up just protecting our infrastructure [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=538.6s)]
*  to eight volts. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=544.48s)]
*  And so it's like 10 times less. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  Because of these other storms that came through, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  one I think was like 12, another one was this or that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=553.16s)]
*  And so it wasn't a worst case scenario, in other words, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=556.16s)]
*  that they prepared for. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=562.12s)]
*  And that's what you need to prepare for. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=563.9200000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=567.6s)]
*  You're describing what we used to call, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=568.6s)]
*  when we believed in God, acts of God. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=570.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=572.0s)]
*  Probably our acts of God, but whatever. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=572.84s)]
*  But things that no human can control. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=574.9200000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=576.64s)]
*  But there's a whole. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=577.48s)]
*  Course majeure. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=578.3000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=579.14s)]
*  So there's a whole nother category though [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=579.98s)]
*  of attacks from adversaries or terrorists. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=583.28s)]
*  Yes, that's the other thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=585.9200000000001s)]
*  What are those? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=587.48s)]
*  Another, I think the world as far as, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=588.32s)]
*  the danger in the world today is much greater [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=594.24s)]
*  than when I was growing up. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=598.0s)]
*  I grew up at the height of the Cold War [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=599.4000000000001s)]
*  where we had duck and cover. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=601.4000000000001s)]
*  I lived in Houston, which was within that circle [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=603.5600000000001s)]
*  during the Cuban Missile Crisis of getting hit, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  and probably would have been hit. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=608.8000000000001s)]
*  And by the bomb, and it's scarier today than it was then. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=610.88s)]
*  At least we had mutual annihilation. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=617.32s)]
*  And we had deterrents based on that. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=622.28s)]
*  That we wouldn't pull the trigger [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=624.84s)]
*  because your adversary was going to destroy you too. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=626.64s)]
*  And today, that club has grown [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=632.16s)]
*  to where it's not only Russia, the United States, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=637.04s)]
*  it's North Korea. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=640.3s)]
*  Yeah, Pakistan. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=641.9s)]
*  That everybody knows. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=642.74s)]
*  Pakistan, India, Iran, which they believe they already, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=643.5600000000001s)]
*  they already have the nuke. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=650.84s)]
*  They just don't have the delivery system for it [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=652.88s)]
*  that could reach the United States. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=654.1999999999999s)]
*  You believe Iran has a nuclear weapon? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=659.16s)]
*  I think they do. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=661.28s)]
*  Russians have been helping them out. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  If they don't have one, they're going to have one [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=668.28s)]
*  within six months to a year. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=670.56s)]
*  And it's really, we've been approaching it, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=673.16s)]
*  well, they don't have the delivery system. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=677.52s)]
*  They don't have the ICBMs that can deliver that [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=679.48s)]
*  all the way to the United States. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=683.6800000000001s)]
*  They definitely could hit Israel though, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=684.96s)]
*  who they're committed to destroying. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=687.84s)]
*  But they also have their terror organizations. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=693.88s)]
*  And it's gotten to the point now where it's getting [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=697.08s)]
*  so condensed, these suitcase dirty bombs, whatever they are. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=700.08s)]
*  You could definitely rig one of those up [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=705.0s)]
*  and hook it to a Scud missile, put it on a cargo ship [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=707.28s)]
*  just off the United States coast, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=711.28s)]
*  send it up to a certain altitude, explode it, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=715.0s)]
*  and what they call a super EMP, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=720.52s)]
*  which is electromagnetic pulse, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=722.64s)]
*  which is the same thing as a geothermal event with the sun. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=724.64s)]
*  If you send up a missile, a nuclear missile, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=730.72s)]
*  with a nuclear bomb on it, it exploded at 400 kilometers [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=737.76s)]
*  above the earth in space, basically. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=744.4399999999999s)]
*  You won't see it, you won't see the explosion [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=748.28s)]
*  because it's in a vacuum of space. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=751.1999999999999s)]
*  You won't hear it. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=753.36s)]
*  No people will be killed. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=755.0s)]
*  But the gamma rays, which are thrown out from that, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=757.0s)]
*  would encompass most of the United States [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=761.28s)]
*  and take out this very same grid, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=764.48s)]
*  and within, which could cause a power outage [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=769.0s)]
*  all across the United States up to months, even a year. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=774.4s)]
*  And we'd have the same scenario that we described before. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=781.24s)]
*  You hate even to game it out, but if that happened, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=784.52s)]
*  if huge parts of the United States had no power for a year, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=787.4s)]
*  I mean, that'd be an extinction event for a lot of people. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=790.88s)]
*  Yeah, they'd done a study, and 90% of the population [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  would be dead within a year. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=797.56s)]
*  In 18, during this Carrington event, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=801.68s)]
*  I mean, one thing, we didn't rely on electricity. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=804.0s)]
*  Everybody had a cow if you wanted milk, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=807.3199999999999s)]
*  and you had a horse if you wanted to drive. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=810.92s)]
*  Your car wouldn't work. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=812.9599999999999s)]
*  What do you do? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=815.64s)]
*  Your telephone doesn't work. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=816.4799999999999s)]
*  There's no way to inform the public about, you know. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=818.4799999999999s)]
*  Anything. Anything. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  So, you're kind of messed up. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=824.24s)]
*  So, I mean, that in some ways seems far more effective [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=826.24s)]
*  than nuclear weapons. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=830.04s)]
*  Not only that, you're not killing people. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=833.0799999999999s)]
*  And so, that makes the decision to use them a little, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=837.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, it's not, you don't have to wrestle [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=844.8s)]
*  with your morals. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=847.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=849.0799999999999s)]
*  There's no smoking hole at Hiroshima. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=850.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=851.72s)]
*  And just like, because there are so many actors doing this, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=852.84s)]
*  and there are terrorist subgroups as well, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=857.64s)]
*  who do you retaliate against if it's done from a cargo ship, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=863.8000000000001s)]
*  and you don't even know where it came from? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=868.6s)]
*  So, who was the perpetrator? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=870.0400000000001s)]
*  And who do you retaliate against? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=873.2800000000001s)]
*  And yes, the military has hardened [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=876.2800000000001s)]
*  most of their infrastructure when it comes to this, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=883.0s)]
*  but they get their electricity, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=887.08s)]
*  90% of their electricity comes, [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=889.4s)]
*  99% of their electricity comes from civilian infrastructure. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=891.24s)]
*  So, how long is that going to last? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=896.44s)]
*  So, do you think one of the magnified EMP attacks [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=899.84s)]
*  would take out a lot, I mean, like most civilian power plants? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=904.84s)]
*  Yeah, just one, what they call a super EMP, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=909.72s)]
*  and that has to do with the altitude where it's exploded, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=913.08s)]
*  you know, from the center of that covers a certain area, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=919.36s)]
*  whereas if you were lower down, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=923.0s)]
*  you would only be able to cover that much area, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=925.0400000000001s)]
*  because it spreads out in a circle. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=927.2s)]
*  And it just fries everything. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=930.64s)]
*  So, why, I mean, I know there are a lot of things [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=932.52s)]
*  to worry about, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  because a lot of things are failing at once, obviously, [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=935.88s)]
*  but this seems like you might want to move it [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=938.36s)]
*  toward the top of the list of things to worry about. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=941.12s)]
*  Yeah, I would think so. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=942.52s)]
*  I really would think so, but it's, [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=944.4s)]
*  and indeed, the Russians and the Chinese [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=948.48s)]
*  have done so much more to harden [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=952.56s)]
*  and to protect their infrastructure than we have. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=955.76s)]
*  And so, it gets down to that whole thing [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=960.36s)]
*  about survivability, you know, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=963.0s)]
*  being able to survive an attack, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=965.36s)]
*  and to attack someone, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=968.4000000000001s)]
*  and then being able to survive when they retaliate. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=971.1600000000001s)]
*  And they've got that going for them. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=976.44s)]
*  And it also makes somebody like, you know, Iran, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=979.12s)]
*  who, it's a fraction of what their military budget is, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=983.08s)]
*  and they know they can't defeat the United States, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=987.88s)]
*  but I mean, even a simple terror group, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=990.48s)]
*  you get their hands on a Scud missile [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=993.16s)]
*  and a nuclear device, you can really do some damage. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=994.84s)]
*  And I don't know why that our government [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1000.44s)]
*  has not been informing us more about this. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1004.52s)]
*  Back during the Cold War, when I was a kid, [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1008.8s)]
*  I was, you know, in the fourth grade, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1010.92s)]
*  we kids were informed about what could happen, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1012.68s)]
*  what to do if something happened, at least that. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1016.32s)]
*  And also, let's get something done. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1021.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't think the average person [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1028.16s)]
*  has any idea that this threat exists. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1029.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1032.24s)]
*  No, they don't. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1033.8400000000001s)]
*  The majority, the vast majority of the people don't. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1035.8400000000001s)]
*  Where is the climate lobby on this? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1039.64s)]
*  I mean, they're very involved in trying to remake the grid [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1043.16s)]
*  and change our sources of energy, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1046.8s)]
*  and they're energy experts, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1049.32s)]
*  but is this something that they're taking up? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1052.04s)]
*  No, not to my knowledge, no. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1054.36s)]
*  Are windmills? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1056.72s)]
*  This really definitely, this has to, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1057.56s)]
*  well, they would be affected too, of course. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1059.84s)]
*  But it's, you know, that's all about the fuel [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  that comes to the power agency, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1068.08s)]
*  whether it be coal or wind or whatever it is, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1069.84s)]
*  but if you knock out these relay stations, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1073.6799999999998s)]
*  the power can't go anywhere. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1077.28s)]
*  Just fries everything. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1079.48s)]
*  So this does suggest, I mean, our country's population [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1081.36s)]
*  is clustered in cities. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1085.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1086.8s)]
*  Those probably aren't gonna fare as well. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1087.8s)]
*  No, it'd be easier to live in the country, of course, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1089.56s)]
*  and people who live in the country [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1092.6399999999999s)]
*  would probably have better ideas, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1095.04s)]
*  better knowledge of how to survive after an event like this. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1097.8s)]
*  But it's a scary proposition. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1102.8s)]
*  I mean, there needs to be education, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1107.5600000000002s)]
*  and there needs to be something done about it, [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1108.68s)]
*  and done about it pretty quick. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1111.4s)]
*  I mean, these protective relays [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1114.24s)]
*  that could be installed in the transformers, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1116.76s)]
*  starting with that, I mean, we have the technology. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1119.16s)]
*  We know how to do this. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1121.68s)]
*  It's not something mysterious [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1123.52s)]
*  that we have to get involved in. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1125.28s)]
*  What we do need is something like a Manhattan Project [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1127.4s)]
*  that we had back during World War II, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1130.16s)]
*  where, you know, the Germans, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1134.16s)]
*  we knew that the Germans were trying to develop a bomb, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1136.28s)]
*  and so we got there quicker. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1139.36s)]
*  And somebody to cut through all the bureaucratic red tape [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1142.68s)]
*  and be vested with the authority to, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1147.6s)]
*  just to get this done, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1152.32s)]
*  we could do it in a couple of years. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1154.4s)]
*  So you mentioned FERC, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1156.8s)]
*  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1157.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1159.72s)]
*  I mean, that would be, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1160.56s)]
*  wouldn't that be the agency that would be thinking about this? [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1161.4s)]
*  They are, they, yes, you would think that, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1162.92s)]
*  but that's not the way it works. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1166.44s)]
*  You know, Obama like sent this to Congress, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1168.48s)]
*  I mean, to get it done, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1172.0s)]
*  and then it gets caught in FERC and NERC [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1174.3600000000001s)]
*  because they're controlled by the lobbies, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1178.0s)]
*  the lobbies of the energy lobbies that it's about, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1182.76s)]
*  they'd have to spend money, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1187.1200000000001s)]
*  and which they don't necessarily want to do, [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1188.96s)]
*  because, you know, it costs a lot. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1193.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes, it would cost a lot. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  I think the government should help in this. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1196.72s)]
*  And there's so many of them too, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1200.64s)]
*  scattered across the United States, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1203.04s)]
*  you know, they're locally owned, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1206.0s)]
*  most of the energy companies. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1207.64s)]
*  There's an energy company in South Carolina [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1210.76s)]
*  that is really doing something about it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1213.8s)]
*  And there have been some cases [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1216.72s)]
*  where we've had energy companies [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1218.24s)]
*  that are making moves to protect the grid, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1221.4s)]
*  but that's only one little part of the grid. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1226.0s)]
*  You know, when it comes down to it, [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1228.56s)]
*  they depend on the one next door to them [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1231.1200000000001s)]
*  and the one next door to them. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1233.96s)]
*  It would cure the AI problem pretty quick though, right? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1235.96s)]
*  You'd have no AI within a little. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1238.76s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1240.56s)]
*  But you wonder, there's all these, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1241.96s)]
*  I mean, a huge part of the American economy [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1243.28s)]
*  is based on digital commerce, digital innovation. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1245.32s)]
*  I mean, this is being- [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1250.12s)]
*  Right, financial system is gonna break down. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1251.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1253.72s)]
*  Transportation breaks down, your water doesn't work, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1254.56s)]
*  food delivery is gone, [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1258.28s)]
*  your telephones don't work. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1262.28s)]
*  You go back to, basically we go back to that current event, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1264.84s)]
*  the world goes back to 1859 and we're all in the dark [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1268.6799999999998s)]
*  and the lights are out. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  So you would think that all these other sectors [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1273.6s)]
*  of the economy would be lobbying, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1276.6799999999998s)]
*  because they all are dependent on electricity. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1278.12s)]
*  Everybody's dependent on electricity. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1280.28s)]
*  So if I'm Google or if I'm Microsoft running AI or whatever, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1281.52s)]
*  like I need a- [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1288.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1289.6s)]
*  I would be lobbying for this. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1290.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, especially you, you've gotta have that. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1291.28s)]
*  And plus also just the effects of the gamma rays [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1292.6799999999998s)]
*  upon these microchips [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1299.28s)]
*  that they're melted. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1302.04s)]
*  Actually, you know who the largest manufacturer [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1305.96s)]
*  of vacuum tubes is? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1308.96s)]
*  Russia. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1311.2s)]
*  Vacuum tubes? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1312.24s)]
*  Vacuum tubes, Russia and China. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1313.16s)]
*  They are still in the business of manufacturing vacuum tubes [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1315.56s)]
*  because they are far more resistant. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1320.0s)]
*  They are far more resistant to these gamma rays. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1323.0s)]
*  Are you serious? [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1328.8400000000001s)]
*  Microchips. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1329.68s)]
*  Do they make- [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1331.2s)]
*  Old analog technology is, you know, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1332.04s)]
*  would work with internet dial-up, you know. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1336.4s)]
*  Are they making horse carriages too? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1342.0s)]
*  Probably should be. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1344.0800000000002s)]
*  They probably should be, yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1344.92s)]
*  So, okay, well you just blew my mind. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1347.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wanna go out and join the cavalry, you guys. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1349.6000000000001s)]
*  So what kind of reaction are you getting [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1353.0s)]
*  when you tell people this? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1355.4s)]
*  I'm now as a gait, kinda like you. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1357.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1359.68s)]
*  Yeah, because nobody hears about it. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1360.52s)]
*  And it's something we don't like to think about. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1362.12s)]
*  But it's, you know, I think people think of it [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1366.44s)]
*  in terms of an asteroid which is on its way [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1368.84s)]
*  to destroy the earth, you know. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1373.12s)]
*  That seems like a very remote, in fact, it is very remote. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1375.44s)]
*  But this is, you know, whether from the sun or a bad actor, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1382.0s)]
*  this is something that 100% chance it's going to happen. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1385.48s)]
*  And we are just nowhere, no way prepared for it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1391.3600000000001s)]
*  That's absolutely terrifying. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1397.6s)]
*  So of all the projects you've done, 150-ish, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1400.24s)]
*  I mean, this has got a rate among the most significant. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1405.48s)]
*  Yeah, David Tice, he was a producer, [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1409.08s)]
*  he produced Soul Surfer, that movie. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1413.56s)]
*  And he's a patriot and a really smart individual. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1415.76s)]
*  And he called me up because he created this movie, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1420.24s)]
*  Grid Down, Power Up, that's the name of it. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1428.04s)]
*  And asked me if I wanted to be involved [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1430.76s)]
*  and I'd seen that 60 Minutes episode, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1433.6s)]
*  you know, about the geothermal event happening like that. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1435.6799999999998s)]
*  And I just said yes, because I remember, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1439.28s)]
*  really frightened me when I saw it. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1443.76s)]
*  And I, like everybody else, had just gone on and forgotten it [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1445.8s)]
*  because we have so many threats that are right in front of us [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1449.32s)]
*  that this gets pushed to the background. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1454.32s)]
*  It seems like a pretty obvious one, though. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1458.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and it's always the one you don't see, you know, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1460.76s)]
*  that gets you. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1466.04s)]
*  It gives us feet of clay, basically. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1467.6799999999998s)]
*  We may be the big, bad, greatest nation on earth, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1470.64s)]
*  United States, with all our, but in some ways, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1475.64s)]
*  all of this technology, this highly industrial complex [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1479.64s)]
*  that we build has feet of clay [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1485.92s)]
*  because of this little simple thing. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1489.56s)]
*  It's kind of perfect, though, isn't it? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1493.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1495.1200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it is Tower of Babel stuff, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1495.96s)]
*  like people build this. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1497.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's the Trojan horse, you know? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1498.28s)]
*  Yeah, this massive thing, it is adorable. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1500.88s)]
*  Looking back on all we were talking about, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1502.68s)]
*  fair about all the movies that you've done, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1504.16s)]
*  what are the ones that you remember most vividly? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1505.96s)]
*  Well, the right stuff is my favorite. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1508.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1510.0800000000002s)]
*  Period. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1510.92s)]
*  Because it was, when I grew up in Houston, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1511.76s)]
*  I wanted, you know, John Glenn went up, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1514.04s)]
*  I was in the second grade, and they rolled the TV, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  and everybody that were replaced, wanting to be a cowboy, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1520.0s)]
*  everybody wanted to be an astronaut back then. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1522.96s)]
*  And so, you know, I grew up wanting to be, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1525.88s)]
*  and then along came the book, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1530.9199999999998s)]
*  and I read it like in two days, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1535.1599999999999s)]
*  and wanted to play Gordo Cooper, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1536.96s)]
*  because he was my favorite astronaut back then. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1539.4399999999998s)]
*  He was the youngest one, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1541.52s)]
*  he was like the rock and roll astronaut. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1542.4399999999998s)]
*  And then, couldn't believe it, I got the part. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1544.72s)]
*  And then it turned out Gordo Cooper [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1548.36s)]
*  lived three miles from me in LA. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1549.9199999999998s)]
*  No way. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1551.8799999999999s)]
*  So I called him up, and we became good friends, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1552.72s)]
*  and he turned me on to a flight school, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1555.72s)]
*  and I learned to fly, I got my pilot's license from that, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1560.08s)]
*  and still flying, fly jets now, in fact. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1563.96s)]
*  But it was like the ultimate boyhood fantasy, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1567.72s)]
*  that role, and it took nine months to do it, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1573.56s)]
*  and Chuck Yeager, legendary Chuck Yeager, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1576.32s)]
*  was on the set every day. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1580.96s)]
*  So it was a great time. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1583.32s)]
*  It sounds unbelievable. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1586.0s)]
*  So you said, you were saying off camera, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1587.48s)]
*  that when you started, I think your first movie [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1589.36s)]
*  that you were in or around was 1975, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1592.2s)]
*  like how long did it take to make a movie then? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1596.0s)]
*  It was at least three months, you know, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1599.36s)]
*  to make a movie back then, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1603.32s)]
*  because of the cameras, you know, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1604.6399999999999s)]
*  you shoot one side of a scene, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1607.48s)]
*  then you got what they call turn around, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1609.56s)]
*  and you shoot the other person going the other way, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1611.48s)]
*  and seeing the background the other way, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1613.3600000000001s)]
*  and the lights and the cameras that we had at the time, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1615.3600000000001s)]
*  meant that it was at least, you know, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1618.52s)]
*  a two to four hour turnaround, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1621.0s)]
*  so you just sit in your trailer, wait for that to happen. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1623.4s)]
*  Now all that happens like in 15 minutes, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1626.56s)]
*  and so movies just moves really quick. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1629.16s)]
*  But if you're on, if you're taking, you know, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1633.16s)]
*  months out of your life to go to a location [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1635.8s)]
*  far from your home, and you're in this like biosphere [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1638.24s)]
*  with all the other actors, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1640.8s)]
*  I mean that's like it's own world, right? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1642.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's exactly, and it, you know, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1644.24s)]
*  it's real time consuming, that's the reason, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1649.76s)]
*  I mean now you see actors, you know, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1652.0s)]
*  doing maybe like three, four movies a year, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1653.68s)]
*  because it doesn't take that long. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1656.1599999999999s)]
*  It's not that they're so picky. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1660.2s)]
*  You must get to know the other people on set pretty well. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1662.8s)]
*  Yeah, you do, yeah. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1665.0s)]
*  Yeah, it becomes your world, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1667.72s)]
*  it's a gypsy life basically, being an actor. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1670.84s)]
*  And you know, still work a lot, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1674.52s)]
*  but spend a lot more time at home now. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1676.72s)]
*  But I mean, for decades you must have spent [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1680.68s)]
*  like no time at home. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1683.12s)]
*  Yeah, but that's your life. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1683.96s)]
*  Huh, what's the most fun location? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1687.3999999999999s)]
*  It's better than working for a living. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1689.28s)]
*  Oh, I agree with that. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1690.52s)]
*  Let me put it that way, yeah. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1691.36s)]
*  What are the coolest locations to shoot a movie at? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1692.6s)]
*  Oh, I've been everywhere, I did one in Falls Barred. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1694.3999999999999s)]
*  This was a television streaming series. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1699.76s)]
*  Falls Barred has the northernmost airport in the world. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1703.04s)]
*  It's up there along the outer, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1708.04s)]
*  and it is where Admiral Perry [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1709.72s)]
*  has last stopped before the North Pole. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1711.8000000000002s)]
*  It's above Greenland. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1713.96s)]
*  It's 400 miles from the North Pole. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1715.3200000000002s)]
*  Like the North Star, which if you're, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  you know, here in our, where we are in our latitudes, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1722.48s)]
*  it's about like right there, about 45 degrees. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1726.56s)]
*  There it was up here. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1729.08s)]
*  And we were inside the Arctic Circle, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1731.52s)]
*  which means the northern lights, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1734.44s)]
*  you see a complete circle of it. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1737.92s)]
*  It was like being on another planet. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1740.24s)]
*  So the Earth is round, you're confirming. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1742.08s)]
*  The Earth is completely round. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1743.64s)]
*  Okay, so, but you know that. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1745.64s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1746.88s)]
*  Yes, I can confirm that. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1749.64s)]
*  They had a great little hotel there. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1751.96s)]
*  It's kind of a tourist spot for people to come. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1754.64s)]
*  There were 1,500 people there, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  and 3,000 polar bears, they like to say. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1759.64s)]
*  And it was, that's an interesting community actually, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1762.4s)]
*  because it was started by an American, which is Goodyear. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1767.96s)]
*  Goodyear Tires. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1773.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1774.24s)]
*  It was, that guy went over there [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1775.0800000000002s)]
*  because they had a lot of coal there on that island. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1777.5600000000002s)]
*  And he started a coal mine, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1782.04s)]
*  and people from all over the world came there [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1785.16s)]
*  because it was guaranteed work. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1789.32s)]
*  And that, so it was extremely diverse within that. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1791.56s)]
*  And it still continues to be that today. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1798.04s)]
*  It's, where a lot of people would come there [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1800.36s)]
*  to get like an EU passport. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1805.48s)]
*  So you had like, at the time that I was living there, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1810.16s)]
*  there were like 800 people from Thailand there. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1814.28s)]
*  And you can only stay there like two years, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1818.28s)]
*  and you're not allowed to die there. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1820.6000000000001s)]
*  Really? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1823.0400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, because you can't be buried there. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1823.88s)]
*  They're pretty strict. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1825.2s)]
*  There's no such thing as, yeah. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1826.0400000000002s)]
*  It's supposedly kind of owned by Norway, [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1827.96s)]
*  but it's also the same place [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1830.52s)]
*  where we had our listening post, observation post [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1833.3200000000002s)]
*  during the Cold War, [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1836.52s)]
*  if the ICBMs were coming over from Russia [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1838.08s)]
*  because they'd come over. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1840.4399999999998s)]
*  And then two miles from where we had ours, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1841.6399999999999s)]
*  the Russians had theirs. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1843.9199999999998s)]
*  And that little town is like a ghost town. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1846.96s)]
*  That's another little tourist spot there. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1849.84s)]
*  It's a fascinating place to go. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1851.56s)]
*  And no dying. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1853.9199999999998s)]
*  No dying allowed. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1855.36s)]
*  It's a death-free zone. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1856.6s)]
*  So you brought a guitar. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1858.08s)]
*  Tell us about your interest in music. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1860.6799999999998s)]
*  I've been playing guitar. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1862.84s)]
*  Music was first for me, really, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1864.04s)]
*  you know, from the time I was 12. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1865.52s)]
*  You can't act alone in your room. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1868.76s)]
*  I guess you can. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1871.12s)]
*  Many have tried. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1873.2s)]
*  I guess you can, but there's no one to act with. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1874.04s)]
*  Acting is reacting for me. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1877.1599999999999s)]
*  But music is a thing that your friend, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1879.48s)]
*  as a kid, that was, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1882.9199999999998s)]
*  I was kind of like, music, acting, music, acting. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1884.9199999999998s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1888.84s)]
*  And I became acting, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1890.0s)]
*  but music has always been laced in there, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1892.96s)]
*  and I've always had a band. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1894.84s)]
*  And I knew I was never gonna shred a guitar, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1896.12s)]
*  but I, so I took up songwriting to go with that. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1899.1999999999998s)]
*  How hard is that? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1903.76s)]
*  Songwriting? [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1904.84s)]
*  It's not question being hard. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1905.6799999999998s)]
*  I think if you ask any songwriter, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1907.3999999999999s)]
*  it's like an affliction. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1909.76s)]
*  It's something that you either have or you don't. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1911.04s)]
*  And you get an idea that's a song or whatever, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1914.1599999999999s)]
*  and you, it just, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1916.76s)]
*  it's gonna bother you until you finish it. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1920.6s)]
*  Do you have some working their way out of you right now? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1923.76s)]
*  Yeah, at this moment. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1927.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1928.84s)]
*  Can you play one? [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1931.68s)]
*  Has nothing to do with EMP stuff. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1932.52s)]
*  No, good. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1934.36s)]
*  I need a respite for that. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1935.92s)]
*  I would say, I would play a song. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1936.76s)]
*  That was dark, man. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1937.6s)]
*  Play a song, I'll tell you what, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1938.68s)]
*  I'll play you a song that I think [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1939.8799999999999s)]
*  probably applies to you, Tucker. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1941.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1943.24s)]
*  As well. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1944.08s)]
*  I wrote this because of Chris Christopherson, [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1944.92s)]
*  who, he and Kenya Tucker, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1948.32s)]
*  and Randy Carlisle did a song of mine. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1951.52s)]
*  It's gonna be out. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1953.2s)]
*  Did you know Chris Christopherson? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1954.24s)]
*  Oh yeah, he's a great guy. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1955.56s)]
*  Fantastic. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1957.16s)]
*  But his wife said that nobody calls Chris [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1958.1200000000001s)]
*  because they think he's such a legend. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1960.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1963.48s)]
*  They wouldn't take the call, you know? [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1964.3200000000002s)]
*  So. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1966.48s)]
*  But does he want people to call? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1967.3200000000002s)]
*  He wants people to call. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1969.44s)]
*  So now in my act, when I get up to playing this song, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1970.64s)]
*  I call his wife, Lisa, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1974.04s)]
*  and we all leave a message [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1975.72s)]
*  where the entire audience says hello to Chris. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1978.52s)]
*  It's good. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1981.8s)]
*  But I found that myself, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1982.76s)]
*  this is about me as well, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1984.56s)]
*  but when you get to after a certain age, after 60, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1985.72s)]
*  people start giving you undue respect [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1989.2s)]
*  for things. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1992.16s)]
*  I look forward to that. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1994.3600000000001s)]
*  By calling you, yeah, by calling you legend, right? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1995.2s)]
*  Legend. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1998.44s)]
*  So I wrote this song for that. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=1999.44s)]
*  ["Legend"] [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2001.04s)]

*  ["Legend"] [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2090.2000000000003s)]
*  And if you call me legend again, I might just have to box your ears, you know I will. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2092.16s)]
*  I might just have to see you later, bye bye. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2099.7999999999997s)]
*  I might just have to see you later. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2103.44s)]
*  Excellent! [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2115.16s)]
*  That was awesome! [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2116.16s)]
*  You're welcome Tucker. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2119.6s)]

*  I love that kind of music. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2123.36s)]
*  How would you describe that? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2125.3199999999997s)]
*  That, I don't know, Americana, whatever, good old summertime, that one. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2126.3199999999997s)]
*  That's amazing! [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2130.88s)]
*  When did you write that? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2131.88s)]
*  About two years ago. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2132.88s)]
*  In Rage? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2136.6s)]
*  I mean there are threats of violence in the song, I'm just saying. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2137.6s)]
*  That was after meeting Chris, that episode. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2142.6s)]
*  It kind of sparked that idea. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2146.88s)]
*  Who are your favorite musicians? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2148.68s)]
*  Who do you listen to? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2150.2799999999997s)]
*  He was definitely one of them. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2151.6s)]
*  Currently I'm going through the Frank Sinatra songbook. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2152.96s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2156.08s)]
*  Yeah, because nobody could sing like Frank. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2157.08s)]
*  I mean, just as a musician, you know, the voice is an instrument, his phrasing, incredible. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2160.3599999999997s)]
*  You know, Jerry Lee Lewis, he was one of my piano teachers when I did The Great Balls [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2166.64s)]
*  of Fire. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2172.52s)]
*  You knew him? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2173.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2174.52s)]
*  The whole time we were doing the movie he was right over my back going, you're getting [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2176.36s)]
*  it wrong son! [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2178.8s)]
*  He was really quite an amazing human being in all kinds of ways. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2180.8s)]
*  I was an animal. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2187.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2188.4s)]
*  What was John Prine like? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2189.4s)]
*  John Prine, yeah, he was just a sweetheart of a person. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2190.8s)]
*  Really extremely talented. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2196.6s)]
*  He was such a pure musician. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2198.0s)]
*  It wasn't about fame and fortune for him as much as it was about the music. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2202.04s)]
*  And as a songwriter, I mean, nobody could turn a phrase like him. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2208.16s)]
*  Kind of by himself in the category. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2212.24s)]
*  But he never really became a household name. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2214.72s)]
*  Yeah, but a lot of people know him. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2218.08s)]
*  His music will go on. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2223.92s)]
*  I mean, take somebody like Chris Christopherson, you know, I think that's really kind of the [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2225.72s)]
*  measure. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2229.92s)]
*  You know, I think a song like Bobby McGee, they'll be singing 500 years from now. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2231.2000000000003s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2235.36s)]
*  You know? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2236.36s)]
*  But no one will know. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2237.36s)]
*  Everyone thinks Janis Joplin wrote it. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2238.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2239.84s)]
*  But it's okay. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2240.84s)]
*  She didn't. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2242.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2243.92s)]
*  I particularly like songs that sound like they were written by anonymous. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2244.92s)]
*  You know, a lot of those American songs that are written on the frontier. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2249.08s)]
*  Yeah, just as traditional on it. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2254.12s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2256.52s)]
*  Did you ever know Willie Nelson? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2257.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2259.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've played with Willie Nelson, in fact, on stage a couple of times. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2260.7200000000003s)]
*  What's he like? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2265.2000000000003s)]
*  He's a very generous man. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2266.2000000000003s)]
*  And I mean, gosh, what his contribution to music. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2267.2000000000003s)]
*  And he's still doing it, man. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  He's still doing it just as great as ever. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2273.44s)]
*  Yeah, he's like 90 years old. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2276.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2278.84s)]
*  In the end, looking back on your life, are you more excited about making movies or playing music? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2279.84s)]
*  Living life. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2288.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2289.1200000000003s)]
*  That's what it is for me. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2290.12s)]
*  You know, it's like I've been really, my autobiography is going to be called My Lucky Life because [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2291.64s)]
*  I've really gotten a chance to do so many kinds of things that I never would have thought [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2298.2799999999997s)]
*  I could have done. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2304.04s)]
*  And at this point, you know, my movie career, which has been so fantastic, it's so fulfilling, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2305.7999999999997s)]
*  really. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2314.92s)]
*  I enjoy it so much more now. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2315.92s)]
*  I'm making movies because I'm not trying to get anywhere. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2317.52s)]
*  I'm not trying to attain something. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2320.6s)]
*  I'm just doing the things that really interest me. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2322.92s)]
*  And you know, that keeps the joy in life. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2327.7200000000003s)]
*  Of course. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2331.36s)]
*  You know? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2332.36s)]
*  Do you think that, you know, in 30 years, Hollywood will still be a creative force? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2333.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2339.92s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2341.2400000000002s)]
*  It seems to be spreading out. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2342.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2343.64s)]
*  We're trying to get Hollywood started in Texas, actually. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2344.64s)]
*  We're trying to bring filmmaking there as an industry, not just as a destination for [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2347.2799999999997s)]
*  Hollywood, you know? [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2353.16s)]
*  And I mean, the way it is now, not so many movies are made in California anymore anyway. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2355.24s)]
*  And a lot of the ones that I see in the previews, they all look like the same movie. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2361.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2368.56s)]
*  You know, a few really sneak by there every once in a while. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2369.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2374.0s)]
*  So I just, I gotta ask, gotta end it with the question I ask everybody, but I'm just [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2375.0s)]
*  interested, like, where do you see the country in a year? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2379.7200000000003s)]
*  In a year? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2383.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2384.0s)]
*  Well, I'm really, I'm really tense about next year, the election year. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2385.0s)]
*  It seems that, you know, more than any other time, it's, everybody's got to, like, pick [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2390.52s)]
*  a side. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's, both Democrats and the Republicans, I'm an independent, by the way, and always [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2398.4s)]
*  have been. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2406.6s)]
*  I've thought in both ways, you know, according to what the pendulum of thought the country [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2407.6s)]
*  needed, but both sides seem to think that our country is going to be doomed, that democracy [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2412.28s)]
*  is going to be over if one or the other wins. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2420.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2425.52s)]
*  So how do we get to that place where we can have that transition of power like we did [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2426.64s)]
*  not so long ago, where at least people could tolerate it without having to, you know, basically [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2433.2s)]
*  have a coup in one way or another, a military coup. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2441.8s)]
*  We really are, I'm afraid of us becoming like a banana republic like that. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2445.32s)]
*  And we're the United States of America. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2450.8s)]
*  We're Americans. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2452.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2454.64s)]
*  And I do believe, I mean, things are a little bit more, they're scarier than they were in [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2456.1600000000003s)]
*  68. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2466.08s)]
*  I mean, Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy was shot, Martin Luther King was shot, all the riots, you [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2467.08s)]
*  know, cities were burning. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2472.84s)]
*  We knew who the leaders were back then, you know, but now it's just this kind of underground [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2478.6400000000003s)]
*  simmering rage on both sides. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2484.76s)]
*  And I, you know, setting aside who's right, who's wrong or whatever, I just think we need [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2488.28s)]
*  to find ways to unite. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2498.7200000000003s)]
*  And America's always found a way to unite. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2502.0400000000004s)]
*  I mean, things, back when they were forming the Constitution, you know, there was a guy, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2505.28s)]
*  who wasn't the king, the other senator in the chambers, it got really bitter. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2515.68s)]
*  It was always about to fall apart. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2523.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's fragile. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2525.24s)]
*  And Reagan is right, you know, our democracy is, you know, can be lost in a generation. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2526.9599999999996s)]
*  It only takes a generation to lose it. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2535.72s)]
*  And I think we need to educate our kids what a great country this is, and that we're in [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2540.68s)]
*  spite of our way we don't agree that we agree to that we're Americans. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2545.4399999999996s)]
*  And so, God bless us. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2556.3599999999997s)]
*  And you know, I just like to see cooler heads prevail. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2560.8799999999997s)]
*  Do you feel that there are cooler heads out there? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2566.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I think as individuals, we can be, in general, we have cooler heads. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2569.36s)]
*  You know, I guess it's the mob that, whether it be on the right or the left or somewhere [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2577.36s)]
*  else, you know, that it gets confusing. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2585.6400000000003s)]
*  Very. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2590.6000000000004s)]
*  It gets really confusing. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2591.6000000000004s)]
*  Well, I hope I see you in a year. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2593.6000000000004s)]
*  I think I will, Tucker. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2597.6000000000004s)]
*  I think so, too. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2598.92s)]
*  That's great. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJ_SofFm0g&t=2599.92s)]
