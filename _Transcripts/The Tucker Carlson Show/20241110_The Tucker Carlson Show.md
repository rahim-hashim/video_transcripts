# National Security Expert Elbridge Colby’s Advice to Trump on How to Avoid WWIII & Handle the CIA
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [November 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw)
*  We are now three days out from the election. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a mad scramble, of course, in Washington for people to get positions of power in the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=22.68s)]
*  new administration. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=28.16s)]
*  Some of them are good people, some of them are not. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=29.96s)]
*  You are being widely discussed as potentially the next national security advisor or secretary [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=32.32s)]
*  of defense taking over DOD. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=38.08s)]
*  I don't know what's going to happen. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=40.4s)]
*  I'm fairly confident you'll play a large and meaningful role in this administration. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=41.4s)]
*  You're never going to say any of that, but I thought that the audience might like some [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=46.8s)]
*  context for having this conversation. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=50.56s)]
*  I think you're one of the very few people with deep experience in national security [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=52.6s)]
*  There's the context. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=58.72s)]
*  What does this next administration need to do in order to remain true to the president-elect's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=68.08s)]
*  articulated positions on war and peace? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=75.84s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker, and thank you very much, first off, for your confidence in me. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=79.4s)]
*  It means a great deal. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=82.84s)]
*  It's heartfelt. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=83.84s)]
*  Well, I know, and that's why I'm deeply grateful and honored. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=85.04s)]
*  I clearly don't make any presumptions about any role for myself, but what I would say, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  and I mean this with all sincerity, is that I think the president-elect is exactly right [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=93.16s)]
*  that we stand on the possible precipice of World War III and we need a fundamental change [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=99.16s)]
*  before we ram right into the iceberg. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=103.12s)]
*  I think the election is over, but this remains absolutely true, is that what I call the liberal [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=105.4s)]
*  primacist alliance. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=110.36s)]
*  Basically the kind of policies of President Biden, Vice President Harris aligned with [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=112.52s)]
*  the primacists, I call them, we could call them the neoconservatives, have led us to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  a situation in which we're overextended, we're on the brink of war in multiple theaters, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=120.24s)]
*  and we could lose them. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=124.36s)]
*  And I really want peace. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=125.55999999999999s)]
*  And more importantly, President Trump ran to his historic credit on an agenda, as he [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  said in his victory speech, I don't start wars, I end them. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=134.28s)]
*  Now I think my view is that we have to have, how you actually get to peace is a difficult [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=139.56s)]
*  question and I had the honor of being on your show a few years ago when my book came out [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=145.4s)]
*  and I remember, I don't know if you recall, but I said I was thinking about your question [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=149.6s)]
*  to President Trump about why is it worth defending allies. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=153.32s)]
*  And I gave that a lot of thought and in a sense my book is a response to that question. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think you do need strength, you do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=160.2s)]
*  But you need peace through strength, but that term has become cheapened and distorted to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=162.84s)]
*  become basically an excuse for an aggressive expansionist approach to foreign policy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=169.08s)]
*  But I think you do, you know, it's real meaning and President Trump is in a sense going back [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=175.56s)]
*  to the great tradition of the Republican Party, the Weinberger doctrine, the Powell doctrine, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=180.06s)]
*  Nixon, Eisenhower, as Bob Dole used to put it, these are Democrat wars, it used to be [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=184.4s)]
*  Democrats that started wars and Republicans that ended or avoided them. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=189.08s)]
*  Eisenhower didn't go into Vietnam in 1954, he did not intervene in Hungary in 1956. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  Nobody thought he was a weak guy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=198.12s)]
*  So what needs to happen right now? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Before you get into that, I just think it might be helpful to describe where we are [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=201.28s)]
*  now because a lot of Americans, I'm in this category, were so absorbed in the election [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=207.88s)]
*  that we may have lost touch with what you opened your remarks by noting, which is we're [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=213.72s)]
*  on the brink of war in multiple theaters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=218.48s)]
*  Will you tell us where we are? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=220.35999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=221.76s)]
*  I think for the first time in basically 150 years, we are not clearly the world's largest [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=222.92s)]
*  economy. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=228.16s)]
*  We compete for that with China and they are a far larger industrial power. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=229.16s)]
*  Russia in purchasing power parity terms is a very large economy with enormous industrial [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  production capacity. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  So North Korea advancing its nuclear missile program. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=237.89999999999998s)]
*  Russia is a larger manufacturing economy than a lot of us appreciate it, I think. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=241.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, despite a lot of boasting, they're still out producing the North Atlantic Alliance, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=244.76s)]
*  including the United States, in artillery production, which is old technology by like [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=248.68s)]
*  a factor of two or three. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=252.68s)]
*  Iran's two weeks from a nuclear weapon, according to Tony Blinken, and worse, these actors have [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=254.88s)]
*  come together. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=259.88s)]
*  Now you will hear from the sort of primacists and liberals that that means that we have [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=260.88s)]
*  to fight them all at the same time. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=264.32s)]
*  No, to the contrary, it means they are collaborating together precisely to tie us down and deplete [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=265.44s)]
*  us and that's what's happened in the war in Ukraine, where we have expended a tremendous [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=270.72s)]
*  amount of weapons, ditto in places like attacking the Houthis and so forth. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=274.4s)]
*  At the same time, our defense industrial base has wildly atrophied from where it was 30 [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=278.53999999999996s)]
*  years ago. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  And this is why the agenda for reindustrialization is so important. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=284.03999999999996s)]
*  But that's going to take a long time, as Senator Vance has pointed out. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=286.67999999999995s)]
*  Meantime, China. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=290.12s)]
*  Wait, so can I say it's not, I mean, I thought one of the justifications, the main justification [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=291.12s)]
*  for this wildly inflated Ukraine funding was that it was going to help reestablish America's [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=297.35999999999996s)]
*  industrial base. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=303.48s)]
*  Didn't happen. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=304.48s)]
*  In fact, one of the most kind of oft used arguments by a lot of the advocates for the [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=305.48s)]
*  war in Ukraine was that we would sort of degrade the Russian military for a song and restore [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=310.28s)]
*  our defense industrial base at the same time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=314.44s)]
*  Actually more or less the reverse has happened. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=316.8s)]
*  The Russian military is larger and this is, you know, General Kovolny, the SACEUR has [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=319.12s)]
*  admitted this, the Russian military is larger. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=323.6s)]
*  It's battle hardened. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=325.56s)]
*  I mean, our military has not fought a peer adversary. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=326.56s)]
*  Well, I mean, really since World War II, but certainly since Vietnam and Korea, the Russians [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=330.12s)]
*  have gone toe to toe with Ukrainians who are capable and they have a revved up defense [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=335.52s)]
*  industry at the same time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=339.56s)]
*  So in a sense, we're worse. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=341.15999999999997s)]
*  Meantime, the Europeans have basically been asleep at the switch, not going through with [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  their defense buildup with a few noble exceptions like Poland. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=345.84s)]
*  So and then you look at China, which is by far the most formidable challenger, 10 times [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=349.4s)]
*  the GDP of Russia. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=354.28s)]
*  Tony Blinken has said Xi Jinping has given the instructions to their military to be ready [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=356.76s)]
*  for a war over Taiwan by 2027. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=361.0s)]
*  Frank Kendall, the secretary of the Air Force in the Biden administration said the other [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=363.4s)]
*  day that he thinks the Chinese military will say they're ready. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=366.52s)]
*  We have to be ready for this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=370.12s)]
*  My view is we desperately want peace. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=371.76s)]
*  The Chinese are going to look at us both in terms of our strength, but also in terms of [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=375.48s)]
*  our political commitments. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=379.84s)]
*  And this is where I think President Trump has been exactly right, which is being willing [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=380.84s)]
*  to talk to President Xi Jinping, not insulting President Xi Jinping and President Putin and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=385.16s)]
*  others unnecessarily, not supporting things like Taiwan independence and at the same time [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=389.92s)]
*  being prepared to be strong. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=395.36s)]
*  And this is where I think if if if we appoint or if if people are put into positions of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=396.84000000000003s)]
*  power who think that we can walk and chew gum and do everything and start wars in three [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  different theaters at the same time, not only will that be bad like it was in the Iraq war [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=406.88s)]
*  and often the same people, it will be far more catastrophic. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=410.84000000000003s)]
*  I don't think this is an exaggeration. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=414.04s)]
*  I think we stand on the precipice of losing a major power war for the first time in our [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=415.8s)]
*  history. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=420.24s)]
*  So people need to know what time it is. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=421.24s)]
*  And that really requires focusing on China with the purpose of peace like we did in the [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=422.92s)]
*  Cold War, which was to say we're going to be strong. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=427.56s)]
*  We're not going to go over the line like Eisenhower did in 1950. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=430.32s)]
*  He's not going to go into Hungary. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=432.8s)]
*  We're not going to go to Czechoslovakia in 1968. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=434.0s)]
*  But don't come across our line because you see it's not going to succeed for you. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=435.92s)]
*  So I think we really stand at the crossroads. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=439.28s)]
*  And I think President Trump has a mandate for peace. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=441.32s)]
*  So don't I just as an American, whatever happens to me, I so hope that we don't end up with [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=444.56s)]
*  the same failed recipe of starting wars all over the place or getting enmeshed in conflicts [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=451.76s)]
*  when we can't we can't afford to do so in the non-interest of the American people. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=457.2s)]
*  From a non-expert position, which is my position, just as someone who's watching kind of, there [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=459.84s)]
*  does seem to be broad recognition that whatever our objectives in Ukraine were, we didn't [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=465.24s)]
*  achieve them and we can't. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=470.32s)]
*  Zelensky immediately comes out upon Trump's election and says, actually, I'm for peace. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=471.76s)]
*  That does maybe seem like it's winding down. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=476.56s)]
*  Who knows? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=479.36s)]
*  But the noises are consistent with winding down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=481.71999999999997s)]
*  But at the same time, the very people who are pushing that war all of a sudden, like [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=484.6s)]
*  very excited about a war with Iran. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=487.4s)]
*  It's like they just seamlessly, it's like, oh, Ukraine, whatever. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=489.76s)]
*  Actually the real problem is Iran and telling us that Iran is trying to murder President [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=493.52s)]
*  Trump, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't know what's true. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=498.03999999999996s)]
*  I don't. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=499.32s)]
*  But how would the United States, what would happen if we went to war with Iran? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=500.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think, you know, look, Iran's a bad regime. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=504.08s)]
*  We don't want to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=508.08s)]
*  Of course. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=509.4s)]
*  We don't want to support Israel. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=510.4s)]
*  We don't want to be able to support groups attacking Israel, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=511.4s)]
*  But like, haven't we learned the lesson over the last 25 years about the ill-advised nature [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=514.72s)]
*  of very significant conflicts in the Middle East that don't have clear goals and clear [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=520.52s)]
*  connection to American interests? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=524.28s)]
*  Like, haven't we been over, like, didn't we run this experiment a couple of times? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=525.36s)]
*  And it's often like the exact same people calling for war with Iran who were involved [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=528.48s)]
*  in the past. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=534.88s)]
*  And it's like, shouldn't there be some degree of accountability? [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=535.88s)]
*  Moreover, it's like a bad idea in itself. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=538.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, like I was criticized in the bulwark by Eric Edelman, who is Dick Cheney's [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=541.52s)]
*  advisor and number three at the Pentagon under Bush. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=546.0s)]
*  He said my ideas were iconoclastic. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=548.52s)]
*  And I was like, thank you. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=550.8s)]
*  I'm delighted that you think my ideas are iconoclastic. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=551.8s)]
*  How could Eric Edelman be writing with any credibility at all on foreign policy questions [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=554.12s)]
*  after being intimately involved in the Iraq war and then never apologizing? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=558.64s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=563.6s)]
*  There should be some international authority that requires contrition, like a moral UN [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=564.6s)]
*  where you don't get to say another word until you don ashes and sackcloth and apologize. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=569.68s)]
*  Who among us is an I'm certainly not inerrant. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm certainly not infallible. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=577.04s)]
*  But like at least show some, you know, it's like Paul Zhago, the Wall Street Journal, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=578.32s)]
*  like a year ago gave a speech to the eye, treated the Iraq war as like a mulligan. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like, I think that's like a big deal. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=585.24s)]
*  And obviously a lot of people got it, you know, had different views, et cetera. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=588.24s)]
*  But it's like it's kind of show the contrition, show the penance, show the show the learning. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=591.4000000000001s)]
*  And so that I think is the other thing, though, Tucker is like, it's the same people who are [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=595.84s)]
*  calling for attacking Iran, who are also calling for escalating the war in Ukraine or even [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=599.8000000000001s)]
*  a no fly zone, recognizing it in the Taiwan or getting in a war with China or attacking [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=606.2800000000001s)]
*  North Korea. It's like if we do all those things, we know objectively as a fact that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=611.84s)]
*  our military is not capable of fighting more than one major war at a time. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=615.5600000000001s)]
*  So even if you did want to getting in multiple fights with people at the same time is just [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=619.2s)]
*  like foolhardy. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=624.0s)]
*  And I mean, but the way I think about it is the Washington blob establishment can get [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=625.44s)]
*  us into wars and crises, but they can't fix the problem. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=630.5200000000001s)]
*  So it's really important right now. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=633.76s)]
*  And it seems to me that you're just listening to President Trump and his historic victory, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=636.08s)]
*  the decisive mandate he got, his leadership, his mandate, his agenda for peace from position [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=640.12s)]
*  of strength, use the military sparingly, but have it be strong. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=644.76s)]
*  It's really important not to get enmeshed all over the place and either bleed ourselves [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=648.5s)]
*  out or catastrophic multi front loss. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=653.26s)]
*  I think that's the last thing Donald Trump wants. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  It seems that way. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=659.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=660.64s)]
*  I mean, the arc of his life is just so remarkable. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=661.64s)]
*  The redemption that we just saw on Tuesday without precedent really in American history. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=664.0s)]
*  And so if you wanted to destroy his presidency, his second presidency, what's the one foolproof [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=668.48s)]
*  way to destroy it? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=674.8000000000001s)]
*  No president has ever lost a great power war. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=676.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has run to his enormous historic credit. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=679.24s)]
*  He has been shot. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=682.0400000000001s)]
*  He has had lawfare conducted against him and he has had the bravery and the vision and [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=683.4s)]
*  the persistence and the commitment at great personal physical cost, but also to his reputation, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=688.92s)]
*  his family, et cetera, to stand up for these principles that the United States desperately [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=693.68s)]
*  needs. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  Putting Americans interests first, peace, prosperity, et cetera, reindustrialization. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=699.7199999999999s)]
*  Now is the time to put that into practice, whoever it is. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=704.92s)]
*  I just, I can't stress how important that is. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=707.56s)]
*  And if you're thinking about a historical legacy, Joe Biden's going to leave a legacy [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=710.36s)]
*  that's terrible. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=713.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, where the, you know, for all the things you mentioned, the war in Ukraine. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=714.8399999999999s)]
*  Two and a half years in Julian Barnes, the New York Times just reported that the intelligence [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=718.84s)]
*  community is reporting that the Ukrainians are losing, that it's not a stalemate. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=723.24s)]
*  So after all that, after all the preaching, after all the moralism, the Ukrainians are [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=727.6800000000001s)]
*  losing the war and the Russians are making enormous progress and we're unprepared. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=732.24s)]
*  We're unprepared for a war with China. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=736.48s)]
*  The Middle East is in the worst situation in years. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=738.52s)]
*  We can't even stop the Houthis like a third or fourth rate power and we're not prepared. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=741.64s)]
*  So they've left us on the precipice. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=747.76s)]
*  They've put us on a, you know, the Titanic is directing towards the iceberg. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=749.8s)]
*  It's going to take a sharp turn. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=754.22s)]
*  And the way I think about this, and when I worked at the Browner to work for president [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=756.62s)]
*  Trump in his first term, when we worked on the defense strategy to try to get us to prioritize [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=759.8s)]
*  again, in my view with the same logic, very consistent with what president Trump I think [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=764.28s)]
*  was trying to lay out. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=768.0s)]
*  That was like, you know, we were a couple miles from the iceberg back then. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=769.88s)]
*  Now we're like right up, you know, we're a few thousand yards and it's not easy to turn [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=773.56s)]
*  the Titanic. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=777.48s)]
*  And if you turn the Titanic 90 degrees, people are going to fall out of their bunks. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=778.48s)]
*  Chandeliers and beautiful plates are going to get broken. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=782.9200000000001s)]
*  But that's where we are. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=785.54s)]
*  But that is the fault of what I call the liberal primacist alliance. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=786.54s)]
*  That is the fault of Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and the primacist sort of old school Republicans [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=789.12s)]
*  who if they pursued that policy further would lead us to catastrophe. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=794.76s)]
*  Then how is it that from what I can tell, pretty much every person in the running for [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=799.16s)]
*  the big national security jobs other than you is part of that alliance. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=804.0400000000001s)]
*  And I know them all and I like some of them, a couple sitting US senators who I think are [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=808.76s)]
*  really nice guys. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=813.4000000000001s)]
*  But they're tools of the people you describe, like completely. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=815.8000000000001s)]
*  There's kind of no doubt about it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=819.2800000000001s)]
*  How is it that there are so few people on the Republican side in national security with [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=822.4200000000001s)]
*  experience who agree with the presidential act who leads the party? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=826.6s)]
*  So I've thought a lot about this because I've been fighting as you kindly gesture and [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=832.56s)]
*  a sort of a lonely battle within the sort of blob to put us on like to me what is common [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=836.5s)]
*  sense. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=841.5999999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=842.5999999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=843.5999999999999s)]
*  And yet so few people do it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=844.5999999999999s)]
*  And why is that? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=845.5999999999999s)]
*  It's so weird. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=846.5999999999999s)]
*  And honestly, so much of your insight and some commentaries both on this show and your [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=847.5999999999999s)]
*  other podcast interviews and your shows, etc. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=851.2199999999999s)]
*  Because I think it's like I think there's a human sociological element. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=854.5s)]
*  I mean, not to get and one of the things that's kind of bizarre is that I think like today [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=857.0s)]
*  We can learn a lot from the new left of the 60s and 70s. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=861.08s)]
*  There's something wrong with the establishment and the way the establishment. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=863.88s)]
*  Now I believe there's always an establishment. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=868.0400000000001s)]
*  There's an establishment in Mao's China, but we need a better establishment. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=869.4000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=872.72s)]
*  You know, you're a fan of Teddy Roosevelt too. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=873.72s)]
*  Like the idea that like the establishment just does what it used to do is like, no, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=875.76s)]
*  the point is the establishment is supposed to serve the people, right? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=880.32s)]
*  Of course. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=882.9200000000001s)]
*  But I think there's an element and I try to give credit because like, yeah, there's money [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=883.9200000000001s)]
*  and stuff, but there's other ways of making money. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=887.5400000000001s)]
*  I think it's this psychic kind of like network benefit of being part of like essentially [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=889.0799999999999s)]
*  functionally an imperial capital. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=893.88s)]
*  And everybody comes to you know this, right? [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=896.28s)]
*  They come to the capital and say, you're so wise. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=898.4s)]
*  We need your leadership. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=900.4599999999999s)]
*  You're so you're so moral and your vision. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=901.8399999999999s)]
*  And it happens in Congress where people come, they probably not thought about foreign policy [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=904.42s)]
*  that much. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=907.92s)]
*  There are all these structures set up to kind of acculturate them. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=908.92s)]
*  And again, like I don't want to sound too new left, but like, you know, this is kind [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=911.24s)]
*  of what happens. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=915.12s)]
*  And so you need, I think, a clear eyed view of how to change and frankly, a willingness [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=916.28s)]
*  to buck the system. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=922.1999999999999s)]
*  And this to me is like, and I'm certainly far from the only person to make this point. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=923.1999999999999s)]
*  I think you have as well as like, President Trump ran against the system. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=926.4s)]
*  And that is so important because it's the system, the liberal primacy, the Alliance [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=930.66s)]
*  in other things like trade and economics, et cetera, that need to be a fundamental change. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=933.92s)]
*  And already he's paid the price literally and shown the bravery and commitment to go [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=940.26s)]
*  through that. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=944.42s)]
*  And so now it's about like capitalizing. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=945.76s)]
*  And frankly, my hope is if that happened, a lot of these people, especially in the younger [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=948.2s)]
*  generations would follow. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=953.88s)]
*  And I forgive me for a little bit of patting myself on the back, but I think it's an apropos [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=955.12s)]
*  comment I was out at a thing a few months ago and this young guy came up, you know, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=958.56s)]
*  strong guy, whatever. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=962.52s)]
*  And he said, Hey, you know, Mr. Colby, I'm going in the Marines. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=963.52s)]
*  And I just want to say all the young Republicans love what you're saying. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=966.64s)]
*  And I said to him, I was like, well, that's good. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=970.48s)]
*  Because all the old Republicans hate it. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=971.92s)]
*  And he's like, yeah, that's the point. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=973.34s)]
*  Boy, do they, boy, do they, they do that. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=974.4200000000001s)]
*  And that's like to me, I always I think about I'm like the first line, not to if this is [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=976.3000000000001s)]
*  although you know, there are people out there you wonder about. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=981.0600000000001s)]
*  But like this is this is not like actually getting shot. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=983.1s)]
*  But it's like I'm trying to think about how do we protect Americans from not getting shot? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=986.0400000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=990.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=991.2s)]
*  And so and so I think the young people can see it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=992.2s)]
*  You know, the young people who are like, you know, who are not bought in to, you know, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=993.6s)]
*  who have not been kind of acculturated, worked for ex senator on this committee for 10 years [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=999.72s)]
*  and then went to that think tank and blah, blah, blah. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1003.74s)]
*  I think I think they if you build it, they will come. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1005.74s)]
*  But it's like the first echelon. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  We take a lot of we take a lot of metaphorical flack, hopefully metaphorical. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1011.74s)]
*  I just and I won't go on about this, but I am a little bit distressed by it, very distressed by it. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1015.74s)]
*  But like someone like Mike Pompeo, I'll just say the name who I don't think is going to get a job in this administration. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1023.3399999999999s)]
*  I would pray that he's not. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1028.22s)]
*  I think he's a criminal. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1029.78s)]
*  I've said that plotted to murder someone who hadn't even been charged with a crime. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1030.86s)]
*  That's a criminal act should be arrested for that. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1034.1399999999999s)]
*  That's my view. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1036.22s)]
*  But even if you don't believe that he's been anti Trump for eight years, worked against [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1038.42s)]
*  Trump and he's a crazed neocon. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1044.78s)]
*  And he's still being talked about and promoted again. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1048.34s)]
*  I don't think he's going to get the job, but promoted to run the national security establishment [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1050.3s)]
*  in in the United States. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1055.22s)]
*  How can that even happen? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1057.78s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, I think it's if I were advising President Trump, I would say, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1060.38s)]
*  especially now that the mandate has happened. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1067.3s)]
*  Yes. Why pick some anybody who's not aligned with what you're trying to do? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1069.54s)]
*  I mean, I saw the last ad that President Trump ran. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1074.9s)]
*  I mean, it was a stirring ad like it won. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1078.18s)]
*  Who is in that ad? You, Tulsi Gabbard, Robert F. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1080.86s)]
*  Kennedy, Jr., Vivek and and Vice President-elect Vance. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1084.62s)]
*  That is the mandate, you know. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1088.62s)]
*  So so like my hope is that he will own that. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1091.54s)]
*  And that is the way for that's the way for peace. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1095.54s)]
*  And there's going to be debates about various policies and how to emphasize this or that. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1097.7399999999998s)]
*  But why go back in, especially in a situation where as successful as the first term is, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1101.8999999999999s)]
*  the situation that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are leaving President Trump in January is [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1108.1399999999999s)]
*  I cannot stress how dangerous it is. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1113.82s)]
*  And he's right. I mean, the way that President Trump, again, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1115.4199999999998s)]
*  has commendably talked about the risk of nuclear war. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1117.94s)]
*  I worked on nuclear issues a lot. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1120.42s)]
*  My kind of starting point a lot was like working on nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy and arms control. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1122.22s)]
*  I worked on arms control with the Russians. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1126.5400000000002s)]
*  We should be afraid of these things. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1128.3000000000002s)]
*  You know, a salutary fear, not like an unmanned fear, if you will. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1130.18s)]
*  Right. But like a salutary fear. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1134.22s)]
*  You know, the beginning of wisdom is fear or whatever the Bible says to that effect. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1136.3000000000002s)]
*  I should know that. But it's true. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1139.3400000000001s)]
*  It's true. Right. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1141.1000000000001s)]
*  Is understanding and calibrating. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1142.14s)]
*  And to me, one of the like touch grass kind of things [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1143.8600000000001s)]
*  about a lot of the people who are calling for like no fly zones in over Ukraine and intervening [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1146.7s)]
*  against the Russians and escalating and allowing U.S. weapons to be overtly used to attack Moscow [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1151.9s)]
*  and Russian strategic forces sites. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1156.7s)]
*  Like that is obviously crazy. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1159.26s)]
*  It's like time out. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1162.3s)]
*  Like that is obviously. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1163.5s)]
*  There are many Republicans. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1164.78s)]
*  Yes. In fact, some of the that's why I think that the arguments within the Republican Party in some [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1165.82s)]
*  ways are fiercer because my hope, Tucker, and I think this is something you've been, you know, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1170.3s)]
*  on for a while, but it's like the Democrats are like they're sort of inherently out of position [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1176.7s)]
*  right now. Like where is the left? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1181.42s)]
*  Where are the people who are like antiwar? [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1183.74s)]
*  Where are the people who say the CIA is not above reproach or the FBI is not above reproach? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1185.98s)]
*  Who are the people, you know, Kurt, right Mills or whatever, the power elite and all this stuff. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1190.3s)]
*  Those people have those movements have to come back. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1195.9s)]
*  And and and I think that that's something where, especially given the mandate that President Trump [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1199.18s)]
*  has been has won that hope. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1203.98s)]
*  I mean, you know, whatever you think of Bernie Sanders, the fact that he said like we're out of [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1206.06s)]
*  we're out of position, you know, and others are saying they're out of position. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1209.1s)]
*  And my hope is that Democrats will go back in a sense, the kind of arguments that I'm making [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1211.9s)]
*  that I think you could have heard a Democrat make 10 minutes ago. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1216.7s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1220.14s)]
*  Or 30 years ago, 40 years ago. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1220.38s)]
*  Hey, we need we've got to be able to talk to our opponents. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1221.9s)]
*  We have to have a strong military but not get into unnecessary wars. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1224.78s)]
*  That's just common sense. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1228.38s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1229.9s)]
*  Do you remember when Democrats used to refer to abortion as something that should be safe, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1231.58s)]
*  legal and rare? [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1235.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, they've changed their view on that. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1236.9399999999998s)]
*  It went from a right to a sacrament. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1238.9399999999998s)]
*  This isn't the pro-choice movement you may remember from 30 years ago. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1241.82s)]
*  This is something much darker. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1246.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's why we have joined forces with preborn, their sponsor of the show and of our speaking tour [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1248.1399999999999s)]
*  to do something about it. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1253.4199999999998s)]
*  The largest pro-life organization in the United States. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1254.4599999999998s)]
*  And they are doing what they should do, which is speaking up against this atrocity, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1257.42s)]
*  killing babies after birth. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1263.26s)]
*  No one seems to have the bravery to call that wrong, which it is. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1266.0600000000002s)]
*  But preborn is calling it out. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1270.14s)]
*  Their networks of clinics are positioned in the highest abortion areas in the country. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1271.98s)]
*  And they've rescued 300,000 babies. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1276.38s)]
*  When a woman considering an abortion searches to end her baby's life, preborn is there. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1278.3000000000002s)]
*  The power of ultrasound combined with the love of God doubles the baby's chance of being born. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1283.34s)]
*  A single ultrasound costs 28 bucks. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1288.78s)]
*  Five ultrasounds are 140 bucks. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1291.5s)]
*  Giving women the information they need to make the decision that many of them actually want to make, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1294.3s)]
*  to have a baby. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1299.66s)]
*  Any gift will help and all gifts are tax deductible. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1301.58s)]
*  To donate securely, go to preborn.com slash Tucker or call pound 250 on your phone. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1304.78s)]
*  And when asked, use the word baby. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1310.78s)]
*  You mentioned CIA. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1313.82s)]
*  Now is probably a good time to address it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1315.1s)]
*  Your last name is Colby. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1317.42s)]
*  That is familiar. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1318.54s)]
*  That's a familiar name. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1319.98s)]
*  Anyone knows the history of the Central Intelligence Agency your grandfather ran at, William Colby. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1320.7s)]
*  And so there are two interesting things. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1327.1s)]
*  One is I'm sure this will set off just explosions of theorizing on the internet. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1328.86s)]
*  You're a... [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1334.3s)]
*  So what is your view of CIA? [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1334.78s)]
*  How was... [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1336.46s)]
*  That's why I think that's why your family's in Washington because you're... [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1337.02s)]
*  Well, actually, my great grandfather was a career army officer. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1339.58s)]
*  So I come from a kind of a national security background. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1343.34s)]
*  I mean, my dad, not so much. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1347.26s)]
*  But look, my view on the intelligence community, I worked on this stuff myself when I was kind [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1349.18s)]
*  of early in my career, although on the commission that looked at why Iraq intelligence is wrong. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1353.18s)]
*  I didn't agree with my grandfather for everything. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1357.02s)]
*  With everything, I didn't know him super well. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1359.1s)]
*  I mean, I know a lot about how he approached things and how his record and so forth. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1361.26s)]
*  One thing where I do really agree with him [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1366.7s)]
*  and where his legal training and the fact that actually, as Jim Slussinger said, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1368.86s)]
*  he was the first liberal to become director of central intelligence was that he thought, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1372.3799999999999s)]
*  and I agree with him, that you need a CIA. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1376.06s)]
*  You need a national security establishment, but it's not above reproach and it needs to [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1378.54s)]
*  be accountable. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1383.26s)]
*  And that's what he... [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1383.98s)]
*  You know, the interesting thing about him, and just to stress that I don't take any credit [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1384.7s)]
*  for it, like I'm just telling you just because you asked me, but you know, he was in World War II. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1388.86s)]
*  He was then a field guy. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1393.02s)]
*  He was in Europe and then he was in Vietnam for a long time. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1394.3s)]
*  And then he kind of ended up as director by happenstance, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1396.78s)]
*  as these things sometimes do during Watergate. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1399.26s)]
*  And so, and he had not been really involved. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1401.8999999999999s)]
*  He wasn't one of the inside club of like, you know, I see you got Dick Helms book, [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1403.66s)]
*  the man who kept the secret. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1407.66s)]
*  He was the kind of ultimate insider, Washington operator kind of. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1408.54s)]
*  My grandfather was out, unlike me, I'm more of a, you know, DC type policy type. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1411.74s)]
*  But I think he came in and he said, there's a chance that... [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1415.74s)]
*  I mean, remember this, the Democrats at the time, the congressional class of 1974, [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1419.98s)]
*  very left wing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1424.22s)]
*  A lot of them were thinking, let's just get rid of this place. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1425.4199999999998s)]
*  Let's get rid of the intelligence community. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1427.34s)]
*  And his view is like, that's not good for our country, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1428.6999999999998s)]
*  but it's not good that they're spying on Americans. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1431.58s)]
*  You know, I've gotten debates on some of these on Twitter sometimes about like, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1433.82s)]
*  whether the American government is funding some of the stuff, you know, in Europe or whatever, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1437.1799999999998s)]
*  NATO, blah, blah, blah, that's reverberating back into the American political system. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1441.34s)]
*  It's like, yeah, it's happened before, you know, right? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1444.3s)]
*  For a long time. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1447.58s)]
*  For a long time. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1448.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's like, it's not unreasonable. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1449.1s)]
*  And by the way, sunlight is the best disinfectant. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1450.62s)]
*  And by the way, who were some of the people who were opposed at that time? [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1454.22s)]
*  Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1456.6999999999998s)]
*  You know, they were opposed to any kind of Henry Kissinger, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1458.9399999999998s)]
*  any kind of accountability for the intelligence community. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1461.82s)]
*  And so that's how I look at it. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1463.98s)]
*  I think there's a real need for accountability, also in the professional military. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1465.4199999999998s)]
*  What is this going on with four star officers recently retired who have no political vetting? [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1469.4199999999998s)]
*  They haven't been elected dogcatcher, weighing in on extremely sensitive points on American... [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1476.54s)]
*  Calling one of the presidential candidates a fascist. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1483.02s)]
*  That is wildly inappropriate. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1485.9s)]
*  There needs to be a fundamental change. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1487.42s)]
*  First of all, it's wrong. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1488.8600000000001s)]
*  Second of all, it's not consistent with our constitutional order. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1490.8600000000001s)]
*  Remember that our founding fathers who had gone through the revolution, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1495.18s)]
*  who had fought a war against a great power and won, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1497.98s)]
*  they were like, the nasty politics is a feature. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1501.1000000000001s)]
*  Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson talking about each other's mother, fine. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1505.18s)]
*  Standing military? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1509.18s)]
*  Uh-uh. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1510.22s)]
*  We only built a serious standing military. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1511.02s)]
*  American military officers wore civilian clothes into the Pentagon as late as World War II, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1513.5s)]
*  maybe even after. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1518.94s)]
*  So we have come, this is since 1947 or since World War II, basically. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1520.3s)]
*  And I think we need it given what's happening, but it needs to be accountable. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1524.1399999999999s)]
*  The third point I would make about this group is like, where do they get off? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1527.5s)]
*  Like, has our military been successful? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1531.02s)]
*  Have our political military goals been achieved over the last 25 years? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1532.86s)]
*  You know... [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1537.1s)]
*  Call me when you win a war. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1537.58s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1538.62s)]
*  And by the way, most of that guilt goes towards the liberal primacist alliance, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1540.0600000000002s)]
*  the politicians who did it, yes. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1543.9s)]
*  But also the war leaders who, you know, for instance, H.R. McMaster wrote a book [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1546.22s)]
*  called Derelection of Duty about how the generals in Vietnam did not tell Lyndon Johnson [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1550.3000000000002s)]
*  they couldn't successfully prosecute that war. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1555.26s)]
*  Okay, I agree with you. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1556.94s)]
*  How is the senior military done? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1559.3400000000001s)]
*  So I think some humility, getting back to basics, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1561.02s)]
*  and staying out of politics is really needed. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1563.42s)]
*  It's infuriating. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1565.74s)]
*  It does challenge like the idea of our constitutional order. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1567.98s)]
*  I agree completely, but it's also ominous. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1572.3799999999999s)]
*  So when you read that the Pentagon now has a new policy [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1574.86s)]
*  where the direction of civilian leadership, they can kill Americans in the United States. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1577.6599999999999s)]
*  What is that? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1582.1399999999999s)]
*  Look, there's a lot of things that need to be taken a look at where like we have gotten, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1583.6599999999999s)]
*  especially after 9-11, where it's just metastasized, right? [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1587.4199999999998s)]
*  Where we need to ask ourselves, what is the right... [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1590.9399999999998s)]
*  And I think you've done this like commendably where you're saying, look, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1593.74s)]
*  I was here on this position here and I'm same thing. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1596.6200000000001s)]
*  Where like, you know, but look at the costs and people like, you know, who were, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1599.26s)]
*  we would say on the old new left would have said, oh my God, this is going to be abused. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1603.74s)]
*  And people like us were like, ah, don't worry about it. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1606.8600000000001s)]
*  And now they were right. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1608.7s)]
*  So let's take a new look at that. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1610.0600000000002s)]
*  Again, I think we need to have the capabilities. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1611.3400000000001s)]
*  But I also think this is where this group, I mean, practically speaking, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1614.46s)]
*  not only former, I mean, former CIA leaders implying that president Trump was a Russian agent [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1618.0600000000002s)]
*  is a wild abuse of the trust because it's a special trust with classified information [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1623.5s)]
*  and special authorities. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1628.46s)]
*  And it's almost like a religious obligation where there needs to be a self-discipline [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1629.8200000000002s)]
*  and an understanding that there's certain things you can't do, you know? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1634.3000000000002s)]
*  And that's been deeply violated. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1637.5800000000002s)]
*  And I think, frankly, Republicans agree that a lot of Democrats or independents or whatever [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1639.9s)]
*  voted for president Trump, they've delivered a verdict on this issue. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1646.3s)]
*  So I think you need people who have that balance, which to me is the American way is to say, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1649.1s)]
*  look, the people have spoken, this stuff got out of hand and we need to have a balance, [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1653.4199999999998s)]
*  but we need to preserve what we need for our security. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1658.94s)]
*  What do you do in Ukraine? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1663.1s)]
*  Well, one is I hope the president is successful and leans forward on his plan to end the war. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1665.02s)]
*  And I just say, I don't know what that is, but nobody knew what Dwight Eisenhower was [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1672.1399999999999s)]
*  talking about in 1952. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1675.5s)]
*  Nobody knew what Richard Nixon was talking about in 1968. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1676.7s)]
*  And nobody knew what Ronald Reagan was talking about in 1988. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1678.94s)]
*  You already see indications that players, including President Putin, might be changing [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1680.86s)]
*  and the Ukrainians for that matter. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1685.26s)]
*  So I hope there's a basis what exactly that looks like. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1686.62s)]
*  I don't think it, you know, you're not going to like liberate Crimea, right? [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1689.18s)]
*  That's obvious. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1692.78s)]
*  And the war's not going well. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1693.34s)]
*  I think that's step one. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1694.78s)]
*  And I think the Europeans need to, I mean, this is something I've been banging on. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1695.98s)]
*  It's just so common sense. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1699.1s)]
*  And by the way, you want to talk about who's helping. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1700.7s)]
*  Biden and Harris, you know, would go to Europe and say, you don't need to worry about anything. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1703.42s)]
*  But so would kind of primist type Republicans. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1707.18s)]
*  They would go to Europe and say, don't worry, we can do everything. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1709.5s)]
*  We're leading. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1711.74s)]
*  They didn't do the Europeans any favors. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1712.54s)]
*  They didn't do the Ukrainians any favors, let alone, you know, anybody else, let alone [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1714.22s)]
*  the American people, because they promised things they couldn't deliver. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1717.66s)]
*  And this is something where, you know, and I said this, I was Ross Douthat, we had an [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1720.22s)]
*  interview right before the election in the New York Times, you know, where I get, oh, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1725.58s)]
*  isn't it, and Ross didn't say this, but it was sort of like questioning the morality [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1728.86s)]
*  of what President Trump's saying. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1732.7s)]
*  I don't think there's been a stronger case, a more important time for foreign policy that [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1733.66s)]
*  is more moral than what you see, which is the moralism, which is all intention. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1739.9s)]
*  You see it on the left from Tony Blinken, just saying, oh, the Ukrainians are fighting [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1743.66s)]
*  for freedom, so we need to do X, Y, Z, and then failing. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1747.5s)]
*  The way I think about it is like, no, we need a foreign policy that's more like, how does [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1749.74s)]
*  a parent think about the responsibility of the child? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1752.7s)]
*  Or let's say you're on the board of an orphanage. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1754.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, you might have a really good guy. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1757.66s)]
*  He goes to church every Sunday. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1759.42s)]
*  Never cheats at cards or whatever, but he sucks at handling the money. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1761.6599999999999s)]
*  You know, you're going to hire a guy who's actually going to take care of the orphans. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1765.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1768.3s)]
*  And that is, and to me, that's- [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1768.6999999999998s)]
*  Well, by the way, if all the orphans die, it doesn't matter how much you love them. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1770.1399999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1773.74s)]
*  Or claim that you do. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1774.1399999999999s)]
*  You don't actually love them. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1775.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, of course you don't, because the purpose of a system is its effect. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1776.2199999999998s)]
*  And what's the effect of the war in Ukraine is to depopulate Ukraine and now to allow [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1779.82s)]
*  foreigners, including many Americans, including BlackRock, to buy the soil of Ukraine. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1786.22s)]
*  I mean, it's certainly not, whatever this has happened has definitely not been beneficial [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1792.06s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1795.58s)]
*  Well, the Ukrainians just lost Ukraine, but not to the Russians, but through the [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1795.66s)]
*  encouragement of the Biden administration. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1799.02s)]
*  That's my view of it. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1800.38s)]
*  But how close do you think we have come to a nuclear exchange with Russia during the [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1802.94s)]
*  last two decades? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1806.54s)]
*  I think it's close. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1806.7s)]
*  I mean, and Woodward for, you know, I mean, I'm not sure how reliable he is on everything, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1807.66s)]
*  but I think the reporting that the Biden administration, which was against interest, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1811.9s)]
*  was very worried about Russian nuclear employment in later 2022 is very, very concerning. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1816.38s)]
*  I think it was quite real. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1821.9s)]
*  And the people who are blithe and insouciant about it, I think is a incredibly irresponsible [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1823.26s)]
*  and should not be near serious decisions. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1827.98s)]
*  Who are those people? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1829.74s)]
*  Well, I think you see this kind of liberal primacy. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1830.6200000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of people who signed the no-fly zone or who made comments on Twitter or otherwise [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1832.7800000000002s)]
*  around that time and have said since have said, oh, you know, lift all the restrictions [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1838.46s)]
*  on the employment of U.S. forces. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1843.74s)]
*  And by the way, what's very clear is a lot of these people, if given the opportunity, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1845.1000000000001s)]
*  if they thought the political environment would bear it, would support direct intervention, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1848.46s)]
*  which if we go to war with the Russians directly, the Russians are very prepared to use nuclear [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1851.74s)]
*  weapons. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1857.1000000000001s)]
*  So we have to be realistic about what that entails. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1857.42s)]
*  What does that entail? [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1859.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think the Russians, one thing about Putin that's important, and again, like [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1860.7s)]
*  you don't have to like the person to understand that we need to take this guy seriously, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1867.1s)]
*  right, is he, you know, as he was, as he assumed power and took over from Yeltsin, which in [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1870.4599999999998s)]
*  the Russian mind was a catastrophically disastrous period. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1876.1399999999999s)]
*  One of the first things Putin invested in was the recapitalization of the Russian nuclear [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1879.34s)]
*  forces. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1883.82s)]
*  And the way Putin talks about Russian nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy indicates that [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1884.54s)]
*  he has a quite sophisticated understanding of nuclear strategy. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1889.26s)]
*  And of course, you know, a lot of it is speculation because thank God they've only been used once [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1892.3s)]
*  twice. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1896.78s)]
*  But it says to me, this guy's credible and he has an idea of how to use them. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1898.78s)]
*  You don't start by blowing up Washington, D.C. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1902.46s)]
*  You start potentially with something like battlefield use, selective strikes against [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1904.7s)]
*  things like places in Europe or more peripheral targets, but it can go up there and then you [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1909.26s)]
*  manipulate risk. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1913.34s)]
*  And if weapons are used in that way, you can see millions of people. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1914.3s)]
*  I mean, and we have almost no defense against that's why I think President Trump, for instance, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1918.3799999999999s)]
*  like having a better shield would be great. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1921.74s)]
*  But right now, we're pretty much denuded. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1923.5s)]
*  I just don't understand. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1927.1s)]
*  I mean, I guess it's kind of late in the game to whine about it, but we provided, you know, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1928.94s)]
*  a missile defense shield to another country, but we don't have one. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1933.5s)]
*  Like, how did that happen? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1936.62s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1938.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think that's something that we can work on. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1938.94s)]
*  I mean, it's technically very difficult, but I think having something better than what [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1942.94s)]
*  we have now. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1946.46s)]
*  We're always bragging about, you know, the use of the sophisticated use of our defensive [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1947.02s)]
*  missile technology abroad. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1951.42s)]
*  Did it occur to nobody that the purpose of the US military is to defend the United States? [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1954.22s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1957.82s)]
*  And by the way, up until the ABM Treaty was signed in the late 60s, you would go around [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1958.6200000000001s)]
*  American cities and there would be Nike Ajax and Nike Hercules, nuclear tipped missile [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1962.8600000000001s)]
*  defense interceptors and other kinds of NORAD and all these kinds of things. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1967.1s)]
*  So I think having a stronger defense of the American homeland makes sense. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1971.82s)]
*  And also, like, you know, people talk about the American military being used, you know, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1975.1s)]
*  in relation to Mexico. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1979.18s)]
*  It's like, well, I think Mexico is like, you know, and the immigration issue is very, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1980.22s)]
*  very complicated and everything. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1982.86s)]
*  But like, you know, the American military is to defend the United States, right? [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1984.2199999999998s)]
*  So like that should be, you know, so to me, the core missions of the American military [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1987.1799999999998s)]
*  that we're going to be focused on is defense the homeland, preventing China from becoming [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1991.4199999999998s)]
*  the hegemonic power in Asia, because I think we'll never re-industrialize, we'll never [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1995.26s)]
*  be autonomous and be what America needs to be if China dominates Asia. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=1998.3s)]
*  But I hope and think we can do that without a war, working with others that pull their [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2001.6599999999999s)]
*  own weight. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2005.5s)]
*  And then having an ability to make sure that we don't have a replication of 9-11. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2006.9399999999998s)]
*  Some of that is like being smarter about how we use our military. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2013.1s)]
*  But I think some of it is, you know, you got to keep tabs out there. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2016.6999999999998s)]
*  And then I think it's like about supporting allies. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2019.5s)]
*  People say Trump is anti-ally. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2021.4199999999998s)]
*  I think that's totally wrong. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2023.34s)]
*  It's just a different model of allies that's obviously, A, is much closer to the Cold War [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2024.2199999999998s)]
*  model and B, is common sense, is like part of it. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2028.1399999999999s)]
*  They say Trump is anti-ally. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2030.78s)]
*  So our, of course, most important ally in Europe is Germany. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2031.9799999999998s)]
*  Yes, which is totally. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2035.8999999999999s)]
*  And we just destroyed. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2037.74s)]
*  And so, but by the way, we had a direct hand. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2038.78s)]
*  This is not speculation. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2041.82s)]
*  I'm willing to say it's fact in blowing up Nord Stream. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2042.9399999999998s)]
*  So I know we're blaming the Ukrainians, but like we did that. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2046.22s)]
*  I'm just going to say that. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2049.5s)]
*  No, that's not true. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2050.86s)]
*  It is true. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2051.5s)]
*  So how exactly do we get to launch an act of industrial terrorism against our closest [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2052.2999999999997s)]
*  NATO ally? [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2057.2599999999998s)]
*  How is that allyship? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2058.38s)]
*  Well, the thing that's that's weird, and this gets, I think, also into the context of like [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2060.46s)]
*  who benefits, you know, Cui Bono, right? [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2065.18s)]
*  Is like, so since the Ukraine War broke out, the European economy and particularly the [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2067.5s)]
*  German economy has been like in free fall. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2072.3s)]
*  So there's this kind of cute argument for a while that we had somehow like benefited [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2073.98s)]
*  from Europe sucking air after the Ukraine War broke out. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2078.86s)]
*  I've heard many people say that. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2082.38s)]
*  And it's like, well, no, no, wait, hold on. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2083.58s)]
*  Our point, if you go back to like Dwight Eisenhower and like Common Sense is like, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2085.1s)]
*  no, we want them to stand on our two feet. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2088.46s)]
*  Like I don't get a rise out of lording it over the Europeans. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2089.98s)]
*  This is sort of this mindset that like. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2093.5s)]
*  Well, this is still fundamentally a European country. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2095.9s)]
*  This was a European colony. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2097.98s)]
*  So Europe is basically allied with the United States on a very fundamental level, or certainly [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2099.5s)]
*  has been for 250 years. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2103.7400000000002s)]
*  So destroying Europe. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2104.94s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2107.42s)]
*  With some exceptions. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2108.1400000000003s)]
*  But in general, you fight with the people closest to you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2108.94s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2111.7400000000002s)]
*  But I mean, like Christian Europe, right? [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2112.54s)]
*  It's basically our ally and destroying Western Europe, which I think we've done. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2115.98s)]
*  How does that help us? [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2121.26s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2122.06s)]
*  I don't think that it's. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2123.02s)]
*  I mean, the interesting thing about that is, I mean, you know, obviously we're, you know, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2123.98s)]
*  settled, you know, originally by Europeans. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2127.34s)]
*  Now we have people coming from all over the world, et cetera. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2129.02s)]
*  But the thing is, actually, if you look back at our early history, we stayed out of Europe. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2130.86s)]
*  Well, I know we were actually more involved in the Western Hemisphere, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2134.7s)]
*  particularly the Caribbean and Asia, actually. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2138.14s)]
*  So people say, oh, you know, you never we're never going to get focused on Asia. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2140.62s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2143.34s)]
*  Who opened the Black, who the Black ships opened Japan? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2144.22s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2146.62s)]
*  People were trading a lot of the early American fortunes. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2147.1s)]
*  You know, the Peabody Essex Museum and Salem. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2149.26s)]
*  That was China, right? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2151.9s)]
*  People trading in Canton, sometimes with opium, you know, and then like Samoa, Hawaii, et cetera. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2153.5s)]
*  So I'm not saying like we have we have a strong interest in Europe. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2158.86s)]
*  Philippines. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2161.5s)]
*  The Philippines, of course. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2162.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2163.18s)]
*  In fact, my great grandfather, we were talking about our families like I [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2164.7s)]
*  he was an army officer in the interwar period and he was stationed at the American. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2168.54s)]
*  There was like a concession in China, not China's proudest period. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2172.22s)]
*  But, you know, we were we were present. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2174.94s)]
*  So what that what I think that means to me is a couple of things. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2177.1s)]
*  One, if you actually go back to American history at our best and really kind of, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2179.9s)]
*  you know, the first got really until 1989, we did pretty well with the exception, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2185.82s)]
*  I think, to things like Vietnam and stuff like that. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2189.82s)]
*  But it was pretty hard nosed. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2192.14s)]
*  Like you go back to Washington's farewell address, Hamilton, et cetera. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2193.42s)]
*  It's like we're looking after number one. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2196.94s)]
*  So this idea that America first is somehow inconsistent. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2198.46s)]
*  It's like, by the way, a republic is supposed to be in the interests of everybody, right? [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2201.34s)]
*  Like that's the definition. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2206.38s)]
*  So when people say Trump is transactional, I'm like, good, right? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2207.9s)]
*  We need to he's like the, you know, the CEO of America and the board is saying, [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2211.1s)]
*  hey, look after our interests, right? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2215.9s)]
*  That's actually what you want. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2217.98s)]
*  And then on Europe, it's like we don't actually benefit. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2219.34s)]
*  I mean, it's been a disaster. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2222.06s)]
*  I think objectively, the policy of the last two and a half years in particular [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2223.5s)]
*  has been a total disaster. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2226.94s)]
*  Germany is in real economic straits. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2228.22s)]
*  The Ukrainians are losing the war. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2230.22s)]
*  They haven't built up their military. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2231.8199999999997s)]
*  But, you know, hey, Joe Biden got a medal from Olaf Schultz, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2233.42s)]
*  who's probably going to be out of a job as well. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2235.98s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2237.7400000000002s)]
*  In a few months, for their sake. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2238.22s)]
*  I mean, I don't believe in like intervening. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2239.9s)]
*  Apparently the Europeans, Schultz himself, feel free to intervene in our politics. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2242.3s)]
*  Schultz endorsed Biden. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2245.98s)]
*  Do your job. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2248.06s)]
*  I was at the Republican convention as you were a couple months ago, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2249.02s)]
*  and I was getting lectured by a few members of the Bundestag, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2251.58s)]
*  the German Congress equivalent, conservatives, putative conservatives. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2253.9s)]
*  And they were like, why can't you do what Reagan did? [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2258.14s)]
*  And I said, you know what? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2259.5s)]
*  There's some problems with that, et cetera, like great debt to GDP, our military. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2260.62s)]
*  How about you start out by spending as much on defense as the American people do? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2264.22s)]
*  Like, why don't our like that? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2268.86s)]
*  That to me is like what President Trump and against the whole foreign policy establishment. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2270.46s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2274.14s)]
*  Because the foreign policy establishment likes the dependency model. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2274.54s)]
*  Of course. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2277.74s)]
*  They like the welfare model in the United States. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2278.86s)]
*  They want people in public housing. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2281.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2282.62s)]
*  And that's what I've said to the Europeans. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2282.86s)]
*  And it's part of my message to the Europeans is like, hey, it's not just your fault. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2284.14s)]
*  I'm not just castigating you as responsible you are. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2286.86s)]
*  It's also our fault, especially our establishment. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2289.18s)]
*  But if you look at the message from the American people, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2291.26s)]
*  it's we don't want more of that establishment. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2293.82s)]
*  And that's again why it's so important to have the right policies and vision. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2295.98s)]
*  Well, we've got the vision. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2300.2200000000003s)]
*  The question now is implementation. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2301.0200000000004s)]
*  So the problems for the President-elect are the same as they were in the first administration, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2302.1400000000003s)]
*  I would say. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2308.2200000000003s)]
*  How do you staff this thing with people who are aligned with you? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2308.78s)]
*  And how do you keep the people who presently occupy every position of power, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2311.82s)]
*  who operate the levers of power, how do you keep them from wrecking the project? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2316.0600000000004s)]
*  Secretly. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2321.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2322.14s)]
*  And the thing that's different is that the international situation [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2322.86s)]
*  that he's being left with is truly dire. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2326.06s)]
*  And so there's no room for, you know, kind of like, you know, sort of delay or... [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2329.1s)]
*  There's no... [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2335.74s)]
*  I'm sorry, I don't want to start attacking people, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2336.86s)]
*  but I just know everybody as I know you do. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2339.02s)]
*  They have... [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2342.14s)]
*  No, no, I mean, the people who want these jobs in the second Trump administration, [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2342.86s)]
*  and there's no... [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2349.34s)]
*  They act like it's 1985. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2350.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the thing, isn't it? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2352.46s)]
*  They have not updated their files. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2353.1800000000003s)]
*  These are the dumbest people I think I've ever met. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2354.46s)]
*  Vivek has been great on this. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2355.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2357.34s)]
*  In the debate when he said to Pence in 1983... [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2357.6600000000003s)]
*  Why shouldn't he be Secretary of State, by the way? [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2359.1800000000003s)]
*  I think Vivek would be an amazing... [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2360.7000000000003s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2362.3s)]
*  I mean, he's there. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2362.6200000000003s)]
*  He was out hustling for the President. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2363.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, he's... [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2365.34s)]
*  I mean, we all say, you know what time it is, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2366.6200000000003s)]
*  but he like delivered these memorable lines against Pence in that debate. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2368.1400000000003s)]
*  And then he debated John Bolton, I think at VMI. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2372.38s)]
*  And it was just like, it was a very human point. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2374.94s)]
*  I saw the segment where he's just like, you grew up... [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2376.7s)]
*  And this being generous, honestly, to John Bolton, frankly, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2379.2599999999998s)]
*  which I admired Vivek on that point, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2381.8999999999996s)]
*  but he said, you grew up in the era of Apollo 11. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2384.06s)]
*  And I grew up in the era, and he's younger than I am, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2387.4199999999996s)]
*  the global financial crisis, Iraq, failed wars, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2389.3399999999997s)]
*  increasingly fractious society, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2393.4199999999996s)]
*  And it's like, you know, nobody... [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2395.74s)]
*  There's a friend of mine who was interviewed in one of these stories [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2397.3399999999997s)]
*  about the new right and so forth. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2400.7799999999997s)]
*  And he said, nobody under the age of 30, I know, is a conservative, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2401.8999999999996s)]
*  treats the new conservative idea with anything but derision and scorn, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2404.78s)]
*  something like that. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2407.5800000000004s)]
*  And it was just like, I'm confident where things are heading, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2408.46s)]
*  but we don't have time because if China... [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2411.6600000000003s)]
*  Like, and I'm not a fanatic on China, right? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2413.34s)]
*  Like my view on China is, and I think the Chinese understand this. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2415.7400000000002s)]
*  My view is we need to be strong, but we also need, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2419.82s)]
*  like in the Cold War, there's like a line and there's, we don't cross it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2422.94s)]
*  And we need to be able to decouple the thing, you know, [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2426.3s)]
*  re-industrialize things, Lighthizer and Navarro, and so on, are talking about, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2429.34s)]
*  which is bring back industry, have more autonomy. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2432.86s)]
*  But at the same time, you know, there's a line, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2435.7400000000002s)]
*  but we're not going to go in regime change. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2437.98s)]
*  There are people who served in the first Trump administration, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2439.5800000000004s)]
*  who are talking about regime change in China, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2441.82s)]
*  who are talking about primacy over China, like dominating China. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2443.7400000000002s)]
*  Like that is so dangerous. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2446.78s)]
*  And often they're the same people who are supporting, you know, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2448.86s)]
*  total support of Ukraine, which is like make zero sense, like zero sense, right? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2452.38s)]
*  So my view is you got to do the things you're talking about, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2456.7000000000003s)]
*  but you've also got to say we got to, and you know, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2460.3s)]
*  Senator Vance has made, Vice President-elect Vance has made these points very well. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2462.6200000000003s)]
*  Re-industrialization is critical, but it's going to take some time. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2465.82s)]
*  In the meantime, given that the Biden team has used up so much of our weaponry and so forth, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2468.2200000000003s)]
*  we got a husband what we have. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2472.3s)]
*  And again, to me, that is with the purpose of not getting into wars. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2473.9s)]
*  So every year when Apple releases the overpriced new iPhone, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2479.02s)]

*  How could Four Stars, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2564.46s)]
*  how could the leadership of the Pentagon support this? [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2567.66s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2571.18s)]
*  I think, again, maybe I'm too optimistic, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2572.46s)]
*  but I dealt with a lot of Four Stars when I was there. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2575.18s)]
*  When you worked with the Pentagon? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2579.66s)]
*  When I worked with the Pentagon, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2580.14s)]
*  because the thing about my job, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2580.8599999999997s)]
*  my formal title was a little bit kind of middle, upper middle tier, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2582.7s)]
*  but basically I was running the strategy. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2585.8999999999996s)]
*  So I had a lot of exposure. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2587.5s)]
*  I was kind of operating above the sort of normal level. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2588.62s)]
*  I got a lot of experience, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2592.54s)]
*  and I've stayed in touch with these people. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2593.5s)]
*  I watch them. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2594.62s)]
*  Here's the thing, and Kissinger, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2596.06s)]
*  I don't think was that great of a statesman, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2597.8999999999996s)]
*  but I think he was a brilliant writer and sort of observer. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2599.1s)]
*  He said something like, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2602.54s)]
*  big strategic shifts don't take place just by acts of virtuosity. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2603.58s)]
*  They reflect underlying trends. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2606.94s)]
*  And I think you talk to people in the military, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2608.86s)]
*  and I keep in touch with a lot of them. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2611.74s)]
*  They know, what I'm saying is like common sense for military people. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2612.86s)]
*  They know our readiness is down. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2615.66s)]
*  They know our defense industrial base is in trouble. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2616.7799999999997s)]
*  They know the Chinese are moving like gangbusters. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2618.7s)]
*  They know the Russians aren't a joke. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2620.7s)]
*  They know we can't afford to get into another big Middle Eastern war. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2622.14s)]
*  So if you show at the top level clarity and courage, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2624.94s)]
*  as President Trump has in charting the direction, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2628.2999999999997s)]
*  and he has people under him who are genuinely trying [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2630.7799999999997s)]
*  to put that into place, I think if you build it, they will come. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2633.1s)]
*  And here's the other thing, bear in mind that since 2008, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2635.74s)]
*  the Democrats have been in control almost the whole time. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2639.5s)]
*  And under before that, it was the Iraq War group. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2641.42s)]
*  So a lot of the people who've made it to the top of a very flat pyramid, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2644.54s)]
*  they know how to like, here's the thing about the military. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2647.66s)]
*  And you look at people like John Kelly being out there, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2650.46s)]
*  you know, moralizing and calling President Trump a fascist, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2652.7s)]
*  which is like absurd and inappropriate and terrible on its face. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2654.94s)]
*  But it's also like the military, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2657.8199999999997s)]
*  we should respect military service. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2659.9s)]
*  I certainly do, especially people in combat and so forth. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2661.74s)]
*  But you know, the military, there's careerism, there's promotion, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2664.7799999999997s)]
*  people looking after their own interests, etc. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2667.66s)]
*  The people at the top of the pyramid often are people who have [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2669.9799999999996s)]
*  satisfied the criteria for promotion and selection. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2673.2599999999998s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2676.06s)]
*  You know, people respond to incentives, [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2676.9399999999996s)]
*  but it is the most ruthless selection process. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2678.4599999999996s)]
*  And bear in mind, talk about the Republic, the Army, the Navy, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2682.3799999999997s)]
*  and the Marine Corps predate the Constitution. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2685.9799999999996s)]
*  So these are very deeply embedded institutions. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2688.4599999999996s)]
*  People live their entire adult lives in them [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2690.3s)]
*  if they get to be a four star. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2692.0600000000004s)]
*  So you just got like, again, going to like a new left thing. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2693.34s)]
*  You look at it sociologically, you're like, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2696.46s)]
*  this is going to have some pathologies. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2698.1400000000003s)]
*  Obviously, it's a really important institution, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2699.82s)]
*  but you got to like, but I think at the end of the day, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2701.9s)]
*  this is going to have some pathologies. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2704.7000000000003s)]
*  Nicely put. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2706.78s)]
*  There are people in there who want to do the right thing, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2708.38s)]
*  you know, or they can be motivated to do the right thing. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2710.94s)]
*  That's fantastic people in the military. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2713.6600000000003s)]
*  And if they're rewarded for it, they will go, they will get, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2715.82s)]
*  because a lot of the guys who would have wanted to do that, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2719.1s)]
*  they cash out as a Colonel or a Navy captain or a one star, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2720.7s)]
*  you know, but if we put the, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2723.98s)]
*  President Trump and his team, I should say, [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2728.06s)]
*  they put the right incentives. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2729.66s)]
*  I think it'll get better. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2730.94s)]
*  I must say, it's just having spent my life in DC [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2732.46s)]
*  and just running into them a lot or living near them. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2734.38s)]
*  It was always so noticeable. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2736.7s)]
*  I met so many bright, energetic, wise, I would say, Colonel's. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2738.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2743.58s)]
*  But far, you know, I can think of one Marine, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2744.7s)]
*  two star I knew Marine general who I thought was so impressive. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2747.42s)]
*  I'll even say his name, Vinnie Colonese, wonderful man. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2751.26s)]
*  But, you know, didn't meet a lot of other flag officers [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2755.1s)]
*  that I thought were anything other than politicians. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2758.38s)]
*  I think, I think- [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2761.66s)]
*  I'm sure they exist. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2762.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I think, I think real, I'll put it this way. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2763.5s)]
*  Most of the real, there's some brilliant defense guys. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2766.62s)]
*  I'll mention a Democrat I have a lot of respect for, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2769.98s)]
*  Bob Work, who served in the Pentagon, he's a great guy, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2772.46s)]
*  he was a Marine Colonel, retired. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2774.3s)]
*  Andrew Krepenevich, who was another brilliant guy, an Army guy, retired Colonel. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2776.7799999999997s)]
*  Often the guys who are really the highest horsepower, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2781.58s)]
*  real strategic thinkers, they cash out at that level [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2785.1s)]
*  because that's what the selection is for. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2787.74s)]
*  It's not to say that other people aren't aren't smart, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2789.74s)]
*  but like the people that, you know, there's- [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2791.8199999999997s)]
*  It's so noticeable. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2794.14s)]
*  And there's a mismatch between how people think like, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2795.1s)]
*  oh, you know, he has four stars, ergo, he's like a strategic genius. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2798.22s)]
*  No, no, that's not how the selection process works. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2802.94s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2805.2599999999998s)]
*  They're promoted for like running a large, a corps, an Army corps, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2806.62s)]
*  you know, or a fleet. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2810.4599999999996s)]
*  That's different than, that's fine, but let's understand what we're dealing with. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2811.66s)]
*  But shouldn't the process, isn't the point of promotion to, you know, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2814.7s)]
*  win them out the less capable and elevate the most capable? [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2819.74s)]
*  Depends on what you're selecting for. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2822.22s)]
*  Well, I guess that's it. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2823.8199999999997s)]
*  But I think, hey, how about selecting for winning? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2824.8599999999997s)]
*  You know? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2829.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, hey. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2830.2999999999997s)]
*  Like, I think that as opposed to like, you know, kind of like [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2831.1s)]
*  playing the game and saying the right things. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2834.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, we don't know. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2837.8999999999996s)]
*  That's the other thing about like, you know, I love the meme [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2838.7s)]
*  of Mark Milley and Eisenhower and their chests. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2841.58s)]
*  Like, I just, it's so perfect. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2845.02s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2846.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, it's just, it's just, you could speak for 10 hours and you're not- [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2846.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, when I watched Milley in that famous, now famous hearing talking about white rage, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2849.8999999999996s)]
*  I thought this is a guy who doesn't have any idea what he's talking about. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2854.62s)]
*  He's saying words he thinks he's supposed to say. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2858.2999999999997s)]
*  Doesn't seem terribly bright. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2861.8199999999997s)]
*  He seems weak above all. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2863.1s)]
*  He seems like the product of a bureaucracy to me, which probably shouldn't surprise me. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2864.46s)]
*  And I think there's, and again, to this pathology point, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2867.98s)]
*  you know, like if you read McMaster's memoirs, for instance, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2873.58s)]
*  he's almost kind of lecturing the American people about their need to like double defense spending [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2876.86s)]
*  and stay in Afghanistan until the second coming. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2880.78s)]
*  And it's like, it's that touch grass kind of thing where like you don't have political [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2882.86s)]
*  accountability, like direct, I mean, for instance, they not only they're not elected, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2886.86s)]
*  but people who are civilian appointees go through political vetting. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2890.38s)]
*  So they have a kind of indirect political accountability, you know, where the elect, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2893.02s)]
*  you have to demonstrate loyalty and, you know, you're on the team, et cetera. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2897.02s)]
*  You have to be aware of that. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2900.7s)]
*  The military, they really don't have that sensibly, although I wonder about the left [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2901.82s)]
*  and kind of through the back door, importing some of those things. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2906.22s)]
*  But so you get to this point where you think that you're like, well, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2909.58s)]
*  I'm speaking in front of a large group of people because I'm a four-star general. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2912.7s)]
*  And it's like, actually, you really have no standing to talk about that issue at all, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2915.74s)]
*  you know, because that's a domestic issue that you like don't have any political [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2920.62s)]
*  finger feel for. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2924.7s)]
*  And you're supposed to be much more careful and modest about that anyway. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2925.74s)]
*  They have no moral authority, right, to speak about anything like that because they have [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2929.2599999999998s)]
*  no authority apart from that granted them by the president. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2933.74s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2936.8599999999997s)]
*  Because we have civilian control and the president's authority comes from voters. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2937.42s)]
*  Right. And by the way, if somebody has authority, it's like the Audie Murphy guy, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2940.38s)]
*  the guys that you talking to who are like out there in the field, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2944.46s)]
*  Fallujah or whatever, they have authority. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2947.18s)]
*  You know, but I'm always like, you know, another guy, Frank McKenzie, who's out there a lot, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2949.58s)]
*  who's constantly hammering these points. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2953.2599999999998s)]
*  And I was like, well, he was the centcom commander when the Afghanistan withdrawal happened. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2955.2599999999998s)]
*  And he didn't put his stars on the, you know, if he thought there was a better way, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2959.98s)]
*  why didn't he put his stars on the table? [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2963.02s)]
*  So like, why are, you know, like, okay, I mean, I personally support the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2964.94s)]
*  I believe President Trump still does, but it said that it's done terribly. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2969.34s)]
*  And that, which I think is clear. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2973.1s)]
*  But it's like, you know, you could, you could say Dwight Eisenhower had a kind of moral authority. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2974.62s)]
*  The other thing about Dwight Eisenhower, I mean, he was actually a smart guy. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2979.42s)]
*  But if you look at like his Guildhall speech, I don't know if you remember this, but like [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2981.8199999999997s)]
*  the, unlike MacArthur, for instance, he had a real feel for the American people, civilian army, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2986.46s)]
*  you know, like they were, they were offering the, the award of the city of London. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2992.7s)]
*  He said, I can't accept this. I accept this only on behalf of the great human forces. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=2998.62s)]
*  He said, you know, which is like, yeah, it's like regular guys, you know, and that's, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3002.62s)]
*  to me, that's, I try to have that mindset about like, I don't want people to get torn limb from limb [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3007.58s)]
*  in a war with China that we could avoid, let alone another, like, or eviscerate vapor, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3012.62s)]
*  vaporized in a nuclear explosion with Russia. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3017.74s)]
*  Of course, that means you don't just like do whatever they want, duh. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3021.02s)]
*  But you've got to like calibrate that balance, always thinking about, as President Trump has said, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3024.22s)]
*  going back to like, what's in the concrete interest of the American people? [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3029.66s)]
*  You've referred repeatedly to a potential war with China. I assume that would be over Taiwan. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3032.62s)]
*  I think, yes, I think Taiwan would be the focal point, but what I think is very scary about the [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3041.5s)]
*  Chinese, and I don't think the Chinese are behaving in it. Frankly, if you apply the way, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3045.98s)]
*  like you were in Washington from the period after the collapse of the Soviet Union, right? Or a [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3050.7799999999997s)]
*  little bit after, right? But like- No, I was there, I was there that day. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3053.9s)]
*  You were there that day? Okay. Oh, right, exactly. I know you've talked about this. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3056.7799999999997s)]
*  Because if you apply the same kind of behavior that we exhibited over the 25, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3059.5s)]
*  say 20 years after that, and you apply that model to a China that is not constrained, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3066.78s)]
*  that's very scary, right? Like, so we just have to apply the same model to them. Because again, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3072.22s)]
*  to me, it's like a conservative, and I don't think- [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3078.06s)]
*  So I know exactly what you're saying, but maybe that's too subtle. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3079.82s)]
*  Yeah, we explained precisely what you're saying. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3085.18s)]
*  We went from being in the 1980s, you had the Weinberger Doctrine or President Reagan, and [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3087.26s)]
*  Reagan almost getting impeached because he was trying to help just a proxy group with the [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3092.0600000000004s)]
*  Contras, because people were so afraid of getting in another Vietnam. And the biggest thing that he [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3096.86s)]
*  would do would have meetings with the Soviet Premier on nuclear weapons, because people were like, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3102.0600000000004s)]
*  this could happen, and I really don't want it to happen, right? Fast forward 15 years, and we're [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3107.1000000000004s)]
*  invading Iraq, and as you recall, the people who were biggest fans of invading Iraq, the plan was [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3113.5s)]
*  also to go after probably Syria and Iran and so forth, informally or not. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3118.62s)]
*  I worked for those people at the time. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3123.02s)]
*  Okay, so you know. So, I mean, that was just the starting point. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3124.78s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware, yeah. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3127.66s)]
*  So, and the way- [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3129.02s)]
*  That was the new American century. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3129.9s)]
*  The way I interpret that is you're going to have people like that, because we're human beings, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3131.5s)]
*  and that's how we socialize or whatever. And if there's no constraint, no, you would have been [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3136.38s)]
*  sent to the loony bin in 1982. If you're like, oh, let's invade Iraq, 2003. If you said we [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3140.7s)]
*  shouldn't invade Iraq, you were like, even if you were Brent Scowcroft, you were castigated. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3145.66s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3149.18s)]
*  Right? So- [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3149.74s)]
*  And never rehabilitated, by the way. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3151.18s)]
*  Interesting. Well, I don't agree with him on everything, but I mean, that's sort of- [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3153.1s)]
*  I agree, but I'm just saying- [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3157.58s)]
*  No, exactly, yeah. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3158.7s)]
*  It wasn't like Brent Scowcroft got rich or more respect. I mean, he said those things [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3159.74s)]
*  to his own detriment. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3167.74s)]
*  Yeah. And just on the China thing, what I would say is they care a lot about Taiwan, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3169.3399999999997s)]
*  but I think it's very clear. They're building a military to go beyond Taiwan. They're building [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3173.8199999999997s)]
*  a basing architecture to go well beyond Taiwan. I think that's, in a sense, almost indisputable. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3177.58s)]
*  And I think they have interests to go beyond Taiwan. This is what worries me is I actually fear, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3182.2999999999997s)]
*  ironically, that China is living out the Leninist theory of imperialism, which is they need [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3188.3799999999997s)]
*  captive export markets for their overproduction. And of course, they need natural resources and [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3194.46s)]
*  other things to import. And so they have a rational incentive to what the Japanese created, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3199.58s)]
*  the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Every empire, formal or informal, is- not everyone, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3203.66s)]
*  but a lot of them start out as basically commercial zones. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3209.26s)]
*  Of course. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3211.82s)]
*  And that's what I worry about. And again, the good news is I think we can negotiate with China [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3212.3s)]
*  about that. That's why I think President Trump's, against a lot of criticism, his willingness [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3216.62s)]
*  to be open to negotiating a deal with President Xi is good because we don't have an implacable [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3221.98s)]
*  hostility or rivalry. We don't have to change- I hate communism, but that's up to them. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3229.42s)]
*  The last thing I want is Americans dying, trying to impose our form of government on them. Hopefully, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3236.54s)]
*  that's pretty uncontroversial. But I think if we just- Taiwan's a tough issue because the point [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3241.1s)]
*  I've been making, and I've gotten some flack from, again, good quarters from the Wall Street Journal, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3247.26s)]
*  last couple of months, is like, I've been saying we should focus on defending Taiwan, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3252.06s)]
*  and they need to step up. They haven't done it, and we haven't prioritized. So I think Taiwan is [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3255.58s)]
*  on the knife's edge right now. Now, I think we want to avoid a war over that if we possibly can. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3259.1800000000003s)]
*  And President Trump has said an attack on Taiwan isn't going to happen under my watch. So I think [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3263.26s)]
*  it is absolutely incumbent upon whoever is working for him to make sure that doesn't happen, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3267.98s)]
*  combining a strong shield with a rational defensive policy and kind of political message [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3273.1800000000003s)]
*  to China that convinces them that, look, you're better off with peace. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3279.98s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal attacked you? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3286.38s)]
*  Yeah. So they- [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3287.66s)]
*  How long will the Wall Street Journal kind of be considered the preeminent place where, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3289.18s)]
*  quote, conservative intellectuals explain their views? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3293.42s)]
*  I think they're actually in trouble, honestly. I read them, but they are so far out of whack. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3296.78s)]
*  I mean, so on the national security foreign policy issues, they are total premises. In the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3303.18s)]
*  same breath, often they'll say, our military is in terrible shape, but we need to have aggressive [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3308.94s)]
*  policies in four different theaters. It makes no sense. It's incoherent. They're way out of step [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3312.78s)]
*  on the conservative Republican views on trade, where Lighthizer and Navarro and the President are. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3318.86s)]
*  They can't stand- They've been repeatedly criticized people like you, like Vice President [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3324.54s)]
*  Vance, so I feel like I'm honored to be in this company. So it's sort of like, obviously, they [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3329.5s)]
*  reflect a certain part of the American population, which is sort of wealthier professionals [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3334.46s)]
*  who are probably more socially liberal, the Acela corridor in New York, et cetera. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3341.18s)]
*  But I think a lot of people read them because they matter, right? But at some point, you get so far [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3344.7s)]
*  out of whack that you actually become a liability. And they were big backers of Nikki Haley and so [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3348.94s)]
*  forth. But then with the rise of new media, I mean, you've been a pioneer in this, but others, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3353.02s)]
*  and Elon and what he's done with X and David Sacks and these kinds of people, I think there's [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3360.7s)]
*  hope that not only does it not going to matter as much, but it may become less and less relevant. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3367.18s)]
*  It seems like the Drudge report to me, you have in your mind that this- No, I mean, Drudge went from- [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3371.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3378.4599999999996s)]
*  Drudge was, of course, sold to left-wingers. They've never admitted that, but I believe that's true. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3378.8599999999997s)]
*  But the Wall Street Journal in some sense has been also, I mean, they don't, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3384.54s)]
*  I don't know, people who imagine the Wall Street Journal is conservative or sort of like haven't [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3389.18s)]
*  been paying attention. It's like the socially liberal fiscal conservative. Yeah. And they were [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3393.42s)]
*  like mocking President Trump in the interview. I thought that was pretty lame and kind of gross. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3397.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a really dishonest newspaper and I'm rooting for its demise. I just want to say that. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3400.7799999999997s)]
*  I hope it could get reformed, but you know, I'm- [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3406.7799999999997s)]
*  You're right. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3409.1s)]
*  You're totally right. We've seen enough institutions destroyed. I just, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3410.14s)]
*  I do think it's really a garbage newspaper and I wish more people realized that. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3413.8999999999996s)]
*  I can't control myself. Sorry. Out of control. So when do you think it'll be clear like who's [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3420.2999999999997s)]
*  administering Trump's foreign policy? I mean, I just, I honestly don't know. I mean, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3429.66s)]
*  it's obviously up to him. But, you know, what I would say is I hope he makes, you know, picks [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3434.46s)]
*  people who will implement the vision that he ran on and that, you know, you and others have supported [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3442.38s)]
*  him so ably about just as sincerely as an American. I mean, even if I'm not part of it or I'm dog [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3447.7400000000002s)]
*  catcher or whatever, I mean that I think if honestly, if the primacist types who could get [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3453.18s)]
*  us into multiple wars get in there, you're going to have to get to a more realistic [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3460.54s)]
*  foreign policy eventually. Well, they'll destroy Trump. Just to be clear, people like Pompeo, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3465.42s)]
*  whom I know personally, hate Trump. They hate Trump. And, you know, I don't care what he says [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3470.7799999999997s)]
*  or Lindsey Graham says, oh, he's so great. You know, they suck up to him on Fox news, but they [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3476.7799999999997s)]
*  hate him and they're working to undermine him. And they did throughout his four years in office and [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3480.54s)]
*  the four years that followed, they undermined him because they hate him. So I just hope that [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3485.58s)]
*  there is a new generation in the Republican party of people who maybe aren't even ideological, but [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3492.7s)]
*  just put America's interests is the whole point of our government. I think there is a new generation, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3497.8199999999997s)]
*  people in their twenties and thirties. I'm very hopeful. I mean, I talk to a lot of them. What [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3505.02s)]
*  I'm worried about is I don't think there's any, I mean, you maybe like, and well, Trump is like an [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3508.7s)]
*  exception, but you know, you look at a guy like vice president Vance, he's only, I think 40. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3513.1s)]
*  Yes. You know, a lot of the best senators, you know, are much younger. Yes. You look like Eric [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3517.42s)]
*  Schmidt. Eric Schmidt is amazing. Jim Banks, you know, younger guys, like, you know, and the problem [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3522.46s)]
*  is people just naturally like, well, we need somebody who's 65 or whatever. And it's sort of [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3528.06s)]
*  like, but I think it's even worse than what you're suggesting because like, you know, let's say we [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3532.06s)]
*  get in a big Middle Eastern war and you have people who are talking about an independent Taiwan [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3536.38s)]
*  or regime change in China or regime change in Russia. And we get bogged down. Why wouldn't the [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3541.74s)]
*  Chinese attack? Like just, I mean, the thinking about, think apply how we behaved, the project [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3547.4199999999996s)]
*  for new American century style thinking, and just think that those people will be in the ascendancy [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3551.66s)]
*  in Beijing. The way I think about it Tucker is like, we're like a heavyweight boxer and China's [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3556.22s)]
*  another heavyweight boxer. Russia's like a middleweight and maybe North Korea and Iran are like, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3561.66s)]
*  you know, welterweights or featherweights or whatever. Those guys can, they can tear you out [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3566.4599999999996s)]
*  and China can call us to a match at any time, at any time. And if we're not ready, that is like [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3570.7s)]
*  terrible, you know? And so at that point, we would have to put a more realistic foreign policy, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3576.8599999999997s)]
*  but on my view, and this is, I think a real point to the kind of people read the Wall Street Journal [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3583.02s)]
*  on bed page. The point that I would make to them is if we go down this path of aggressive policies [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3587.66s)]
*  in three or four different theaters of the world without the backing, we will end up bloody and [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3595.3399999999997s)]
*  bruised. We will have catastrophic defeat. Lots of Americans will be killed and the American people [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3599.98s)]
*  may very well say, I'm done. I'm done. This is, you know, all the rules based international order. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3604.94s)]
*  This is what it led to. Forget about it. And that if you want to save it, if you want to save [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3610.46s)]
*  something, like I think, I think mine is like the reform rather than the radical upheaval. Mine is [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3615.58s)]
*  like, Hey, no, I believe in the post-war. I just don't believe in the post 1989 absurd hubris going [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3621.42s)]
*  around. The people, yeah, we can have the Cold War. And I keep going back to it. But just like, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3628.06s)]
*  I just tried because like, you know, Senator McConnell will talk about Eisenhower all the time. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3632.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, Eisenhower thought that if there were US troops in Europe at the end of the 1950s, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3635.58s)]
*  it was a failure. He's the one who came up with the Uncle Sucker line, not President Trump. So you want [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3640.06s)]
*  to talk about the Cold War legacy. We were pretty ruthless. You know, the Germans attacked us or [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3644.7s)]
*  excuse me, this sounds like John Belushi. The Japanese attacked us in 1941. And we let the Soviets [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3648.7799999999997s)]
*  do the bulk of the fighting. And we put Germany first. Why? Because, and I'm glad as a descendant [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3653.82s)]
*  of people who are in the European theater of operations, I'm glad that the Soviets, but [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3658.46s)]
*  George Schultz, when he went and dealt with his counterpart, he went, he visited, he wrote about [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3662.54s)]
*  this very movingly. He went to the cemetery in Leningrad and he offered a somber salute. And I [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3666.86s)]
*  had the honor to meet Schultz a couple of times. And this was not a, you know, he's had strong [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3672.38s)]
*  views and so forth. But I think you can respect that, you know, and understand that we can be hard [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3676.6200000000003s)]
*  noses and look at your opponents and say, we don't want a war. We've told you before about [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3682.86s)]
*  Hallow. It is a great app that I am proud to say I use, my whole family uses. It's for daily prayer [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3689.1s)]
*  and Christian meditation. And it's transformative. So with everything happening in the world right [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3695.5s)]
*  now, it is essential to ground yourself. This is not some quack cure. This is the oldest and most [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3701.1800000000003s)]
*  reliable cure in history. It's rare. Ground yourself in prayer and scripture every single day. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3710.14s)]
*  That is a prerequisite for staying sane and healthy and maybe for doing better eternally. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3715.58s)]
*  So if you're busy on the road, headed to kids sports, there was always time to pray and reflect [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3721.74s)]
*  alone or as a family, but it's hard to be organized about it. Building a foundation of prayer is going [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3726.22s)]
*  to be absolutely critical as we head into November, praying that God's will is done in this country and [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3731.82s)]
*  that peace and healing come to us here in the United States and around the world. Christianity, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3737.1s)]
*  obviously, is under attack everywhere. That's not an accident. Why is Christianity, the most [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3742.2999999999997s)]
*  peaceful of all religions, under attack globally? Did you see the opening of the Paris Olympics? [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3748.7799999999997s)]
*  There's a reason because the battle is not temporal. It's taking place in the unseen world. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3753.5s)]
*  It's a spiritual battle, obviously. So try Hallow. Get three months completely free at Hallow. That's [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3759.18s)]
*  Hallow.com slash Tucker. If there's ever a time to get spiritually in tune and ground yourself [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3765.82s)]
*  in prayer, it's now. Hallow will help personally and strongly and totally sincerely recommended. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3771.9s)]
*  Hallow.com slash Tucker. What happened to all the Bush people? You were here for that. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3778.78s)]
*  Not just President Bush and his family, pretty clear for Kamala Harris, but all the people who [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3787.1000000000004s)]
*  staffed that administration. Do all of them still buy those ideas, those 20-year-old ideas, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3792.14s)]
*  or have any come around to your position? It's a great question because I know a lot of them. It's [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3799.58s)]
*  like you. I like a lot of them. Some of them know. I admire some. I don't admire others. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3804.3799999999997s)]
*  A lot of them put flags in the ground with the foolish and inappropriate never Trump letters [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3810.8599999999997s)]
*  in 2016. So their hands are a bit tied. So I don't know how they would behave in a vacuum. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3815.66s)]
*  I think you see various stages of grief, various people adapting in different ways or not adapting. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3821.34s)]
*  Some people are unreconstructed. Some are resigned to where things are going. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3828.06s)]
*  You know what's funny about the Bush? I mean, you remember this better than I do, but I remember [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3835.1000000000004s)]
*  Bush ran on a more humble foreign policy. I know. I mean, actually what Trump's saying is not that [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3839.6600000000003s)]
*  radically different from the Bush vibe, which was against the crusading progressivism of Bill [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3844.46s)]
*  Clinton. Now he ended up totally abandoning that, unfortunately, to his eternal discredit. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3849.42s)]
*  And in a sense, he was a progressive. He was armed progressivism. Bill Kristol is, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3855.5s)]
*  let's fight the end of history, basically, which is like, that's not in any way. And I mean, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3860.14s)]
*  conservative, I'm not like Angela dancing on the head of a pin. It's not common sense. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3865.98s)]
*  But I think a lot of those people, it's probably going to be hard to incorporate them. There's [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3871.66s)]
*  sort of two and sociologically, again, it's they're invested in the old model. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3878.22s)]
*  And so I think we're going to need the trouble is that all the credentialing has been on that side. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3885.5s)]
*  And so all of it, almost all of it. I mean, I'm not to make it anything myself, but like I'm a [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3891.74s)]
*  rare and I was, I was teetering on the maybe passing over to the edge of respectability or [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3896.2999999999997s)]
*  whatever the mainstream is, you know, for years. And, you know, I think what I find, though, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3901.98s)]
*  encouraging Tucker is I, and this is where I mean, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3908.94s)]
*  Can I say that you went to Groton and Harvard, right? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3911.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3914.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3914.46s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3914.86s)]
*  So are you the only person in the world who went to Groton and Harvard who voted for Donald Trump? [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3916.86s)]
*  You know, I don't think so. Actually, my Groton and Harvard roommate was indicating. I think there [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3921.9s)]
*  are a few others. I mean, I, you know, but I mean, okay, so you got me. I, you know, people say this [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3925.02s)]
*  sometimes, and I think they say it about you too. It's like, oh, you're from an elite background. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3929.58s)]
*  How can you not support the elite? And I'm always like, the elite is supposed to work for the public [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3932.14s)]
*  interest. And by the way, that was the model. Teddy Roosevelt was behind the founding of Groton [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3936.2999999999997s)]
*  school, which I went there. I have very fond memories. A lot of people who are associated [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3939.98s)]
*  with that hate Donald Trump and everything. I proudly support him. But I think the whole point [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3943.34s)]
*  is to serve, you know, service is perfect freedom. The idea is public service is putting the interests [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3948.86s)]
*  of the public ahead. And so I, to be honest, I find the current establishment, I look at Morning [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3954.14s)]
*  Joe or something and I'm like, this is not what America deserves. Okay. So I have the same [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3958.86s)]
*  perspective and I would say more broad, the identical perspective. And I would say that nobody [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3963.1s)]
*  reforms the system who doesn't understand the system. Yeah. And you're always going to have [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3967.7400000000002s)]
*  it. Teddy Roosevelt saved capitalism in the United States by restraining. And he was hated by his [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3973.34s)]
*  peers. By restraining the monopolies. Exactly. And the only reason he was able to do that was [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3977.98s)]
*  because he was pushing back against his own class. He understood them. Right. Right. So no, I'm not [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3981.98s)]
*  attacking you for going to Harvard. I'm rather saying, I think it's essential that you understand [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3987.9s)]
*  JD Vance hated Trump, went to Yale Law School, started going up to the Aspen Institute to speak [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=3994.3s)]
*  in the summer, found the people there so repulsive. He's like, oh, he was totally right. That he has [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4000.7000000000003s)]
*  become their nightmare. Exactly. Because he knows who they are. He had dinner with David Brooks [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4004.3s)]
*  many times. Exactly. So anyway. Totally. Totally. And I think like, and I think like that's, you know, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4008.54s)]
*  I love this clip of Maggie Goodlander getting called out by this. I know. You know, it should [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4014.22s)]
*  be challenged if you're, like anybody should be subject to challenge. And that's what's so great [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4018.8599999999997s)]
*  about like X and podcasts. Did Maggie Goodlander win? I'm embarrassed. I think so. I'm not sure. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4023.18s)]
*  And I'm like not picking on her particularly, but like, you know, there's a fair point. But I mean, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4028.54s)]
*  my view is, and it's Apropos, because the other woman I think was in, I think she's, her family's [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4032.3799999999997s)]
*  from China. But you know, even under Mao, I mean, the ultimate egalitarian system, there is an [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4036.3799999999997s)]
*  establishment. There is an elite. And of course Xi Jinping is a product of that elite. Dogs create [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4041.82s)]
*  hierarchies. You're always going to have a hierarchy. So the question is not, do you have [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4046.54s)]
*  a ruling class? You're getting a ruling class. Is it good? Do you have a good ruling class? Exactly. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4049.82s)]
*  Or do you have Jake Sullivan and Tony Blinken? That's the best we got. And here's the other thing, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4053.98s)]
*  you know, and I don't want to cry too much over River here, but like they are the establishment [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4059.34s)]
*  and they act in like a sociologically conservative way. They're all going to leave office and they're [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4064.1400000000003s)]
*  all going to get great jobs on Wall Street and they're all going to go to law firms and whatever. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4069.1s)]
*  And it's the people who are taking on the establishment and are taking the slings and [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4073.02s)]
*  arrows and hopefully metaphorically alone. But to me, that's the point. That's what you're [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4077.1s)]
*  supposed to do. If you, if you know, as the Bible says to whom much is given of much is expected. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4082.22s)]
*  I strongly agree with that. And I think you're a model of that, honestly. And I'm not just saying [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4086.7799999999997s)]
*  that apart. Well, no, but I really believe in that. And I'm just, I'm just so offended by, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4090.7s)]
*  I'm so offended by the mediocrity and selfishness and stupidity of our ruling class that I just can't. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4095.98s)]
*  And I don't care if they kill me. I will never stop feeling that way. I know you don't. And [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4101.26s)]
*  that's your incredibly courageous. So, um, Brits Colby, I am rooting for you fervently. I just [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4103.9s)]
*  wanted to make sure everyone knows who you are and what you think this process is taking place [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4109.5s)]
*  privately as it has to. But I also think that people who voted for Trump because they want [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4114.22s)]
*  a calmer world, they don't want the United States or him to be destroyed in wars. I think they should [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4120.3s)]
*  know what's going on. So I hope this provides a little sunlight. Thank you very much, my friend. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4125.66s)]
*  Bless you. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtsGqGc-Iuw&t=4129.66s)]
