# Dave Smith: Debating Douglas Murray, the “Woke Right” Narrative, and the Moment He Found God
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM)
*  Dave, I'm really glad to see you. I know you've been here before. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=0.0s)]
*  But it's nice to have you back. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4.0s)]
*  I am an expert in all things Tucker Carlson. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7.16s)]
*  So I know you've been asked this a million times, but I'm coming to this late. How do [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=10.76s)]
*  you assess the debate that you had with Douglas Murray? Now, it's been a month. How long has [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=17.7s)]
*  it been? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=23.76s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=24.76s)]
*  Something like a month, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=25.76s)]
*  Yep. A few weeks. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=26.76s)]
*  Getting back, what was that? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=27.76s)]
*  It's an interesting question. I mean, I think, I think essentially it was what everyone saw. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=50.84s)]
*  It's like my first impression of it, my impression during it, during the first half hour of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=57.0s)]
*  debate, I was like, well, Douglas just embarrassed himself in front of the world. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=62.04s)]
*  You felt that in real time. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=69.2s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, it was, you know, look, it was, he was ridiculous. And it was, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=70.56s)]
*  it was kind of strange to witness as it was happening. I go, so you decided to open the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=77.4s)]
*  debate by just chastising everyone as not being as good as you, that the expert class [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=82.98s)]
*  ought to be the ones consulted, that you, I mean, you know, you could argue what he [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=90.9s)]
*  exactly he was saying, but he was clearly saying that you, you guys on podcasts are [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=95.42s)]
*  simply not qualified to talk about these subjects. Now you're saying this on the Joe Rogan experience. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=103.0s)]
*  Of all places to go and deliver this message, this is the place guaranteed to turn the entire [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=111.3s)]
*  audience against you. And of course, I just think that, I think it's a ridiculous non-argument [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=116.96s)]
*  that never would have made sense. But coming off of the COVID years, the idea that you're [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=123.58s)]
*  going to convince people that you ought to kind of, they ought to trust your opinions, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=129.5s)]
*  that your class ought to be trusted was a ridiculous, you know, attack. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=138.22s)]
*  But he's not even in that class. I mean, he's not, I know Douglas and I think that I'm always [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=142.34s)]
*  gotten along with him and I think that he's clever, but he's clever in a boarding school [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=146.94s)]
*  way. He went to boarding school as I did and you instantly recognise it in the way that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=150.74s)]
*  he debates, which is by dropping references that suggest deep air edition that doesn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=155.46s)]
*  actually exist. I think he's clever. He's got a kind of bullshitty boarding school vibe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=160.5s)]
*  to him again that I recognise that I have sometimes. So I'm not, you know, not trying [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=165.18s)]
*  to be holier than now, but like the idea that he's an expert is absurd. He's a journalist [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=169.18s)]
*  like the rest of us who's been taken on PR tours in various countries by their governments [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=173.3s)]
*  trying to win his support. Got it? I've done that too. But he's hardly an expert on anything. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=177.18s)]
*  Well, also it doesn't look all of this. So the analogy that I've used about it is that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  two UFC fighters that are going to fight, so they've signed the contract, they've done [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=192.58s)]
*  their training camps, they show up to Madison Square Garden, they both get in the octagon [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=196.5s)]
*  and like one of them puts up his hands and then the other one puts his hands down and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=200.86s)]
*  goes, you know, I'm such a better fighter than you. And this is ridiculous that me and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  you are even fighting. It's like, oh, okay, but we are, but we are, we're here. We both [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  accepted, we're both here. So if you are such a better fighter, if you have trained so much [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  more, if you have all these advantages against me, well, then you can't just tell, you have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=221.44s)]
*  to demonstrate that. Take on the argument. You should be able to then destroy me. And [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=226.32s)]
*  so he weirdly opened with this thing where he was going to turn everybody off, turn everyone [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=232.32s)]
*  against it because the style is bullshit. Even if you're, and I've had lots of people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=237.56s)]
*  who are pro-Israel reach out to me since then and be like, listen, I disagree with you on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=241.22s)]
*  the issue, but that was ridiculous the way he attempted to argue. Because weirdly, number [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=245.8s)]
*  one, you're turning everyone against you. And number two, you're just setting the bar so [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  much higher for yourself. Because now once we start actually getting into the debate, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=255.76000000000002s)]
*  you've already explained that you should be dominating me on every facet of this. And yet [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=260.08000000000004s)]
*  you're not. And yet actually, when it comes down to it, you have no answer for the points [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=266.12s)]
*  that I'm making. And that was the theme of the entire knowledge. Yes, that's right. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=271.68s)]
*  But no, but there was, there were two points in the debate that actually stuck out to me [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  the most. And it wasn't the have you been, which is, you know, was the funniest thing [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  that everyone's making that, you know, Douglas will be mocked for eternity for, but you know, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=287.32s)]
*  he made his own bed. But the two points to me that really stuck out in the debate, because [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  this is the way my mind works is that I'm like, oh, if you like, give me something, give me [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=296.88s)]
*  something to challenge me on. That will actually keep me up at night, by the way, if you were [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  to be like, no, Dave, you got this completely wrong. And you need to read these three books [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=306.35999999999996s)]
*  to understand why you're missing all this information. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=309.67999999999995s)]
*  Can I interrupt and say, knowing you pretty well, I think, I mean this, I believe I would [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=312.0s)]
*  take a lot of tests or tests and pass. I believe that if you read those books and found that [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=317.64s)]
*  you were wrong, that you would admit it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=322.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah. I've done this lots of times before. I have, I have views from a decade ago that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=323.56s)]
*  are quite embarrassing in hindsight. I was at one, I was an atheist at one point. I was [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=328.32s)]
*  pro life, excuse me, I was pro choice at one point. I've got this, I was up for open borders. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I've been, I've had all of those. I've had some really bad views over the years and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=338.96s)]
*  I've changed my mind all because. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  Do you think Douglas would admit if he was wrong? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=344.35999999999996s)]
*  Well, of course not. I mean, that's, that's obvious, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=346.44s)]
*  No, but that's kind of the asset test. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=349.11999999999995s)]
*  Well, look, if you can get Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Ukraine and COVID wrong, and [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=350.11999999999995s)]
*  then with certainty say you're right about the next one and then also tell also arguing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=356.4s)]
*  that the other person should have some humility. I mean, come on. Like what is this? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=362.91999999999996s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=367.76s)]
*  It's just too, you couldn't write. If I just scripted this for you and wrote it on a script, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=368.76s)]
*  you'd be like, take it down. This is too ridiculous. No one would believe this, but regardless [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=372.08s)]
*  of that. So there were two moments that actually really stood out to me in the debate were, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=378.46s)]
*  okay, so number one was in the Ukraine portion. Number two was in the, the Israel portion. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=383.8s)]
*  So in the Ukraine portion, at one point I said to him, we were talking about the, you [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=390.0s)]
*  know, what led up to the war. And so he said something like, he goes, you know, the real [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=395.32000000000005s)]
*  question is why all these countries wanted to join NATO. I mean, we didn't incorporate [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=400.6s)]
*  them in NATO through force. And I was like, well, yes, obviously that's the argument. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=404.76000000000005s)]
*  Isn't that we force the governments willingly wanted to join NATO. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=409.36s)]
*  I was like, that's pretty obvious why you'd want to be, have your defense subsidized [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=412.6s)]
*  and want to have the most powerful government in the history of the world guaranteeing your [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=416.92s)]
*  defense. Sure. And also because they're concerned about the former Soviet Union, which is still [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  Russia and okay. But I was like, but that wasn't the argument. You know, the argument [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=425.64000000000004s)]
*  is why would we do this? And so I was like, let me just give you two bullet points, right? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=429.88s)]
*  Two quick arguments. And the two quick points that I made were number one, the Nyet means [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=435.64000000000004s)]
*  yet memo, which of course, as you know, well, you've talked about this a lot. You talked [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=441.64s)]
*  about this back on your Fox news show was that Bill Burns later director of CIA. Yes. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=445.24s)]
*  The CIA director through Joe Biden's four years, who was the CIA director through this [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=451.64s)]
*  entire war up until Trump took back over. But then the ambassador to Russia in 2008, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=456.2s)]
*  he was the ambassador to Russia. He wrote a private cable to Condoleezza Rice. This [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=460.8s)]
*  was not for the public. This was a private cable that later the heroic Julian Assange [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=465.04s)]
*  released. It's the only reason we know it exists. And he lays out in there that all this talk about [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=469.4s)]
*  Ukrainian entry to NATO is going to lead to a war. And he specifically says that this is the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=475.48s)]
*  brightest of all red lines for the Russians. And if we keep moving forward, they fear this could [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=481.0s)]
*  result in civil war. And then they might have to intervene in his words, quote, a choice the Russians [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=486.28s)]
*  do not want to have to make. So it's like, Hey, there's a pretty compelling piece of evidence. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=493.32s)]
*  And then number two, I said, Stoltenberg, I always say this name wrong, but the head of Stoltenberg, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=498.44s)]
*  the head of NATO, he said that Vladimir Putin in late 2001, put in writing sent a draft treaty to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=505.24s)]
*  NATO and said, if you just put into writing that you will not bring Ukraine into NATO, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=512.92s)]
*  I will not invade the country. This is the head of NATO. So I give him these two points. Okay, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=518.44s)]
*  there's I could talk a lot more about this, but I was like, let's focus on these two. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=523.24s)]
*  Seems to me that all the powerful people involved are admitting that this war was about [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=526.76s)]
*  Ukrainian entry into NATO. And his response was the war was not about Ukrainian entry into NATO. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=530.8399999999999s)]
*  It was about Vladimir Putin's desires to reconstitute the Soviet Union. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=538.4399999999999s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, but what's the response? Like, what's the response to my point? Like, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=543.8s)]
*  I made a point, you made nothing. You just made an assertion. So there was this one where it's like, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=548.8399999999999s)]
*  once you actually get down to it, once you remove all this, like, you're an expert, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=553.72s)]
*  you're not an expert, you've never been, what are you watering? What are the you've got no [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=557.96s)]
*  actual argument here because you're not an expert yourself. Right. But even that it's like that, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=562.36s)]
*  again, just the way I work, that doesn't do anything for me. Then you got to have an actual [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=567.32s)]
*  argument. Otherwise, you're not going to persuade me. And I think for most of the viewers, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=572.76s)]
*  knowledge to write, I just refer back to the boarding school thing. It's like, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=576.52s)]
*  the whole point of that style and debating is to create the illusion of knowledge. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=580.52s)]
*  Well, that's it. You have an Aeschylus quote, sort of, you know what I mean? Or you can cite [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=585.8s)]
*  the titles of three D.H. Lawrence novels, but you haven't read the novels. You haven't read [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=590.68s)]
*  Aeschylus. You don't actually have it. You don't have an original thought that's actually yours. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=593.96s)]
*  You don't even have the material. You haven't even read the books. It's a sleight of hand. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=598.36s)]
*  That's what they teach you in boarding school. Well, okay. So then the other one, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  which some people did pick up on this, but this to me was like actually the biggest [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=611.96s)]
*  moment of the debate, I thought. And it was sad in a way because Douglas Murray is someone who [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=615.8800000000001s)]
*  I have some degree of respect for as a smart person. It was kind of sad that he was reduced [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=622.36s)]
*  to this. But so he made the argument. He said, first off, he was dishonest. And I didn't call [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=626.7600000000001s)]
*  him. I knew this, but I let it slide. But he goes, you know, I was very iffy about the war [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=634.04s)]
*  in Libya. And it's like, I've read your columns at the time. No, you fucking Warrens. Okay. Anyway, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=638.1999999999999s)]
*  but he goes, I was very iffy about the war in Libya, but the war in Libya was fought because [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=643.8s)]
*  there was this tremendous fear that Gaddafi was about to go genocidal and it was a humanitarian [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=649.0s)]
*  intervention. And so then I said, okay. Now they have slave markets in Tripoli. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=653.8s)]
*  Right. It's humanitarian. But forget even the point that, okay, maybe their argument is they [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  thought he was going to go genocidal and they didn't realize it would be so much worse without [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=662.84s)]
*  him. Like what, but I said, okay, Douglas, so riddle me this then if it was a humanitarian [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=666.44s)]
*  intervention, how come I have four star general Wesley Clark telling me 10 years prior that we [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=671.0s)]
*  had already made the plans to go over throw Gaddafi because he said this very clearly to Amy Goodman [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=677.96s)]
*  on democracy now. And then I mentioned that he later, actually very recently on on Pierce Morgan, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=683.0s)]
*  he clarified this is really interesting for people to go watch Scott Horton, who is amazing, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=689.96s)]
*  by the way, his book provoked is the best book on Russia, the US post collapse of the Soviet [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  union relations. His book enough already is the best book that's been written on the terror wars. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=702.0400000000001s)]
*  So Scott Horton is debating Wesley Clark on Pierce Morgan. And this gets brought up, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=707.08s)]
*  you know, the fact that you said in 2001, you had already seen in the Pentagon that we were going [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=711.32s)]
*  to overthrow seven countries in five years. And, okay, so he says, he goes, well, actually, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=716.84s)]
*  the plans go back to 1991. And I saw them first from Paul Wolfowitz's office. And then basically, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=723.64s)]
*  the plans got killed. And then they were revived by Richard Pearl and a study paid for by the [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=731.1600000000001s)]
*  Israelis. This was four star general Wesley Clark's comments on it. So I brought that up. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=736.84s)]
*  And I go, well, look, you're going to say that this is a, you know, a humanitarian intervention, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=742.44s)]
*  but that seems strange, because the plans to overthrow Gaddafi were already written [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=747.4000000000001s)]
*  many years earlier. And then they had their opportunity. And they did it, I think it was [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=752.2800000000001s)]
*  more than just a humanitarian intervention. And then his response is this thing about how Paul [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=755.6400000000001s)]
*  Wolfowitz, his name starts with an animal and ends Jewish. And it was kind of funny the way he said [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=762.7600000000001s)]
*  it. But then he just, he went, be careful what you're watering there. Because you can't, you know, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=769.4s)]
*  a lot of people are going to hate Jews if you just start bringing up Paul Wolfowitz's name. And I [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=775.0799999999999s)]
*  just could not believe, by the way, the end result of that is he had no response to what I was saying. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=780.92s)]
*  He didn't have a response to why this wasn't- But because Paul Wolfowitz has an identifiably [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=786.28s)]
*  Jewish name, you're abetting anti-Semitism by bringing it up, even though he's a government [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=790.36s)]
*  official who helped get us into this war that killed a million people? Yeah, he's also in [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=795.4s)]
*  other places talked about how Paul Wolfowitz is like a hero in the Kurds in Iraq, consider him [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=799.32s)]
*  a hero because he was the architect of the war that overthrew Saddam Hussein. But like, I'm not [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=806.44s)]
*  allowed to mention him because that, which is, first of all, it's just beside the point. Like, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=811.24s)]
*  forget what this will lead to. What's the truth? That's what matters. So he's, of course, a very [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=816.6s)]
*  pro-Kurdish, I would imagine. Right. Yes, yes, I'm sure. Well, I actually have been there. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=822.7600000000001s)]
*  Have you? Yes, I have been there. And I can say firsthand, the most brutal people I've ever [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=827.8000000000001s)]
*  met in my life were Kurds. Like, actually, I saw it firsthand. So I'm not against the Kurds or [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=832.6s)]
*  whatever, but it's just interesting, everyone in Washington, no one's ever met a Kurd, can't define [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=838.5200000000001s)]
*  what a Kurd is, but everyone reflexively loves the Kurds. And I've never had strong views about the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=844.2800000000001s)]
*  Kurds. But again, I just want to say I've seen it in action in Iraq, and I was shocked by the Kurdish [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=850.2s)]
*  behavior personally. Yeah. Well, also, it's all the people who were knocking Donald Trump in his [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=855.24s)]
*  first term when he wanted to pull out of Syria. And they were like, what about the Kurds? We can't [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=862.92s)]
*  betray the Kurds. And then those same people will tell you what a great president George H.W. Bush [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  was. But we can't betray the Kurds, right? The guy who really betrayed the Kurds, I mean, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=870.52s)]
*  told them to rise up against Saddam Hussein and overthrow him and then decided, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=876.04s)]
*  ah, we're going to back off of that and just allowed them to get slaughtered. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  You know, but, and look, I mean, it was just kind of blatant. It's like, I'm presenting an argument [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=885.0s)]
*  and you're responding with a pure woke tactic, a pure woke tactic to say, which I, as I mentioned [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=891.72s)]
*  to him, I go, but wouldn't this apply to everything you stand for? I mean, everything you stand for [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=898.44s)]
*  about how we shouldn't have so much Muslim immigration into the UK. Okay, well, someone [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=903.96s)]
*  could take that and that might lead to a rise in hatred of Muslim people, but that's not a [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=907.96s)]
*  counter argument. That's not an argument. That's like, well, okay, well then maybe you could say, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=914.0400000000001s)]
*  you should also add in there. I don't mean all Jewish people are guilty of some conspiracy, but [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=918.84s)]
*  first of all, I'm Jewish and he's not. So like, what the hell are you talking about? [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=925.08s)]
*  Well, I wouldn't say you're Jewish. And that gets me to, I mean, I don't think you'd convince [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=927.64s)]
*  Douglas that you're Jewish. So I saw that and read the commentary after and as someone who's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=931.96s)]
*  always liked Douglas and known him for a while, my first instinct was why he just destroyed his [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=937.64s)]
*  career. Like he's done. No smart person will ever take Douglas seriously again. And I don't, I don't [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=942.6s)]
*  know if he felt that way, but it was clear by a day or two after he realized he destroyed his career. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=949.3199999999999s)]
*  And in response, rather than admitting that and admitting what he'd done wrong, he attacked you [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=954.04s)]
*  really kind of doubled down in the New York Post. I want to read this because I was offended by this. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=959.08s)]
*  He goes, the whole column's an attack on you. And I'm quoting, claiming some Jewish ancestry. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=964.12s)]
*  Smith has spent the last 18 months since October 7th being very unfunny. Indeed. Claiming some [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=973.1600000000001s)]
*  Jewish ancestry. Now I'm not really sure. Well, I'm just going to, I don't know why that just, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=981.1600000000001s)]
*  Oh, wow. So what do you claim some Jewish ancestry? I, my mom and dad are probably the big ones. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=987.0s)]
*  I do, I do claim some Jewish ancestry. But yeah, it's, I mean, it was so, well, first of all, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=995.48s)]
*  I don't, which I'm not even the first, cause everyone made this joke already about the art, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1001.72s)]
*  but he says, I haven't been funny. And I just, Douglas has never been to one of my comedy shows. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1005.0s)]
*  So he should come and check it out. And then he could tell me what he thinks. I think I'm pretty [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1010.2800000000001s)]
*  damn funny in my shows. And the audience seems to think so. But what is your Jewish ancestor? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1015.0s)]
*  You claim, I mean, first of all, he suggests that you're like a fake Jew. Yeah. Yeah. Claiming some [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1020.84s)]
*  Jewish ancestry. It's like you're hiding behind a cloak of ersatz Judaism, which is in a way, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1025.72s)]
*  you know, one of the things I thought was so interesting about the piece was that, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1033.32s)]
*  and I couldn't imagine, man, I hope I'm never this person. Because even now, right, like there's so, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1037.88s)]
*  there's so many shots I could take at Douglas. But even when you ask me about the debate, like [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1043.8s)]
*  my first instinct is to go like, well, look, here are the points I made that he didn't have counters [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1047.8799999999999s)]
*  to, cause I'm about the argument, you know, like that's what actually matters. And it's, it's tough [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1052.44s)]
*  for all of us because there is, as you know, well, you've talked a lot about this, right? But it's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1056.84s)]
*  like in this kind of show business news world where we're talking about events and things that matter, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1061.48s)]
*  but also there's a camera on us and we're talking on a microphone and we're, we're public people. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1068.36s)]
*  And so it's kind of impossible to completely remove your ego and your own narcissistic [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1074.52s)]
*  tendencies from that. Yes. But like, you gotta keep reminding yourself like, yeah, but there's a [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1078.6799999999998s)]
*  fucking war going on. Like that's what actually matters. All of this is much less important than [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1082.76s)]
*  like the actual policy. So you try to focus on that, but I could not imagine writing an article [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1087.8799999999999s)]
*  about a debate that I had just been in where the reaction was so unfavorable toward me. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1094.12s)]
*  And in the piece, what you might notice is he does not take on a single one of my arguments. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1100.12s)]
*  He does not point out something that I got wrong. He does not say Dave argued this, but this is so [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1105.1599999999999s)]
*  clearly a reflection of his lack of knowledge on this subject because he didn't account for X, [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1109.8799999999999s)]
*  Y, and Z. It's just once it just like the actual debate, he would only debate me. He wouldn't debate [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1114.68s)]
*  the topic. We're always looking for cool companies that make products that make you feel better. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1122.68s)]
*  And that's how we ran into Bond Charge. Bond Charge offers a wide range of products that improve [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1126.92s)]

*  basically, it felt to me like he was sent on a kamikaze mission. That's the way it looked. Here, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1198.9199999999998s)]

*  think he destroyed his reputation. And so his reputation amongst the people, but his career is [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1217.32s)]
*  actually going to be fine. Much like Kamala Harris's career is actually going to be fine. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1223.08s)]
*  And I don't know. I'm speculating a little bit with this because there was not almost any [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1227.32s)]
*  interaction off the podcast. Douglas Murray showed up five minutes later, we were recording. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1234.44s)]
*  He left immediately afterward and me and Rogan hung out. So there's nothing more that the viewer [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1239.72s)]
*  didn't see that I saw really. Hellos and goodbyes. But I think number one, one of my guesses, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1245.0800000000002s)]
*  I'm speculating here, is that he just wasn't really prepared for me. And it was like, oh, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1253.72s)]
*  a comedian will be on there. And maybe he came in kind of confident that he'll be able to handle [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1261.32s)]
*  me. I've had that happen a few times in my career. I think it's happening less. I can't imagine he [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1266.52s)]
*  didn't look into me before the debate, but maybe that's possible. But the feeling that I got as it [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1271.72s)]
*  was going on was kind of, okay, I'm sure you do. You remember very well when Kamala Harris was [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1278.84s)]
*  running for president. I know that seems like a long time ago, but that actually happened, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1285.6399999999999s)]
*  which is really crazy. It's like a dream sequence. Now it's not just that Dick Cheney and Liz Cheney [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1289.24s)]
*  endorsed her, but she started bringing Liz Cheney out to campaign events and campaigning with Liz [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1295.0s)]
*  Cheney. Now, if you were just looking at this on paper, you'd go, okay, what demographic of voters [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1302.28s)]
*  is this for? And you'd very quickly realize that that demographic doesn't exist. No. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1310.84s)]
*  Are the leftists, they still remember her last name as Cheney. And especially with the year that [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1316.6s)]
*  had proceeded, they're kind of anti-war again. And they're not really into the idea of we've [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1322.28s)]
*  got a Cheney on our side. It's not going to win you. It's not going to get out your base. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1328.68s)]
*  And then on the other side, she lost by like 50 points in her congressional run. It's not like [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1333.16s)]
*  you're bringing Republicans in. And so I think the only thing you could conclude is that, oh, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1339.72s)]
*  this isn't actually for the voters. There's somebody else who Kamala Harris is talking to [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1344.44s)]
*  here. There's a power source that may be a little concerned about her and she's trying to let them [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1349.0s)]
*  know, don't worry, I'm good for business. I've got Liz Cheney right here. That's kind of my [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1355.4s)]
*  assumption. It seemed to me with the Douglas Murray thing, he wasn't playing in the audience. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1362.2s)]
*  He certainly wasn't trying to persuade Joe. No. He perhaps was talking to a different audience, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1367.64s)]
*  which will make sure that his career is just fine going forward. That's the sense I got. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1373.96s)]
*  If you want to make people paranoid and hateful, act like that. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1377.88s)]
*  Well, again, look, there's two things that I really want to make sure I express. Number one, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1380.92s)]
*  with the thing where he's this claim some Jewish ancestry thing, which by the way would be, I think [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1387.56s)]
*  if you were to ever do this to say like a Jewish person who was on your side, you would be like, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1393.96s)]
*  that's a pretty anti-Semitic thing to do, right? To challenge their Jewishness because they [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1399.56s)]
*  disagree with a policy. What does your Jewishness have to do with it anyway? [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1404.76s)]
*  Right. That's the whole fucking point. I think it's basically like this. I think that [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1408.6s)]
*  particularly when it comes to the Israel stuff, a lot of these guys don't know what to do with me [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1415.6399999999999s)]
*  because typically, as every American who's ever criticized Israel knows, you get labeled as being [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1420.12s)]
*  a Jew hater. Oh, you must be anti-Semitic. That's why you would say something like that. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1427.0s)]
*  Remember that horrible anti-Semite Pat Buchanan who said that the Israel lobby wanted a war in Iraq? [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1432.04s)]
*  She just hates Jewish people. Even though we all know that's true, when you say it, they go, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1439.08s)]
*  you're an anti-Semite. That's like the game that they play. That's much tougher to do [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1444.52s)]
*  when you're talking to someone who's Jewish. And so in a sense, that ends up being kind of a shield [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1449.0s)]
*  against the accusation. And so they want to remove that shield so that you don't have... [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1456.04s)]
*  But the bottom line is that no one should have that shield. And I am Jewish. My mother and father [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1460.68s)]
*  are both Jewish. I think I was 86% Ashkenazi Jew on my DNA test. I think that's enough. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1465.24s)]
*  But the point is, it shouldn't matter. It shouldn't matter at all. You should anybody... [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1471.72s)]
*  We're talking about the behavior of nations, by the way. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1477.1599999999999s)]
*  Nations with militaries and parliaments, congresses, like these are countries. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1479.8s)]
*  What does this have to do? I mean... Well, first of all, and this isn't even the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1487.3999999999999s)]
*  most important point, but the American taxpayer is forced to pay for this stuff. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1490.44s)]
*  But even if he wasn't, even if you didn't have to pay for it, if you're a human being, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1494.52s)]
*  forget even an American, if you're a human being, you have a right to have an opinion on any issue [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1499.24s)]
*  you want to have an opinion on. This is what the left did during COVID. It was like, wait a second, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1503.8799999999999s)]
*  it seems like this came from... You're telling me it came from a pangolin in a wet market, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1508.52s)]
*  a fish market, a mammal sold in a fish market, somehow was the genesis of this virus. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1512.6s)]
*  But there was this level three bio lab like a mile away. Maybe that was the source. They're like, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1518.6s)]
*  ah, you hate Asians. And they claimed racism. So you couldn't pursue that line of inquiry. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1523.24s)]
*  I see people like Douglas Murray supposedly on the right. And there are a lot of others [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1529.72s)]
*  like Douglas Murray saying the same thing. You can't express an opinion about where your tax [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1533.56s)]
*  dollars go, about people dying or else you're a bigot. How is that different? [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1539.72s)]
*  Right. No, it's not. It's the same thing. It's the same kind of pathetic tactic where if you can't [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1544.44s)]
*  argue against someone's ideas, you just say, oh, you're a bad person. And that's why you have [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1552.76s)]
*  these ideas to begin with. It's a very low grade social psychology attempt to shame someone out of [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1557.8s)]
*  having the views that they have. And yeah, it's exactly... It's what the woke did on everything. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1566.28s)]
*  No matter what it was. I can't remember who coined the term, but a racist is anybody winning an [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1571.8799999999999s)]
*  argument against a progressive. Exactly. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1579.96s)]
*  That's it. And so he's doing the same thing. But then the other thing, which is really [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1582.28s)]
*  separate and secondary from that, but the argument that Douglas Murray is making is that if I call [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1587.64s)]
*  out Paul Wolfowitz, or even more broadly speaking, if I call out the neoconservatives and how they [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1594.2800000000002s)]
*  hijacked American foreign policy and how they very much had Israel's interest in mind, which I get [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1600.76s)]
*  from reading the neoconservatives. I don't get this from reading critics of them. It's from in [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1606.2800000000002s)]
*  their own words. He's saying me calling that out is fertile ground for Jew hatred to rise. And it's [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1611.32s)]
*  like, no, what you're doing is fertile ground. I agree with that. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1619.48s)]
*  What you telling me I'm not allowed to call out the deputy defense secretary because his last [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1623.24s)]
*  name is Jewish? That's actually what leads to a rise in people not liking Jews. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1629.56s)]
*  I couldn't agree more. And I do think Douglas, though he's not an expert or a genius, is smart [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1634.36s)]
*  enough to understand that, but he did it anyway. And I don't know his motive, but in the moment [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1640.68s)]
*  that I think made me actually turn it off, I had to stop watching, but it was most revealing of all, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1647.0800000000002s)]
*  is when he was after Daryl Cooper, the historian, really one of the great historians in the United [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1652.44s)]
*  States, Daryl Cooper, and doesn't know his name. But it goes after him personally as like a Nazi or [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1657.0800000000002s)]
*  something. And then we just parenthetically, and I'll shut up after this, but Daryl Cooper is one [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1663.48s)]
*  of the kindest, most reasonable, most fundamentally liberal people I know, anti-Nazi people. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1667.08s)]
*  I know a guy who you could give your routing number to, would never steal money. A guy who, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1673.48s)]
*  if he had absolute power, would kill nobody. Like a truly decent Christian man, basically called him [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1677.8799999999999s)]
*  a monster and didn't even know his name. And so that suggested to me that he was like briefed by [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1685.08s)]
*  somebody before. So make sure you get in this Holocaust, which he's not. Daryl Cooper, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1691.32s)]
*  like what is that? Well, it's also, if you're smearing people who, and Daryl wasn't the only [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1696.9199999999998s)]
*  one, but if you're smearing people whose names you don't know and who you admit you've never [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1704.6s)]
*  listened to any of their work, maybe don't put that right in the middle of an appeal to expertise. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1710.36s)]
*  Maybe have that in a different section than in the section where you're going, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1719.2399999999998s)]
*  you really have to know what you're talking about in order to have an opinion on these things. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1722.44s)]
*  And so that didn't work out very well. Daryl is an amazing guy. He is brilliant. His work is [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1727.24s)]
*  phenomenal. I know him personally and he's like genuinely a great person. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1735.24s)]
*  He's a humane man. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1739.88s)]
*  Yes. And it's something, it's a comment on our time and on our society that the guy who, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1741.16s)]
*  essentially, if you actually consume any of Daryl's work, as I have consumed a lot of it, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1750.2s)]
*  basically Daryl's whole kind of, his template, the way he operates is he's, there's basically [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1755.72s)]
*  only like a couple rules. And like number one is he has to read everything that's available [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1763.72s)]
*  on the subject. So he reads everything. The guy's a machine. His depth of knowledge is like second [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1769.16s)]
*  to none. He just knows everything. And then number two is whenever you talk about history, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1775.8s)]
*  basically his rule is that you have to understand that everyone involved is a human being. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1781.3999999999999s)]
*  Every one of them was a three-year-old at one point. So like totally innocent, like good little, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1786.12s)]
*  like my three-year-old that I have at home. And that they grew up in real circumstances and real [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1791.8s)]
*  things happen to them. And if you're going to do history, you have to constantly be doing your [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1797.56s)]
*  absolute best to put yourself in this person's shoes and then put yourself in this person's [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1801.8s)]
*  shoes and then put yourself on this side of the conflict and then put yourself on this side of [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1805.56s)]
*  the conflict. That's basically it. It's pure empathy. And actually, as I've mentioned to you [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1809.0s)]
*  personally, and I've told Daryl this personally, he is probably the best shot people have at [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1815.96s)]
*  de-radicalizing people in the worst form of being radicalized. He's the guy, listen, for me personally, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1822.36s)]
*  and I thought I was pretty well read on the history of Israel-Palestine. And he has this [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1830.44s)]
*  incredibly long series, like a 30-hour series called Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1835.88s)]
*  And the thing is I knew most of what I knew, not all of it, but most of what I had read about with [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1840.92s)]
*  the Israeli-Palestine conflict, like most people, starts in 1947, 1948, and then goes up to today. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1847.0s)]
*  His series is about, it's like from the 1890s until 1947. So he's talking about the creation [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1855.0s)]
*  of the state from Zionism being created to the state being created. And going- [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1861.72s)]
*  From Herzl to Ben-Gurion. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1866.1200000000001s)]
*  Right, right, exactly. That's basically the whole, you know, he has a little bit where he's talking [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1867.24s)]
*  about the pogroms that preceded the Zionists, but that's really the story. And it actually made me [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1872.04s)]
*  much more sympathetic to the Zionists, you know, as somebody who grew up kind of in that propaganda, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1878.8400000000001s)]
*  in the pro-Israel propaganda, then ultimately turned on it and became a critic of Israel. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1883.72s)]
*  Listening to his series, you understand? It just puts you in the position, and you do understand, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1888.44s)]
*  like, oh, okay, these were real men who were reacting to the circumstances of their day. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1892.84s)]
*  You can kind of understand why a lot of them wanted to do this. By the way, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1897.88s)]
*  it's pretty amazing that they pulled it off, however you feel. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1901.08s)]
*  I agree completely. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1903.56s)]
*  However you feel about what the government of Israel is doing, it's amazing that they did this. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1904.68s)]
*  Yeah, look, and of course, for the one- this is why I say it's a comment on our time. So there's [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1909.72s)]
*  one guy here who's going like, listen, you got to like really completely educate yourself on a [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1915.0s)]
*  subject, and then you have to have empathy toward all sides. And then everyone goes, Nazi! That [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1919.0s)]
*  guy's a Nazi! That's what it is to be a Nazi in 2025. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1923.24s)]
*  It's just so funny. I'm too old for a lot of this stuff. And so I thought, you know, among the many [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1927.16s)]
*  lessons, great lessons of the Second World War that I grew up marinating in, dehumanizing people [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1931.8799999999999s)]
*  is bad. Treating human beings like they're not human is bad. And I still believe that. I think [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1938.12s)]
*  it's the core of Christianity, but it's also just the core of any civil society, any decent society. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1944.76s)]
*  And that's what Darrell is trying to do. And I don't know that I've ever heard anybody try [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1951.2399999999998s)]
*  and take apart his factual analysis. It always immediately goes demotive. You're a Nazi. Shut up. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1956.6799999999998s)]
*  You're a Holocaust denier. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1963.56s)]
*  Right. Or claiming he said something that isn't at all what he said. Like he downplayed the [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1965.16s)]
*  atrocities of the Nazis. Why don't you just ask him? No, he didn't. It's also... [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1969.16s)]
*  But why? Why should Darrell Cooper, and by the way, a number of my friends, people I really like, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1974.36s)]
*  have been involved in this. Like their authority has been marshaled to destroy Darrell Cooper. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1980.76s)]
*  And I grieve to see it because they're paid to do it. And it's so degrading to them and dishonest [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1986.36s)]
*  and sad. But why? Darrell Cooper's like this one guy living in the Pacific Northwest. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=1991.8s)]
*  Why spend all this time and energy to destroy him? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2000.2s)]
*  Well, I love... You said this, I forget, a few years ago. I can't remember what it was where [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2003.1599999999999s)]
*  you said this, but it was you. And this really hit home with me. And this isn't like... And you [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2009.24s)]
*  weren't suggesting that this is like a proof. This isn't like an irrefutable logical argument. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2013.8s)]
*  It's kind of like a guide. But you said the thing about you could tell when something's infected [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2019.64s)]
*  because you touch it and you recoil. And you go, oh, something's going on there. Now, what exactly [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2024.44s)]
*  is it? No, that doesn't prove what's going on. But look, you can't... The fact that Darrell's [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2028.92s)]
*  moment on your podcast, sitting right here where I'm sitting, got such a reaction. Really [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2034.6000000000001s)]
*  demonstrates something. And you see that it's like, oh, you touched on like a third rail. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2041.72s)]
*  Or hurt dog barks. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2048.36s)]
*  Yes. Well, and in the same way, when you had first questioned the morality of dropping nuclear [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2049.48s)]
*  weapons on cities, and then there's this big freak out over that. And now nobody here has said, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2054.76s)]
*  hey, the Nazis were the good guys. The Nazis didn't commit any atrocities. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2061.08s)]
*  The Nazis were bad guys. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2064.36s)]
*  No one's even downplaying... No one even made the argument that... [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2065.08s)]
*  I remain anti-Nazi for the work, for the record. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2067.96s)]
*  But I'm saying like, no one even made the argument that like it was 5.9 million, not six. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2070.84s)]
*  This topic hasn't even been broached. But what you are attacking is really the underpinning [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2077.08s)]
*  of the origin story of the American empire. And that's what you're not allowed to question. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2086.12s)]
*  And you see it the way every defender of every war, including the current one, if you can call [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2093.24s)]
*  it a war going on in Gaza, I'm not sure war is exactly the right term to describe it. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2100.3599999999997s)]
*  It's the destruction of a captive people. But every single person who defends it [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2105.64s)]
*  will always invoke World War II at one point. Not even making an argument that this is why [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2113.64s)]
*  it was justified in World War II, just like we did it in World War II. We did it in World War II [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2120.76s)]
*  and we're the good guys. So good guys are allowed to slaughter entire peoples. And look, even if [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2125.88s)]
*  you accept the official World War II story as being completely correct, it's still something [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2135.32s)]
*  that's used to justify all of these other indefensible wars. Every war of my lifetime, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2141.4s)]
*  and I doubt too many people really want to defend the ones in between World War II and when I was [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2147.4s)]
*  born. I don't think anyone's going like, look at Vietnam, it's such a great, such a good thing that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2152.04s)]
*  we did that. And those who are attempting to defend it are pathetic. But Iraq and Libya and Syria [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2156.6s)]
*  and Afghanistan, and even the ones when I was a little kid, Serbia, every one of these guys, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2165.64s)]
*  they always said was Adolf Hitler. Milosevic is Adolf Hitler. Saddam Hussein is Adolf Hitler. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2172.6s)]
*  Gaddafi is Adolf Hitler. Noriega is Adolf Hitler. Every bad guy has always been, it's like they use [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2178.12s)]
*  this model to justify, you're only ever allowed to learn the lesson in history that's like, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2184.12s)]
*  Chamberlain was an appeaser, appeasing bad, confrontation good. As if the lessons of history [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2189.48s)]
*  are that aggression is always correct. Trying to work out a deal is always wrong. And that's why [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2196.68s)]
*  I think it's so important to attack that narrative. Yeah, and from my perspective, it's like not even [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2204.04s)]
*  about principle as much as it is effect. If what we're doing was working, then I guess I wouldn't [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2209.3199999999997s)]
*  be interested in analyzing it so critically, but it's not working. It hasn't worked for the West, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2216.8399999999997s)]
*  which I love. It's where my ancestors are from. It's where my children live. So it's like, [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2223.0s)]
*  I don't know. I think it's fair to ask, how do we get here? It's all falling apart. Why? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2227.3199999999997s)]
*  And maybe the assumptions were bad. And what are those assumptions? Well, they're rooted in that war, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2231.7999999999997s)]
*  as you said. It's just interesting that anyone would want to defend that. I still don't get the [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2235.48s)]
*  motive. Maybe I never will. Why would you want to defend any of that? Why would you want to defend [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2240.68s)]
*  Dresden or Gaza or any things that America did? By the way, it's not attacking Israel. It's attacking [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2244.76s)]
*  the US government, which I pay for, which my ancestors helped build. Why would you ever want [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2253.2400000000002s)]
*  to defend bad things? Well, there is a tendency by people who, if you're pulling away the underpinnings [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2259.48s)]
*  in someone's entire worldview, they usually get very defensive about that. You're right. You're [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2272.2s)]
*  totally right. By the way, I've been there. I have felt defensive. When I first heard Alex Jones [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2276.12s)]
*  question 9-11, I was outraged by it. I was totally outraged by it, in a reflexive, stupid way. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2281.16s)]
*  Well, I remember just because I was very on board with the Ron Paul presidential campaigns. This [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2288.92s)]
*  was my radicalizing moment. Was Ron Paul running for president? And I remember that you were hosting [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2295.8s)]
*  the event that he had. I can't remember what it was called. Very well. It was the Rally for the [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2303.0s)]
*  Republic. The Rally for the Republic. Jesse Ventura in 2008. I should have remembered that. I was the [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2306.92s)]
*  MC of that. So at the time, it was a really big deal for us that we had you MCing it. And because [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2311.32s)]
*  Ron Paul was getting blacked out in all the mainstream media, as we used to call it at the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2318.76s)]
*  time. But we had Tucker Carlson. We had one of the big players in that world hosting the event. And [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2323.88s)]
*  I remember when you- I walked out. I saw an interview with you where someone was like, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2329.48s)]
*  hey, why did you walk out of that event? And you were like, I don't know, man. The saying 9-11 [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2335.48s)]
*  wasn't inside job stuff. It was just a bridge too far for me. And honestly, I totally understood [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2339.6400000000003s)]
*  that at the time. I was just pissed off at Jesse Ventura. Because I was like, come on, dude, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2344.12s)]
*  we actually got a chance here to make a mark. And then you're going to go start spouting out [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2349.16s)]
*  with these conspiracies. But you know, he believed it. I mean, I think Jesse Ventura is a whole rabbit [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2354.3599999999997s)]
*  hole I won't even go down. But I think- I don't know what happened to that guy. Jesse Ventura is [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2358.7599999999998s)]
*  a very flawed guy. For sure. We're all flawed people. I'm a little less judgmental than I used [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2361.48s)]
*  to be. Now that I know the depth of my own shittiness. But which I think is important. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2366.44s)]
*  Meditate every day on your death and your own flaws and you'll be a happy [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2372.28s)]
*  person with better perspective. But I shouldn't have done that. I don't know why. My views are [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2376.36s)]
*  so different. But anyway, the point is, I understand what you're saying. Well, it's also that [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2383.1600000000003s)]
*  it's not even necessarily that you would have to like all these years later be convinced that he [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2390.44s)]
*  was right. It's just I think after so many years of seeing how evil our government actually can be [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2395.72s)]
*  that you go like, okay, I'm listening. All right, fine. I dismissed that out of hand, but now I'm [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2403.3999999999996s)]
*  more open minded to it. Or how about the only question that matters is whether or not something is true. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2408.04s)]
*  And another way to put it, a phrase that I've coined in my copyright is facts don't care about [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2412.6s)]
*  your feelings. That's a good one. You like that? Someone should really run with that. I like that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2417.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a good- You could get a long way. You could get like a special deal with Facebook on that, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2420.9199999999996s)]
*  on the basis of that. But I actually agree with that. Right. And I agree. I don't think you should [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2424.2s)]
*  hurt people's feelings on purpose. But I think the core question, the only one that matters, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2429.72s)]
*  is something true. And I know that you share that. And that's why I hate to beat up on [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2435.48s)]
*  poor Douglas who's like a sad character. But he had this line in here. Oh, this isn't, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2439.48s)]
*  sorry, I never go to my notes, but I'm- No, I- This is from a guy called Sam Harris. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2446.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm loosely familiar. So one of the easiest decisions you're going to make this week is to [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2450.92s)]
*  make your home secure with SimpliSafe. The moment you arm your system, your family, and everything [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2455.4s)]
*  you work for is protected. And you can focus on what matters. You can leave the house without [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2460.6800000000003s)]
*  worrying that someone is going to break in and steal your stuff, violate your sanctuary, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2465.56s)]
*  because the best security system in the country is watching. Millions of Americans use SimpliSafe [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2471.0s)]
*  and enjoy the peace of mind it creates. Now, a traditional burglar alarm only goes off when [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2476.7599999999998s)]

*  So Sam Harris, wow, he doesn't care for you at all, or it looks like me either, but whatever, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2514.52s)]
*  I'll ignore the stuff about me. I'm not even exactly sure who Sam Harris is, but, sad atheist [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2520.2s)]
*  guy, but he describes you as a pure misinformation artist who lies as freely as he breathes. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2525.96s)]
*  And I just thought as I read this, you'd say, Dave Smith, I don't know, whatever, but I feel like [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2534.7599999999998s)]
*  that's the opposite of the truth. I feel like maybe you lie under duress, but in general, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2539.96s)]
*  you are very focused on what you think is true. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2545.56s)]
*  AC Well, I mean, again, I just feel like I benefit in a way from us having this conversation after [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2548.2s)]
*  COVID and after all of these insane things. Okay, so Sam Harris, what did I get wrong? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2557.48s)]
*  AC Like I don't think that if you're going to smear me as being a misinformation artist, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2567.48s)]
*  which I'll take that to, I should make t-shirts about misinformation artists. I'll take that. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2573.24s)]
*  AC Pure misinformation. Everything you say is a lie. It's like breathing to you. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2577.72s)]
*  AC Dude, I got called that throughout all of COVID and I was right about everything I was saying. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2581.7999999999997s)]
*  So keep calling me this. Okay, fine. Make an argument. What have I said that's wrong? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2587.96s)]
*  AC But why is Sam Harris, and why is he so mad at you? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2592.9199999999996s)]
*  AC Well, Sam Harris is- [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2596.2s)]
*  AC But he's a rationalist, right? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2596.9199999999996s)]
*  AC Oh, yeah. He's the guy who defended the war in Iraq and torture and [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2598.12s)]
*  fell for the Russiagate bullshit, thought Trump was a Russian spy, fell for lockdowns and vaccine [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2604.52s)]
*  mandates and all this stuff. So I'll put my misinformation track record up against Sam [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2610.4399999999996s)]
*  Harris's whatever. I mean, I know he's got a meditation app or something like that, but- [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2615.3199999999997s)]
*  AC Did you see the Tim Dillon thing the other day? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2621.24s)]
*  AC Oh, dude, it's so great. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2623.0s)]
*  AC That was like, I texted him. Tim Dillon, the brilliant comedian, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2624.36s)]
*  AC He's the best. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2628.92s)]
*  AC Sam Harris has a meditation app. I didn't even know that. So by day, he's a meditation guru, [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2629.1600000000003s)]
*  and by night, he's encouraging like carpet bombing of children. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2636.6s)]
*  AC I mean, it's just too ridiculous. And you know, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2640.1200000000003s)]
*  AC All of these guys, it's sad in a way because you can't contradict yourself on what your entire [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2644.44s)]
*  purpose was for your entire career without some people noticing. And that's kind of what's going [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2657.48s)]
*  on with all these guys. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2662.84s)]
*  AC But why the emotion? So I notice it even now in our conversation, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2663.56s)]
*  there's a lightness to the way you describe things. You have to say passionate views, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2667.7200000000003s)]
*  but you don't seem emotionally overwrought. Douglas seemed emotionally overwrought. This [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2673.0s)]
*  guy, Harris seems emotionally overwrought. They seem very emotional. What is that? [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2679.48s)]
*  AC Well, I mean, I would say that kind of ironically, although not really actually [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2684.28s)]
*  ironic. And this kind of goes to the conversation that you and Brett Weinstein were having the other [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2691.96s)]
*  day. I really love Brett. I think he's great. I'm on your side of that debate. But I think [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2697.0s)]
*  one of the fundamental flaws in atheism is that it doesn't really exist. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2703.96s)]
*  AC Yes. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2709.48s)]
*  AC They think that's the flaw in believing in God. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2710.36s)]
*  AC No! [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2712.92s)]
*  AC They think the flaw in believing in God is that God really doesn't exist. God does exist. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2713.32s)]
*  What doesn't exist are atheists. There's no such thing. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2718.76s)]
*  AC It is so true! [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2721.8s)]
*  AC And you could even get into an, like maybe if there was such thing as atheists, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2722.44s)]
*  it would be a good thing to be one. But there aren't. They don't exist. They all have their [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2727.48s)]
*  religion. And it's almost by definition that whatever your highest thing is becomes your [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2732.6s)]
*  religion. I don't know if it's quite by definition. And I suppose it is theoretically possible to be [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2740.8399999999997s)]
*  an atheist, but almost no one ever is. And so what you're seeing is just that I'm attacking [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2747.64s)]
*  their religion. And according to them, that makes me guilty of blasphemy. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2753.72s)]
*  AC But it's just so interesting that they're so brittle about it. You'd think if you're an [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2757.56s)]
*  atheist, you'd be like, does it really matter? I mean, there's no right or wrong, obviously, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2761.16s)]
*  because who's the authority on that? Well, there is no authority. So it's all just a matter of [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2764.3599999999997s)]
*  preference. And in the end, you just cease to exist. And so the stakes are zero. So what are [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2768.8399999999997s)]
*  you so mad about? Like, why do you care? You'd think everyone would be like, [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2773.96s)]
*  AC Well, I'll take it a step further. Sam Harris does not believe in free will. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2777.08s)]
*  So what is he upset with me about? I have no choice. I have to be a misinformation artist. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2782.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm wired to be a misinformation artist, right? So what are you upset with? And he's not even [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2788.36s)]
*  making the choice to say that, listen, anytime. And this was one of, again, I really, really like [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2793.24s)]
*  Brett, but I think one of the areas where he failed kind of in that conversation with you in [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2798.04s)]
*  that, you know, very friendly debate is that he had to say several times throughout it, yes, yes, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2804.12s)]
*  I live as if what you're saying is correct. But I view things this way. So yes, I'd much rather live. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2810.84s)]
*  But if your, if your like thesis involves you having to engage in a performative contradiction, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2818.6000000000004s)]
*  then something's not right with your theory. And so Sam Harris will sit here and say, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2826.76s)]
*  none of us have free will, but I'm still going to act as if all of us have free will. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2831.2400000000002s)]
*  You've got a major flaw in your theory that like, this is just too much. This is too far. You can't [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2836.68s)]
*  do that. That's not right. And so, yes, again, with all of them, the bottom line, I think with a lot [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2842.8399999999997s)]
*  of these people, like, and some have adapted better than others. I think Brett's one of the ones who's [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2850.2s)]
*  really adapted well from like the old academia world to this new podcast world that we're in now. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2854.3599999999997s)]
*  But I think the problem with a lot of them, like, like Sam Harris, and I think Douglas Murray too, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2861.56s)]
*  is that what they've worked their entire career on has been completely rejected. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2866.92s)]
*  And that's a tough position to be in. But it's not really, I mean, I spent my whole life in cable [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2872.12s)]
*  news, it, you know, obviously is in terminal decline. I had all kinds of views they argued [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2878.44s)]
*  for passionately. They were totally wrong. I admitted it, I gained perspective and humility, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2884.04s)]
*  in admitting it. You're just a human being. Yeah, but that happened, that, listen, you, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2890.52s)]
*  that may have happened kind of naturally for you. I'm just saying when you run it, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2895.48s)]
*  on scale, very few people are able to do that. It's not hard. It's, it's, it's the only act of [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2899.96s)]
*  liberation that's really possible in this life is freeing yourself from like the lies. And the [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2905.32s)]
*  number one lie is I'm God. Yeah. And like I'm omniscient or, you know, was perfectly wise person, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2911.4s)]
*  whatever. It's like, you know, you make mistakes. You're, you're a ridiculous primate. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2917.64s)]
*  It's a little bit. Covered in fur, like just admit it. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2921.7999999999997s)]
*  Look, you got some things wrong. Yeah. But there's a difference between that and your entire [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2925.56s)]
*  foundation being built on hypocrisy and that hypocrisy being shown. You know, look, I mean, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2932.7599999999998s)]
*  you can't make this stuff up, right? Ben Shapiro built a career opposing identity politics as a [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2939.8s)]
*  proud Zionist. Yeah. Now you listen, feel however you feel about Zionism. It's identity politics. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2949.5600000000004s)]
*  Like, like that is the definition of it. You could not find a better example of a politics [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2959.32s)]
*  built on an identity. And yet you're out here saying facts don't care about your feelings. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2964.92s)]
*  Identity politics is wrong. And then while you're saying that your number one priority is this, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2969.7200000000003s)]
*  this manifestation of identity politics. You can only keep that charade going for so long. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2976.6000000000004s)]
*  No, it's totally true. Before someone sees through it. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2981.88s)]
*  There's something in people that the lowest part of people that instinctively accuses others of [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2984.28s)]
*  doing what they're doing. And I've never really, I mean, I don't, that's the one thing I don't want [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2991.48s)]
*  to be is a guy who does that. But I remember Bill Christo, who I worked for, for years and really [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=2996.76s)]
*  liked him, was grateful to, and he was a great boss in the nineties. And came out against me and [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3000.12s)]
*  called me a Nazi and all this stuff, like without calling me, by the way, I called him and asked [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3006.6s)]
*  him to lunch. He refused. He wouldn't go to lunch with me. End of our relationship. But one of the [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3010.04s)]
*  criticisms against me, I'll never forget it when I realized this phenomenon was real, is when he [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3014.92s)]
*  accused me of advocating, and I'm quoting for an ethnostate. Now I have a lot of flaws. They're all [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3019.56s)]
*  on display. I've never wanted an ethnostate. And it's like, wait, one of us is for an ethnostate. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3027.16s)]
*  And it's not me. But you just said that like of all the possible criticisms. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3033.88s)]
*  It's just too unbelievable. I mean, it's like, you just like, [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3037.88s)]
*  Bill Christo accusing me of wanting an ethnostate. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3041.16s)]
*  You almost like don't even, you can't even respond. You just have to go like, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3045.88s)]
*  it's like I didn't say anything. I was like, okay. Right. Yes. You know, people can't hear [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3049.88s)]
*  themselves. I mean, you know, some people get old, they tell the same stories. And you just, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3055.56s)]
*  you know, when you love them, you're indulgent. But I just hope that doesn't happen. I hope I [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3061.16s)]
*  don't lose all self-awareness to the point where I've got like lunch on my chin and like accuse [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3066.7599999999998s)]
*  other people of doing exactly what I'm doing. Exactly what I'm doing. While you're going, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3072.52s)]
*  you have lunch on your chin. You don't want to be there. I don't want to be that guy. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3076.92s)]
*  And I think that there's like, look, obviously like we're living through something, you know, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3082.6s)]
*  we're probably living through several things that are very profound, but one of the most profound [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3089.48s)]
*  things has been this revolution in information and the technology. And it's led to this like kind of [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3093.2400000000002s)]
*  mass decentralization of media and where there's now like, there's so many things and shows and [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3101.64s)]
*  different voices, you know, I find people all the time who I've never heard of before, you know, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3108.68s)]
*  I'm sure you've had this experience too. You'll find someone you'd be like, Oh, that guy's actually [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3113.24s)]
*  really smart. People should know about this guy. How many followers? 7 million. Oh, he's got 7 [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3116.6s)]
*  million. Oh, he's huge. Like I just found some guy who is bigger than anyone on cable news and I [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3120.76s)]
*  didn't even know he existed, you know? And so now it's just because of this dynamic, there aren't, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3125.72s)]
*  you know, as you know, the corporate media apparatus, like big newspapers and big cable [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3132.68s)]
*  news shows and things was very controlled, very controlled. The range of allowable opinion was [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3138.6s)]
*  very narrow. It's what my good friend and brilliant historian, Tom Woods, always called the, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3145.72s)]
*  was it the three by six card of allowable opinion, you know, you get this little area [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3152.12s)]
*  of allowable opinion and then that's where the conversation takes place. That's been shattered [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3157.3199999999997s)]
*  into a million pieces and now there's voices from all over the place and some good and some great [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3162.7599999999998s)]
*  and some bad and really bad, but it's just much harder for people to, you know, that control [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3167.56s)]
*  existed so that you don't get exposed, so that you don't get exposed, so that you could go like, [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3174.3599999999997s)]
*  look, even the right winger, John McCain, agrees or even the far left activist, Nancy Pelosi. I [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3178.92s)]
*  mean, it's like, do they have to hear it? Sean Hannity goes, the far left Nancy Pelosi. It's [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3186.44s)]
*  like, how many leftists have you actually talked to in your life? How many leftists have you ever [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3192.84s)]
*  read? You think Nancy Pelosi is a far leftist? Like really? Living on her vineyard in Napa? [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3196.52s)]
*  All these different, you know, these different tools of corporations are left and right, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3202.68s)]
*  but so that's over now and now I think it's just much, it's much tougher to keep this charade going [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3208.44s)]
*  and it seems to be collapsing so fast. Yes, yes. And it's not, again, you could, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3214.04s)]
*  you could be honest about it and kind of maintain some of your respect, but the truth is that, [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3220.12s)]
*  like, look, even when they'll say these things, like if you accuse Ben Shapiro of having dual [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3227.32s)]
*  loyalty, they go, oh, that's an anti-Semitic trope. That means you hate the Jews. But then he'll sit [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3234.44s)]
*  there in his own words and say, I forget his exact quote, but it was something like, my favorite [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3240.44s)]
*  thing about the United States of America is that it protects Israel. And so you're already saying [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3245.7200000000003s)]
*  you have loyalty to both of these countries. In fact, I'm not so sure about one of the loyalties, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3251.48s)]
*  but I'm very sure about the other one. And that is not, I'm sorry, that's not a statement against [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3256.76s)]
*  Jewish people. I'm Jewish. I love Jewish people. You know, it's like I get called a self-hating [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3261.2400000000002s)]
*  Jew on Twitter or whatever. I could not be further from the truth. I actually really love Jewish [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3265.8s)]
*  people. There's many things about Jewish culture that have, you know, had a huge impact on me, [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3269.6400000000003s)]
*  made me the person I am, made me a better person for their, their impact on me. But this is a [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3274.28s)]
*  foreign government. Like, I'm sorry, that's, we're, we're allowed to talk about that. If you, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3280.76s)]
*  you know, I saw Glenn Beck the other day had a Douglas Murray on and he wasn't like, Glenn Beck [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3286.6000000000004s)]
*  wasn't like mean to me personally, but which I appreciated. But he was just going, I mean, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3292.36s)]
*  it was just so ridiculous, but it's like, you were sitting here, we're gonna, we're having a [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3297.96s)]
*  conversation about a foreign government. You started crying on your show, talking about this [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3301.96s)]
*  foreign government. That's fucking weird. That's weird. We should not be doing that. What the hell [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3308.52s)]
*  is going on here? Like, I don't even think you should cry about our own government, you know, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3316.12s)]
*  but if you're going to cry about one, it should be ours. And no, but no, no one would even think to [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3319.96s)]
*  cry about it. Right. I mean, like, come on, like, let's have a real conversation about this. And if [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3323.4s)]
*  you don't, especially, and by the way, this is not my primary goal. My primary goal is to tell the [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3328.36s)]
*  truth and to advocate for what's good for our country. But if you're concerned about like the [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3333.48s)]
*  young men getting a little bit too radical and, and, you know, being too obsessed with the Jews [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3342.28s)]
*  or too against the Jews, which I do think is a legit concern, you know, that's not good for you. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3347.8s)]
*  And it's not good for you. It's not good for the conflict. It's not good for the country. I just [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3352.92s)]
*  don't think any of racial collectivism always leads to bad places. You don't want to, you don't [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3357.56s)]
*  want to embrace that stuff. But if you're concerned about that, well, then the first thing you have to [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3363.88s)]
*  do is tell the truth. You can't keep lying to people and you can't, you can't keep sitting here [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3368.7599999999998s)]
*  and going like, Oh, no, the neo conservative, you can't say neoconservative, right? Isn't that Mark [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3373.4s)]
*  Levin? Didn't he just say if it's the neo-conservative? Mark Levin, who's a, who I also know, I mean, I've [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3377.56s)]
*  been in right wing world my whole life. I know everybody I work with Mark, always gotten along [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3384.76s)]
*  with Mark, always been nice to me. But yeah, he just accused Trump, the Trump administration of [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3388.76s)]
*  anti-Semitism for calling someone a neocon. Well, what he, what he did was he accused Steve Wittkopf [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3393.6400000000003s)]
*  of anti-Semitism. And I just want to say, I think Steve Wittkopf is, if there's anyone who is, you [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3401.0800000000004s)]
*  know, has the hand of God on him, it seems to me, I've sort of overstated, but I feel that way. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3407.4s)]
*  It's Wittkopf, who's a thoroughly decent man. And he was running around the world trying to bring [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3411.64s)]
*  peace between nations. And also, by the way, who single-handedly saved 20 Jewish hostages. Well, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3416.8399999999997s)]
*  exactly. I mean, I don't know if they were all Jewish. I think most of them were, I think almost [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3422.52s)]
*  all of them were, but I think they got 20 hostages released in the phase one of the ceasefire that he [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3426.12s)]
*  worked out. Then Israel violated the ceasefire and so they didn't get the other hostages back, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3430.44s)]
*  although thankfully the American was just released. But this guy, Wittkopf, has actually done more to [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3434.3599999999997s)]
*  help those hostages. So here's what, I mean, here's what he said. I actually wrote this down [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3440.04s)]
*  because I was really bothered by it. This is Levin on Twitter, Mark Levin, who works at Fox, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3444.7599999999998s)]
*  which is like, basically seems to have turned its programming over to advocating for a war with Iran. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3452.68s)]
*  Neocon is a pejorative for Jew. Unbelievable. And this is in response to Wittkopf saying, [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3458.36s)]
*  quote, the Neocon element believes that war is the only way to solve things. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3465.8s)]
*  So you have Mark Levin calling Steve Wittkopf an anti-Semite. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3469.6400000000003s)]
*  Right, right. And again, we've reached peak. I mean, I think, yes, it's again, again, but it's, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3473.32s)]
*  I don't even know. But again, it shouldn't matter. It shouldn't really matter. It doesn't matter. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3479.0s)]
*  He's American and he's on the side of peace. And so I'm for that guy. But you know, the crazy thing. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3483.32s)]
*  So I also, I, at one point in the debate with Douglas Murray, I said something about the [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3489.1600000000003s)]
*  Neoconservatives. And he went, ah, the N word, you know, making a play on the N word or whatever. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3494.6s)]
*  And it's interesting. I mean, Douglas Murray wrote the book called Neoconservatism, Why We Need It. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3500.8399999999997s)]
*  It was his book. And so what happened was for people who don't like know, you know, a lot about [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3508.04s)]
*  this, it's, there was a, this was their term. The Neoconservative was not a pejorative term until [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3513.96s)]
*  the Neoconservatives got control of our foreign policy and ruined everything. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3522.1200000000003s)]
*  And then it became a term that we'll, we'll call every war hawk. We'll be like, oh, another neocon. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3526.36s)]
*  Now, now a lot of times we will use the term when strictly speaking, this person may not have been [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3531.6400000000003s)]
*  a self-identified Neoconservative. It's just become a pejorative for someone trying to get us [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3537.2400000000002s)]
*  in a stupid war. But the Neoconservatives themselves, the original group, this was their name. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3542.36s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3546.92s)]
*  For themselves. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3547.4s)]
*  I was there. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3547.88s)]
*  And you, right, you were there. You worked alongside them. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3548.6000000000004s)]
*  I worked for that. I worked for Bill Kristol for five and a half years. I was a Neocon. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3550.92s)]
*  Yes. It wasn't. And they had no, they had no- [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3555.08s)]
*  Episcopalian Neocon. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3557.08s)]
*  But look, they had no problem using the term until everybody started to hate them. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3559.0s)]
*  And then they went, you can't call us this, but it's like, no, you guys, like this was your own [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3563.2400000000002s)]
*  term that you used for yourself. You can read their own documents and the project for a new [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3569.4s)]
*  American century. You read the clean break memo. They laid out what they wanted their foreign [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3573.4s)]
*  policy to be. I mean, literally, right? Wasn't it, oh God, I can't remember whose quote it was. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3578.36s)]
*  I know that a bunch of them loved sharing it. But what is it that every 10 years, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3584.6s)]
*  we got to throw a small puny little country up against the wall and show them who's boss. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3588.92s)]
*  This was their foreign policy. We need multiple theaters of war in the Middle East [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3593.7200000000003s)]
*  in order to ensure the new century is an American century. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3598.44s)]
*  So immoral and disgusting. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3601.88s)]
*  Yes. And also that, and look, as anybody can read, I think we talked about this last time I was on, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3603.2400000000002s)]
*  but anybody can read for themselves the clean break memo. It was written by Richard Pearl and [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3608.28s)]
*  David Wormser, two Benjamin Netanyahu that was like, look, here is our plan. And the break was [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3613.0s)]
*  from the peace process. The break was from Oslo. And they go, look, here's the plan. You know how [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3618.92s)]
*  Yitzhak Rabin and all these liberal Jews are saying we have to make peace with the Palestinians [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3623.8s)]
*  so that we can then make peace with the broader Arab world? Well, no, we got a new plan. We're [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3629.0s)]
*  going to break with all of that. We're not doing this land swap thing. We're not giving the [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3633.48s)]
*  Palestinians a state. What we'll do is we'll have America overthrow all of these other governments. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3637.08s)]
*  That way you never have to make peace with the Palestinians and you can just enjoy [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3641.96s)]
*  domination over the region. And from my reading of it, it does seem to me that a lot of them [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3646.12s)]
*  believed it. I think a lot of them hubris. Yeah, we overthrow Saddam Hussein. Democracy will sweep [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3651.0s)]
*  the region. Then we'll overthrow Gaddafi. Then we'll overthrow the mullahs in Iran. And then the [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3658.52s)]
*  region will be way better, except every time they actually did it, it resulted in nothing [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3662.68s)]
*  but disaster, which really could have been very easily predicted and was predicted by wiser people [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3666.6s)]
*  than the neocons. But all these years later, you either have to like apologize for your role in [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3672.6s)]
*  this catastrophe or defend your role in this catastrophe and talk about how you still really [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3679.3199999999997s)]
*  believe it was the right thing to do. But you can't sit here and say, you're not an expert and you're [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3684.52s)]
*  a Jew hater if you say the word neoconservative. That's not an appropriate response. But if Mark [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3689.16s)]
*  Levin is calling the Trump administration anti-Semitic Steve Witkoff, we're at the end of [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3695.24s)]
*  something and the beginning of something new. I mean, that's right. Right? I mean, that's so, [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3701.64s)]
*  I almost called Mark when I saw it because I really, I know him, but I really love Steve [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3707.56s)]
*  Witkoff and I think his decency, I don't agree with him on everything at all, but his decency is just [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3712.7599999999998s)]
*  palpable. I mean, it just comes through his concern for people. His reasonableness is just so obvious [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3718.92s)]
*  and the effects of what he's done have been so great and great for America, great for the world. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3725.48s)]
*  So I almost, I was so offended. And then I thought I'm not going to solve anything by calling Mark [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3728.68s)]
*  Levin and scolding him. Are we screaming at me? But I did think like, he's not stupid. If you're [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3734.44s)]
*  saying, if you're calling Steve Witkoff an anti-Semite on Twitter, like, you know you're losing, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3742.36s)]
*  right? Is that what that is? And it's such a, you know, in the, what's weird is that at the same time, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3747.08s)]
*  because I know all of these people, they'll be lecturing me about how I don't understand like the [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3753.72s)]
*  gravity of anti-Semitism. And it's like, no, actually I kind of do. And I would never just [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3760.44s)]
*  throw the accusation around like that. I'm very hesitant to ever call any person a bigot or a Jew [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3767.24s)]
*  hater or racist or any of these things, because it's like you're intentionally trying to [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3773.88s)]
*  dehumanize them on the accusation that they're dehumanizing others. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3780.76s)]
*  It's scaring the crap out of people. I'm getting texts from people I really love personally, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3784.52s)]
*  who are very, very, you know, who aren't paying a lot of attention. They just hear that there's [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3789.0s)]
*  anti-Semitism and I'm part of it and hurts their feelings and they're confused and upset. And it's [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3793.32s)]
*  like it, it has such a divisive effect. Yeah. Like for real. And it's- [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3798.28s)]
*  I'm a little bit concerned. Okay, so it's time for intervention. All your loved ones are here. We're [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3804.84s)]
*  here to tell you it is time to stop overpaying for your phone. Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, there's a way [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3809.88s)]
*  better way to do this. It's called PureTalk. PureTalk is a wireless company created by Americans, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3816.2000000000003s)]
*  for Americans. It offers reliable coverage, excellent service, and it's the smart way to [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3822.0400000000004s)]
*  cut costs without giving up quality. Qualifying plans start at just 35 bucks a month. You get [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3827.48s)]
*  unlimited talk, text, 15 gigs of data, a mobile hotspot on the most dependable 5G network in the [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3833.72s)]
*  United States. And if you join today, they throw in a Samsung Galaxy for free, actually for free. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3840.52s)]
*  There's no weird hidden fees or charges that you don't see at first. Legitimately free, no dollars. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3846.04s)]
*  So do yourself a favor, cut your cell phone bill in half, at least with PureTalk. Go to [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3851.56s)]
*  puretalk.com slash tucker to claim your free Galaxy Samsung phone with a qualifying plan. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3855.88s)]
*  We can tell you it's a good deal and you'll be happy you did it. Yeah, I mean, I'm concerned [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3861.8s)]
*  about all of it. None of it's particularly good. But there's also something which is, it's interesting [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3866.04s)]
*  to me as somebody who is, I am not a conservative. I mean, I'm a bit of a right winger, but I'm not a [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3872.44s)]
*  conservative. I'm kind of a radical libertarian. And I kind of, you know, if Tom Tillis is what a [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3877.48s)]
*  conservative is, I'm not a- Yeah, right. I mean, there are some, as a libertarian, [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3882.76s)]
*  there certainly are some things that I think ought be conserved. You know, I think like the [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3887.48s)]
*  Bill of Rights and our traditions and I think Christianity, I think there's a lot of things [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3892.6800000000003s)]
*  that should be conserved. But it's so bizarre to me that now that I'm at this level where it's like [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3897.5600000000004s)]
*  I'm talking or talking to, but being lectured to by the leaders of Conservatism, Inc. and I have to [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3904.1200000000003s)]
*  explain to them that like, I don't believe in moral relativism. Like, as if this is like a new [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3910.76s)]
*  thing for them to wrap their head around. And that- [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3919.0800000000004s)]
*  You've gotten calls from Conn Inc. trying to bring you into line? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3921.6400000000003s)]
*  I've gotten, for the first time in my career, really, I've gotten a few of the calls. But I mean, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3924.6800000000003s)]
*  it's, I'm too far gone for them. You know, if you were going to get me to sell out, you would have [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3930.6800000000003s)]
*  had to get me a while ago. You just shouldn't have let me- [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3935.88s)]
*  Too late! [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3938.44s)]
*  Well, it is. I remember, so when I, this is like, I want to say like 2000, 2014, 2015. It was [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3939.4s)]
*  somewhere in there where I started, the first time I ever got on television, the first person who [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3946.28s)]
*  ever put me on TV was Kennedy, who I just adore and will for the rest of my days. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3950.44s)]
*  Sweet girl. I agree. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3956.6s)]
*  Just like one of the sweetest, kindest, really funny, really smart, weirdly smart. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3957.6400000000003s)]
*  But like when I say weirdly smart, I mean, weirdly smart, like knows about stuff that [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3963.56s)]
*  no one should know about and then has like a lot of information about it. She's a wonderful [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3967.96s)]
*  person. So she was a, she put me on Fox Business and then Greg Gutfeld and Tom Shalhou, who was [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3971.64s)]
*  hosting Red Eye at the time, they started using me on their Fox News shows. And so it was like [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3980.12s)]
*  the first time in my career I had like started getting on TV. And I remember a few people at Fox [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3983.88s)]
*  and told me that they were like, hey, there's like, some people in management are like [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3989.7200000000003s)]
*  interested in you. Like they're taking some interest in you. And then it was kind of [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=3995.2400000000002s)]
*  explained to me, not like ever directly, but it was like, you're a little out there for Fox News. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4000.36s)]
*  And I remember at the time I was broke. I mean, dead broke. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4007.4s)]
*  Only on, just to be, put a finer point on that. What do they mean? Not in your personal life, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4012.36s)]
*  your personal life, more buttoned down than most people who work with you. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4016.68s)]
*  Well, at the time it wasn't, this is before I was married and had kids and stuff. But that's, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4019.3999999999996s)]
*  believe me, that's not what they care about. I found out pretty quickly by just doing shows [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4022.52s)]
*  at Fox News and then going to the bar afterward with some of the people there, you're like, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4027.56s)]
*  oh, conservatism, Inc. is not exactly what you thought. They're actually pretty liberal [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4031.16s)]
*  when it comes down to the bar hang after the show. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4035.56s)]
*  I would say. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4038.12s)]
*  But it was, I was Ron Paul guy and I was younger. So I was a more, [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4038.8399999999997s)]
*  Ron Paul was a country doctor wearing a suit and tie. I was like a kid from Brooklyn who was like, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4047.24s)]
*  you're all a bunch of killers. This is all bullshit. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4051.3199999999997s)]
*  It was the foreign policy stuff. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4053.7999999999997s)]
*  It was all the foreign policy stuff, as it always is. That's always what it's really all about. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4054.9199999999996s)]
*  And I don't say that because I want it to be the case. It's just the fact that that's always [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4060.2799999999997s)]
*  really what it's all about. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4063.16s)]
*  It took me 40 years to figure this out, but yes, that's what it's about. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4063.96s)]
*  That's right. You're correct. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4066.04s)]
*  By the way, all of these even debates today, the people on Twitter talking about the woke right, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4067.08s)]
*  it just happens to be that everyone who's labeled woke right are the ones who are opposing [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4073.08s)]
*  American wars and everybody who's throwing out the accusation all happen to support them. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4077.96s)]
*  What's woke right? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a nonsense term that they're trying to say. It's totally ridiculous. But let me just, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4082.92s)]
*  on the Fox news thing. So I remember then, and this is, I was broke. I mean like broke, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4090.04s)]
*  where they're like, hey, let's go grab a beer after the show. I'm like, all right, are you buying? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4096.2s)]
*  Because if not, let's go grab a six pack at the store and go back to my apartment. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4100.84s)]
*  I just had no money. And I would have, at the time when they said, they were like, look, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4105.32s)]
*  they're thinking about you for one of these contributorships, whatever it is, it may give [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4109.96s)]
*  you like a hundred grand a year or something like that if you get one. It would have been like [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4113.88s)]
*  life changing for me, life changing. And I remember consciously at the time, thinking, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4116.92s)]
*  at a time when I'm making 25 grand a year, thinking, man, maybe I just don't talk about [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4122.36s)]
*  the foreign policy stuff. Maybe I just do that. And then even in the moment I thought about it, [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4127.56s)]
*  just being like, now Ron Paul's my hero. My hero are the people who tell the truth. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4131.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4136.28s)]
*  So like, I'm just not going to, but so if I didn't sell out then, the idea that I'm going to sell out [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4136.52s)]
*  now when I'm doing really well, it's like, no, that's ridiculous. Like, you know what I'm saying? [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4142.76s)]
*  It's like, that's insane. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4149.0s)]
*  It was just funny that I think that Murray thought he was administering the kill shot. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4151.0s)]
*  I think that's what it was supposed to be. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4157.64s)]
*  But the opposite happened. It's like, and not to brag, I knew this as I was watching it. I was like, [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4159.320000000001s)]
*  Dave is about to become way more famous, but not just famous, more authoritative, more respected, [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4166.360000000001s)]
*  more closely listened to than ever before. Has that been your experience? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4173.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's essentially just done nothing except make me bigger. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4176.76s)]
*  Did you pay Douglas to do that? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4182.2s)]
*  I did not. I don't have that type of money to target. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4185.64s)]
*  Did you throw the fight out for a bit? [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4187.64s)]
*  I wish I had that. I'm doing okay. I don't have money like that. I don't have buy off [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4189.72s)]
*  Douglas Murray money. I don't think it would take too much. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4192.68s)]
*  Well, it's not just, one of the things that was interesting is that it's not just, [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4196.360000000001s)]
*  so there was the debate, there was the reaction to the debate. But then what was really interesting [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4201.400000000001s)]
*  is that then there was the reaction to, just because it became such a big thing, [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4206.52s)]
*  it ended up coming up on Rogan's podcast with other guests later on. And they're all just [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4210.200000000001s)]
*  kind of making fun of Douglas and how ridiculous he was, because he was ridiculous. And then [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4215.080000000001s)]
*  it's almost like you see the realization set in with those people that, oh shit, Joe was, [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4220.92s)]
*  what essentially happened here, right? And this is, I think for almost everyone to see, is that [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4226.76s)]
*  I've been debating all these guys on Israel-Palestine and I've been beating all these [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4233.48s)]
*  guys in these debates. And I'm not saying I'm beating, I'm just saying the reaction, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4237.0s)]
*  the Oxford-style voting is that I win dominantly. And then Douglas Murray was almost brought in as [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4240.36s)]
*  the king boss. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4246.44s)]
*  Dad's here. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4247.719999999999s)]
*  Right. I mean, Ben Shapiro's not going to do it. He's not going to come debate me. And so who is [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4248.36s)]
*  it? Who's the best guy to come debate? Well, here's Douglas Murray, the guy who's just known [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4253.799999999999s)]
*  for his prose and his rhetoric and how good he is at debating. I mean, this is what he's known for. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4258.76s)]
*  And then he came in and couldn't lay a land a blow. He couldn't take on one argument. He had to just [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4264.280000000001s)]
*  be resorted to like, it was like you were debating an anti-racist college professor on what, who's [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4269.96s)]
*  just going to tell you the whole time that I'm not even allowed to have this opinion. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4275.96s)]
*  Yes. It was just that. And so then what do you think the response to that was? [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4279.08s)]
*  Here's, here you have Joe Rogan, who has got some of these guys on his show, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4283.24s)]
*  who clearly are making a case where he goes, all right, yeah, this is a pretty good argument [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4287.16s)]
*  that this guy's making. And he brought, you know, as much as Douglas was complaining in his op-eds [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4290.28s)]
*  after the fact that it's so unfair that I couldn't just go on alone. I had to go on with this guy who [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4296.44s)]
*  doesn't know what he's talking about. It's like, yeah, but this was your opportunity, man. You [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4301.32s)]
*  could have blown me out of the water. And then had Rogan being like, ah, shit, maybe I should have [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4304.84s)]
*  more experts on. Like maybe I've got this comedian guy who I think is making really good points. But [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4310.68s)]
*  then this guy just came in and like totally took him on. And, but he was unwilling or unable to do [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4314.84s)]
*  that. And so that was the next freak out is they realized that like, oh, Joe just got pushed more [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4320.68s)]
*  in my direction as his whole audience did. I wonder though, if there's not something a little [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4326.92s)]
*  more sinister underneath that. I mean, you keep referring to this as a debate, but it wasn't, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4332.360000000001s)]
*  no, it was not a debate. It was Douglas trying to scold Joe into never having you or anyone like you [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4336.92s)]
*  on his show again. It was basically he was playing the heavy. Yeah. It was kind of threatening. I [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4344.12s)]
*  thought like, you know, you don't really know because you were a sitcom actor slash comedian [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4349.08s)]
*  slash bow hunter that actually you're playing with some pretty serious shit, Joe Rogan. And we've [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4353.88s)]
*  been watching and maybe you should stop having these people on. Yeah. That was definitely the [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4358.84s)]
*  vibe I got from it. Oh, no question. It was, they even use the word when he was talking to Barry Weiss, [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4363.0s)]
*  you know, that embodiment of expertise that is Barry Weiss. They were talking and he used the [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4369.64s)]
*  word platforming that Joe shouldn't be platforming all of these people. It's like, okay, so you're, [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4377.16s)]
*  look, I'm saying this is just animal farm. We're at the end of animal farm where the pigs and the [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4382.52s)]
*  people are indistinguishable. Like if you're a conservative, using the word platform as a verb. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4387.08s)]
*  Yeah. Like how long before you call me a white supremacist actually, which essentially I guess, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4392.4400000000005s)]
*  white supremacist isn't the term, but anti-Semite is the term that they're going with. It's the [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4397.64s)]
*  exact same playbook. And then they have the balls to whip around and call you woke, right? [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4401.64s)]
*  Yes, that's right. I'm like, right. It's Bill Kristol calling me, you know, calling for an [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4407.320000000001s)]
*  ethnostase. Yes, it's all the same thing, right? You're sitting here. We have in this country right [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4412.92s)]
*  now, we have speech laws being passed, you know, in the name of students feeling not safe on college [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4418.04s)]
*  campuses. And you get the accusation of bigotry used to shut down real dissent and real conversations. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4425.64s)]
*  And then they're going to turn around and say the other side is woke. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4432.76s)]
*  So that's when I stopped laughing. That, I mean, that is shocking to me. And the fact that the [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4436.84s)]
*  Congress had scheduled it was thanks to Marjorie Taylor Greene, it was pulled off the schedule, but [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4443.400000000001s)]
*  God bless her. But there was- What a weird world we're in. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4448.280000000001s)]
*  Who really is- Where she's the savior. Marjorie Taylor Greene is who- [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4451.64s)]
*  That's where we're at. You know why? Because Marjorie is totally sincere. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4454.76s)]
*  Yeah. She's actually not a liar. She's sincere. That's what they hate her. But there was a law [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4457.400000000001s)]
*  vote scheduled on a bill that would have made it a felony for Americans to participate in a boycott [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4464.280000000001s)]
*  of Israel. And as someone who has zero interest in participating in any kind of boycott, much less [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4470.04s)]
*  against Israel, I'm just not interested. I'm happy. Whatever. Buy the hummus and use the software. I [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4475.08s)]
*  don't care. But I probably would have engaged in one just to make the point that I'm a free man [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4479.72s)]
*  in a free country. And we can't- How could you even consider voting on something like that? [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4486.76s)]
*  And isn't the most outrageous part of it, or at least to me, I mean, I guess it's all outrageous, [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4491.16s)]
*  but the most- The crazy thing is that we've, and we've seen this in the last decade, where [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4496.360000000001s)]
*  Hollywood types and big musicians would boycott red states. If they tried to pass a six-week [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4504.92s)]
*  heartbeat bill for abortion. Or the bathroom bill. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4511.72s)]
*  Yeah, boycott. So you could boycott states in our own country, but you can't boycott a foreign [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4515.0s)]
*  country. It's like the double standard there. Again, this is why I said the thing about [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4521.24s)]
*  relativism. Because in the same way that people will talk about constantly, and the same people [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4527.24s)]
*  who will harp on anti-Semitism on Twitter. And I'm not denying, something's going on there. Clearly. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4534.44s)]
*  There's a real thing happening here. Big time. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4542.44s)]
*  And it's not, as I've said, and again, this isn't necessarily the most important aspect to it, but [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4544.12s)]
*  personally, one of the things that annoys me about that is it's not helping my argument. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4550.04s)]
*  No. It's an albatross around my neck. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4554.76s)]
*  Agreed. And it's the reason why every [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4557.48s)]
*  goddamn debate that I'm in, the first thing they're going to bring up is, well, look at all these [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4559.24s)]
*  people on Twitter who are saying all this stuff. So I wish those people would knock it off. But [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4562.92s)]
*  you also, okay, we don't need two standards here. One standard will do just fine. Let's have one [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4567.8s)]
*  standard and apply this across the board. Because the amount of anti-Muslim bigotry, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4574.44s)]
*  anti-Palestinian bigotry, dehumanizing of the entire Palestinian people. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4579.64s)]
*  Sam Harris is engaged in for 20 years. Yeah, that's right. And then they're going [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4584.04s)]
*  to turn around and be like, oh my God, there's all this dehumanizing bigotry out there. It's like, [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4587.56s)]
*  yeah, none of that is good. None of that is good. It's not good for you. It's not good for the [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4592.4400000000005s)]
*  conversation. It's just bad. You don't want to dehumanize an entire group of people ever. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4597.320000000001s)]
*  You want to be human beings like human beings. Yes. And that should be fairly obvious. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4601.64s)]
*  But also, I will say that Donald Trump, who I voted for and supported in this last election, [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4605.64s)]
*  and I think has done some really good things in his first 100 days or so, and some not so good [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4613.320000000001s)]
*  things. But he would turn in the debate and call Joe Biden a Palestinian. He said this about Chuck [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4618.4400000000005s)]
*  Schumer too. He's basically a Palestinian. You're like, whoa. And for all the people who have been [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4626.360000000001s)]
*  screaming bigotry for the last decade, no one ever thought to be like, hey, you know, that's not [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4631.24s)]
*  like an insult. It's not an insult to call someone a Palestinian. I've met lots of Palestinians who [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4635.96s)]
*  are really great people. There's nothing wrong with them. And again, if a presidential candidate [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4641.0s)]
*  ever stood up in the debate and went, ah, this guy's a real Jew, we'd all be like, whoa, what [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4646.84s)]
*  the hell is that? You don't get to say that in a political debate. And so there's a ton of this. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4651.5599999999995s)]
*  You have Nikki Haley going over and signing bombs. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4657.24s)]
*  It's hard to overstate how much I hate that, by the way. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4662.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, right. And I mean- [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4664.6s)]
*  There are a lot of unreasonable Palestinians, of course. There are also some wonderful, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4666.76s)]
*  a lot of Christian Palestinians, a lot of wonderful Muslim Palestinians. So I hate that. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4671.24s)]
*  Yeah, it's terrible. Yeah, it's terrible. It's terrible on any side. You don't dehumanize people [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4677.96s)]
*  like that. Yeah. And so what's his name? I'm blanking. What's that? The congressman in [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4682.12s)]
*  Florida, Randy Fine, is Fine his last name? Who's that guy? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4688.12s)]
*  I don't know, but did you see the stuff he's posted? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4691.24s)]
*  He's like a nut job. Oh my God. It's just, you know. So again, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4693.16s)]
*  okay, you want to talk about- He's the one who's like, we want to kill [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4696.68s)]
*  all their children or something? Yeah. Well, someone basically like, I think [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4699.08s)]
*  someone tweeted like a picture of a dead Palestinian baby and he said like, good, we need more or [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4702.04s)]
*  something like that. It was something really close to that. I don't want to get this wrong. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4707.8s)]
*  Who could vote for someone like that? Trump endorsed him after that. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4711.32s)]
*  After he said it was good that a baby was dead? I mean, you know, again- [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4715.88s)]
*  I would love to have him on and just ask him about that. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4718.92s)]
*  Pull up the actual tweet on that because I don't want to like, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4720.12s)]
*  misremember it, but it was something really egregious. And he's, you know, there's just, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4722.36s)]
*  look, there's a lot of this stuff. It's how you get Nikki Haley signing bombs that are about to [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4726.84s)]
*  go get dropped on women and children. You're like, I'm sorry, that's fucking sickening. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4731.719999999999s)]
*  Like, what the hell is that? Like, what are we, a part of some death cult or something? I mean, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4736.36s)]
*  and so of course then, you know, Douglas Murray's book is like democracies and death [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4741.88s)]
*  cults or whatever. And which is kind of funny in a way to be pro democracies while you're also [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4746.68s)]
*  making the argument for expertise. Because you would think like if you're for democracy, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4754.92s)]
*  the whole point of this, the whole point of experts is to explain it to regular people [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4760.28s)]
*  who will ultimately have the authority of deciding which experts are in charge and which [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4764.6s)]
*  experts are not in charge. You know, there's a little contradiction there, but again, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4769.24s)]
*  this is my issue. And this is where I think Tucker, in some way we're really like kindred spirits. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4773.0s)]
*  What a higher IQ you have than Douglas Murray. It just cracks me up. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4779.0s)]
*  Well, he's, he's, he's got a very high verbal IQ. He's more talented in a lot of ways than me. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4782.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm just, I'm, I'm telling the truth. No, no, but I mean, that's such a deep [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4787.16s)]
*  contradiction that I doubt he's aware of. Probably not. But I will say this, and this [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4792.36s)]
*  is where I think in some ways this is why me and you always get along. I think we're kindred [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4797.32s)]
*  spirits in this way in some sense, but I really do. I mean this, I mean this so sincerely in my soul, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4801.08s)]
*  in my heart of hearts, I'm a crotchety old right winger. Like that's who I want to be. Okay. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4808.04s)]
*  That's what I try my best. I want to be, I, I'm, I'm not just like a, a Western chauvinist or [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4814.12s)]
*  whatever. Like I think Western society is better than everything else. I think it's, I'm a libertarian [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4821.96s)]
*  and I think it's one of the goofiest things about libertarians in general, that they kind of try to [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4827.0s)]
*  run away from that and be egalitarian to some degree. That's ridiculous. What do you tell you? [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4831.0s)]
*  You believe in individual liberty? Well, then you don't get to say every civilization is equal [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4835.48s)]
*  because only one of them respects individual liberty and that's the better one. Okay. That's [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4839.32s)]
*  the, I, I, that's right. So screw all this other egalitarianism is a revolt against nature. As the [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4844.12s)]
*  great Murray Rothbard wrote, it's, I'm against all of that. I don't believe in relativism. I don't [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4850.92s)]
*  believe in all cultures are equal. I would like to sit here and look down on the Muslim world. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4855.96s)]
*  That's what I would like to do because my society is so much better. And if anything, I'd be [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4861.56s)]
*  lecturing you, you guys got to do Liberty better. You guys don't really even understand how a free [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4865.72s)]
*  society works. I'd like to be there. That's actually what I once was. That's what confirms my bias is [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4869.96s)]
*  like stuff like that. The problem is I just know too much about our government and what our [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4876.2s)]
*  government's done to these people and not just what we've done to them, but that we've been [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4880.2s)]
*  propping up the Islamists for 40 years. Literally. And so what are we talking about here? You can't [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4883.88s)]
*  then turn around and go, look at them. They're a bunch of Islamists. No, I know what you did. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4889.0s)]
*  You propped up the Islamists so you didn't have to deal with the commies. Like regardless of any of [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4892.84s)]
*  that, I just, again, I insist on one standard for everything. If you're going to say Hamas is a [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4897.400000000001s)]
*  death cult, what the hell is the U S government? What is the Israeli government? You get to sit [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4902.92s)]
*  here as my government has in the last 25 years destroyed Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Libya, Somalia, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4908.5199999999995s)]
*  Yemen, Ukraine, and now Gaza. That's what my government's done. I don't get to call someone [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4917.08s)]
*  else a death cult. I'd like to. I'd like to just look down at them as a death cult, but sorry, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4923.639999999999s)]
*  we're the biggest purveyors of violence in the world, not Vladimir Putin. And like again, it's [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4929.16s)]
*  just, if you look at these things, you just have to have one standard and apply them across the [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4934.68s)]
*  board. This is what I've been arguing the whole time. And if you're going to say it's like, okay, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4939.08s)]
*  October 7th was horrible. It was absolutely horrible. Why was it horrible? Oh yeah, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4943.320000000001s)]
*  because intentionally killing innocent civilians is like one of the most evil things you could ever [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4948.280000000001s)]
*  do. Okay then. Because people are what matter in the end. Right. And all your theories are valid [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4953.400000000001s)]
*  to the extent that they serve people. And when they hurt people, then they're invalid, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4962.92s)]
*  I think. Yeah, I think so. So you said that there's this brand new media landscape, information [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4967.64s)]
*  landscape, possibility of true free thinking and free speech. I think it's all true because the old [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4974.92s)]
*  control system has shattered, as you said. So we're living in this just incredible moment. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4981.16s)]
*  How long can it last? That's a good question. It's very hard to make predictions because it's [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4988.04s)]
*  such a new model. And it's like, we really don't know much about this. One of the things that I [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=4996.599999999999s)]
*  find that I'm, which you never want to get ahead of yourself, especially these days, and there's [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5002.28s)]
*  so many things that could happen that it's kind of impossible to even know what 2028 looks like. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5007.4s)]
*  Yes. But so I'm assuming right now JD Vance is probably going to be the guy. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5013.5599999999995s)]
*  Hope so. Yeah, I hope so too. And so you look at this dynamic where you go, okay, so part of, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5018.36s)]
*  so you look at Kamala Harris's campaign and say Joe Biden the same way and Joe Biden specifically [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5027.16s)]
*  because he was senile, not, you know, Joe Biden, younger Joe Biden, while he was never a very [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5032.36s)]
*  bright guy, maybe would have been a little bit different politically. But Kamala Harris, so she [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5036.759999999999s)]
*  famously, infamously now turned down the Joe Rogan experience. She could have been on the show, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5043.64s)]
*  but she didn't. Now, a lot of people were saying, oh, what a stupid move turning that down. I kind [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5048.04s)]
*  of disagree. I go, it probably was the right move. For sure. If you had no soul and you're working [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5054.84s)]
*  for the Kamala Harris campaign and your only objective in this world was to get her elected [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5061.08s)]
*  and that invite came in, you're probably going, no, no, no, no, no, no, you will be exposed. You [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5064.76s)]
*  can't go do this. The fact is that Kamala Harris by the nature of who she is as a person and by the [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5071.0s)]
*  nature of what she was running on is not built for a three hour unedited, unscripted conversation. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5078.52s)]
*  No, no. You can't do that. You know, like say whatever you will about Donald Trump. The man's [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5086.76s)]
*  got a lot of flaws, but he is built for that. He could do eight hours, I think, easily, you know, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5090.52s)]
*  like he's without going to the bathroom. Right. Yeah. Which is what I heard. And Joe said he [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5094.92s)]
*  didn't go before or after. True. I've never done the Joe Rogan experience and not gone to the bathroom [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5099.8s)]
*  before or after. There's the mid break leak always. Yeah, of course. This is insane. The guy's not [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5104.12s)]
*  human. It's unbelievable. But okay, so going just into 2028, think about what a change this is. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5107.88s)]
*  This is the new standard to be a presidential candidate. You have to be able to go and do a [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5117.16s)]
*  three hour podcast and actually probably several of them. Right. I mean, Trump did a whole bunch of [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5122.52s)]
*  them before he got elected and she didn't and lost. That's it. And so that in itself just changes [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5127.24s)]
*  everything. Now we have to actually see who you are as a person, you know, because it doesn't even [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5134.04s)]
*  matter. It doesn't even matter what you're talking about for three hours. It doesn't even matter if [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5139.5599999999995s)]
*  you're getting grilled. So true. It's just, I get to see who you are. And it comes out. So, okay. No one [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5143.24s)]
*  can play a role for three hours. Right. So that's the new normal. You know, that's that in itself is [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5150.04s)]
*  a huge transformation. I think that has to be stopped. I think that has to be stopped. And [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5156.04s)]
*  you know, I don't want to be like too paranoid. But one of the I think some of the the anger and [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5162.84s)]
*  the hate online is, you know, is organic. And it's rooted in frustration and facts in some cases. And [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5169.24s)]
*  you know, I'm not, it's not all bad. But some of it is so clearly inorganic. It just obviously is [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5177.24s)]
*  that you sort of wonder like, is this all a pretext for shutting it down? I just can't escape that. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5186.92s)]
*  Yeah, I get your point. And certainly, you know, like, I never know what is, you know, a pretext [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5192.36s)]
*  or what is not. But it's certainly like, oh, this is going to be used that way. So like, that's [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5202.12s)]
*  another thing. It's very short sighted. You know, for anyone, you know, it's kind of like, nobody ever, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5206.68s)]
*  which I get it, it's a little bit difficult to do, because it's like second or third order [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5213.8s)]
*  thinking. But no one ever kind of thinks about like, what the reaction is going to be. So what [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5218.04s)]
*  they're doing, it's just whether they can get away with it in the moment. But it's not the fact that [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5223.320000000001s)]
*  it's like, hey, there is going to be a correction for this and almost certainly an over correction, [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5227.0s)]
*  because that's always the case. You know, it doesn't seem like any of those leftists ever [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5231.56s)]
*  thought about when they were pushing like all the trans and the kids stuff, they'd be like, [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5236.280000000001s)]
*  what do you think the result of this is going to be? You go, oh, here's the result. Donald Trump [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5240.120000000001s)]
*  winning every swing state. That's the result. Oh, and a handmaid's tale, like ultimately, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5243.96s)]
*  we're going to have Sharia law. Well, it's, but it does, you know, it's, and then, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5250.200000000001s)]
*  and then people are like, really, how did the Muslims take over Europe because Europe went [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5255.160000000001s)]
*  tranny? That's right. Right, right, right. You're going to see white girls begging for Sharia law. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5258.68s)]
*  By the end, of course, of course, there's like, there's many factors involved, but there's no [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5264.12s)]
*  question that there are these, these cycles. And I do think there's, there's an onus on say people [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5268.76s)]
*  who do, you know, want who were against the censorship regime and were against or are against [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5278.04s)]
*  the U S is Israeli, you know, special relationship. It's like, okay, but if you've got the freedom to [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5285.4s)]
*  actually speak about this now, understand a couple things, understand that like you're getting [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5291.32s)]
*  something that generations before you, they never had generations before you there. Your career would [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5296.2s)]
*  have been ruined. You never would have been allowed to say these things. And there does, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5301.24s)]
*  that carries with it a responsibility. You know, it carries with it a responsibility to do this in a [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5305.799999999999s)]
*  way that like, number one, you're getting it right. You're not being sloppy. You're not leading [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5310.68s)]
*  people down a bad path. Right. You're not demonizing people who don't deserve to be demonized, who are [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5317.08s)]
*  not a part of this. And ultimately that you won't be handing the excuse to the other side, who [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5322.84s)]
*  obviously, as you said, needs to rein this in, they need, these guys cannot compete in a free market. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5328.84s)]
*  And so they have to rig the market in their favor. They had forever. They had the market rigged in [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5335.08s)]
*  their favor for the first time. Now they kind of don't, they still do a little bit, but they don't [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5339.56s)]
*  in terms of the conversation. They still certainly do in terms of the power of government, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5344.6s)]
*  but they don't in terms of the conversation. It's like, okay, what do you want to do with that now? [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5348.84s)]
*  The problem is that so much has been hidden either intentionally or just through kind of the veil [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5354.120000000001s)]
*  of misdirection. The people are learning a lot of stuff at once. Yeah. And it's frying some circuits. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5361.56s)]
*  And I think the thing that I try to meditate on every single day is that I am commanded to and [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5367.4s)]
*  intend to treat each individual as an individual, period, period. Yeah. And when you do that, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5373.96s)]
*  it keeps you from going totally insane. And it also opens you up to the beauty of life, to the [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5381.5599999999995s)]
*  joy of life, which is being surprised by people and their complexity, good and bad. And like the [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5386.839999999999s)]
*  capacity of someone like Steve Wittkopf to like do stuff. If you'd asked me, can Wittkopf do that? [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5391.16s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, I knew Wittkopf before, but like, look what Wittkopf is doing. It's incredible. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5396.52s)]
*  I don't know. It's just treat people as individuals. You're commanded to do that. And I do think it's [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5401.0s)]
*  harder to do that online. Yes, I agree. And I also, you know, it was weird because, so I, you know, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5406.040000000001s)]
*  it was an interesting experience for me this last month or so, because I've never really, you know, [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5413.0s)]
*  I'm, I think this has helped me in my career is that I didn't like, I didn't blow up out of nowhere. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5418.200000000001s)]
*  Like I know other people who have in comedy. I know people who like, you know, just like exploded, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5424.92s)]
*  you know, they were in open mics with me and then they got an audition for Saturday Night Live and [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5429.88s)]
*  then they got it. And now they're world famous. You know, you go literally from being a complete [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5434.4400000000005s)]
*  unknown, not even an established comedian, a newer comedian who can't even work the clubs to being [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5438.92s)]
*  like world famous. I've seen people have that. How'd that work for Britney Spears? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5444.2s)]
*  It's not good. Especially bad when you're young. That's the worst time for it to happen. It happened [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5448.92s)]
*  to me. Right. Yeah. Well, that's right. You, you had that. Luckily I was humiliated along the way. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5452.36s)]
*  So well, that'd be more normal, but that's the antidote for it in a weird way. Right. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5456.92s)]
*  Cause it's all ego stuff. So that antidote for blowing up your ego is destroying your ego, [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5461.719999999999s)]
*  which is, is very painful, but it's good. Like a hangover, the hangover is actually getting you [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5467.08s)]
*  healthy. It sucks, but the hangover is the cure. It's getting drunk was the problem. It's hard to [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5471.32s)]
*  become addicted to cocaine. People seem to pull it off anyway, but I never understood that. How [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5475.799999999999s)]
*  could you get addicted to this? You feel horrible. I know it is. Well, that's right. Sorry. Sorry. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5479.48s)]
*  No, but that's, that's exactly right. But so, okay. So for me, I w it was always like a, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5484.839999999999s)]
*  like a logical progression, like one step more, one step more. My profile kind of rose, but this, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5489.639999999999s)]
*  you know, this thing was the biggest thing I've ever done in my career. It was like the biggest [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5495.879999999999s)]
*  reaction to any show or any debate that I've ever done. Cause it was on Rogan's podcast and he [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5500.2s)]
*  doesn't usually do debates and it was the most contentious issue of our day. So it became this [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5506.2s)]
*  big thing. And now I'm at a place where, you know, I'm 42, I have a great wife. I got two little kids [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5510.76s)]
*  that I play with every day. I have a nice house. My life is like set up. I'm, I'm an adult. This [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5518.28s)]
*  isn't so, but when the kind of hate attack, this coordinated attack and everyone who's attacking me [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5525.4s)]
*  just happens to have like, you know, their name written in Hebrew letters and a Jewish star, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5533.0s)]
*  you know, in their bio and they're all saying the most vicious stuff. I've been sitting here [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5537.8s)]
*  and I'm like, wow, dude, if I were 25 and I wasn't Jewish, I could very easily see my response to [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5542.68s)]
*  this. Just being like, man, screw these people, you know? And like, now I'm not saying that would be [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5550.92s)]
*  correct, but it's just like, you feel that because that's the impulse when you're like, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5559.0s)]
*  attack. But like what you just said, I think is the key point, which is that like if believing [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5563.32s)]
*  in individualism is like a grounding force, it kind of inoculates you against collectivist nonsense. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5567.8s)]
*  And when I say that, see, one of the problems here now is that the left, which is what they do, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5575.0s)]
*  is they attack terms and concepts. And so whenever you think about something, you start thinking [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5580.52s)]
*  about the lefty version of it and it's like, no, no, no, not that at all. So the left kind of made [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5585.8s)]
*  individualism, they kind of mixed it together with like this like self-actualization type thing, [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5591.24s)]
*  like, oh, all that really matters is like whatever you're feeling and whatever you're feeling is [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5598.52s)]
*  correct. And it's correct because you're feeling it and you're feeling it because it's correct. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5603.400000000001s)]
*  And that's like, that's like the devil. That's like, you do not want to go down that path. You [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5607.4800000000005s)]
*  do not want to ever say that like, well, if you feel something inside of you, then that must be [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5611.56s)]
*  true. That's essentially what the trans thing was all based on. It was this view that, well, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5615.4s)]
*  if you feel it, then it must be true. Like, that's not where you want. That's the path to hell. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5620.04s)]
*  You don't want to go down that path. No, it's not true that because you feel something, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5624.839999999999s)]
*  therefore should be actualized. And that's terrible. However, more old school individualism, [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5630.5199999999995s)]
*  like in the classical liberal enlightenment tradition, is understanding that the individual [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5637.16s)]
*  is a unit of analysis, that the individuals are how we exist. We act as individuals. We suffer [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5642.280000000001s)]
*  as individuals. We collectivize as individuals. We are born and die as individuals. Exactly. And [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5650.6s)]
*  that collectivism, what collectivism used to mean was the idea that the individual ought to be [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5657.320000000001s)]
*  subservient to the larger group. Not that groups don't exist. Not that we shouldn't come together. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5663.88s)]
*  Of course, we create families. We create churches, communities. All of these things are wonderful. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5669.88s)]
*  But when you do understand true individualism, like that individuals ought to have rights, [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5675.32s)]
*  things like that, it does, it shields you from a lot of this nonsense. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5682.04s)]
*  Well, the question is, does the human being have a soul? [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5687.16s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5690.6s)]
*  Something that is distinct from all others. There are billions of human beings in this world. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5691.32s)]
*  You are fundamentally different, not just in your fingerprints and iris scan, but in your soul. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5696.04s)]
*  This thing that we can't quite define, but that we know is real. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5701.16s)]
*  Yes. And that's why you have a right. That's why you have rights to anything. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5703.8s)]
*  That's the only reason. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5706.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5707.08s)]
*  That's the only reason you have a right. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5707.5599999999995s)]
*  I remember I was watching, as I mentioned earlier, I was watching you and Brett Weinstein. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5708.6s)]
*  Yesterday, I was watching this. And there was one point where Brett said, and I think he was [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5715.72s)]
*  completely right about this, and you guys kind of agreed, but he said, he goes, you know, the [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5719.96s)]
*  claim that Israel has a right to exist has always seen a little bit strange to me. And he was like, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5724.6s)]
*  I mean, they do exist, but do they have a right to exist? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5729.400000000001s)]
*  Does any country have a right to exist? [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5732.280000000001s)]
*  Well, I think the point is almost this. Countries don't have rights. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5733.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5736.92s)]
*  Individuals have rights. You're using an individualist term and then attempting to apply it to a [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5737.4800000000005s)]
*  collective government. That's not how it works. Every single individual who has Israeli citizenship [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5744.04s)]
*  has a right to exist. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5750.120000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5750.92s)]
*  Every single individual who does not have Israeli citizenship has a right to exist. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5751.4s)]
*  Every Palestinian. This is why people make these arguments. There never was a country [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5755.4s)]
*  called Palestine. Totally irrelevant. Has nothing to do with anything. Doesn't matter [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5758.5199999999995s)]
*  if there was a government or a country. It doesn't matter where the lines on a map are drawn. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5763.96s)]
*  Now, again, I'm not making a lefty argument here. I'm not saying therefore you can't have [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5768.28s)]
*  immigration restrictions. Of course you can. Because a group of people can own a plot of land [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5773.639999999999s)]
*  and they get to decide who can come and who can't come. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5778.12s)]
*  That's right. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5780.5199999999995s)]
*  The point is that if you're trying to apply rights to collectives, you're going to realize [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5781.64s)]
*  that it doesn't make sense. The same way they do this constantly where they apply things like, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5786.68s)]
*  they'll say, does Israel have a right to defend itself? [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5792.36s)]
*  Individuals have a right to defend themselves. By the way, when I defend myself, I don't have [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5795.88s)]
*  the right to aggress upon other innocent people who happen to be in the general vicinity of the [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5801.08s)]
*  person who I want to defend myself against. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5806.76s)]
*  Who have competing rights. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5807.8s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5809.16s)]
*  That are distinct but equal to mine. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5809.8s)]
*  Exactly. That's really all it takes to kind of cure you of a lot of this collectivist nonsense. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5812.360000000001s)]
*  Yes. There is something about the form though. I do think form matters in the same way reading [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5816.76s)]
*  a book on Kindle is a different experience from reading one in print. It just is. Wish it wasn't. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5821.16s)]
*  There's something about the form of social media that disaggregates people from their souls. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5827.08s)]
*  Or at least that's my experience of it. You can just get so pissed off [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5834.84s)]
*  that you forget that every person... You were telling me this at breakfast this morning. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5840.12s)]
*  You're telling me the preamble to Darrell Cooper's World War II series. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5845.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, it's so good. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5849.64s)]
*  Can you just say that? Will you say that? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5850.4400000000005s)]
*  He hasn't put the series out yet. I think he's working on it. I hope it's out soon. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5853.56s)]
*  Darrell, as he talked about on your show, is putting together this big World War II series. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5858.52s)]
*  And when Darrell Cooper does the series... [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5862.28s)]
*  We're having him back this summer. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5863.24s)]
*  I can't wait. I can't wait. Also, just I'm excited for the reaction. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5864.360000000001s)]
*  But I actually think a lot of people are probably going to be disappointed because he's not going [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5868.200000000001s)]
*  to give them... He's not going full Nazi? [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5873.240000000001s)]
*  Well, that's the thing. Of course not. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5876.52s)]
*  It's weirdly the only people... By the way, it's so funny because it's this symbiotic [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5879.64s)]
*  relationship that you see all the time. It's like the only people who want him... [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5884.04s)]
*  It's like the Nazis and the Zionists are the ones who are like, please be a Nazi. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5889.080000000001s)]
*  Please be a Nazi. Please. So that we have this... [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5893.8s)]
*  Everybody else is like, oh great. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5896.6s)]
*  I wonder if they're getting paid from the same source. I suspect some of them are. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5897.88s)]
*  In fact, I don't suspect I know. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5902.04s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of them are. Yeah. And that's part of this new landscape. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5903.64s)]
*  So he does this... He put out the prologue for the series and he had this wonderful [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5909.4s)]
*  part in it. I hope I can kind of do it justice, but it was so beautiful the way he said it. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5915.08s)]
*  But he was talking about when you start to think about the people in Germany in World War II and [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5919.56s)]
*  how there were little three-year-old girls and eight-year-old boys and there were women and [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5927.96s)]
*  there were all... And if you start to humanize them or if you start to dehumanize them, as many [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5933.4800000000005s)]
*  were making the attempt to do, he said you might find yourself having two competing voices in your [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5940.4400000000005s)]
*  head. Like on one level, you go, well, of course there were innocent women and innocent children [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5946.04s)]
*  and of course these are people just like anybody else. And then you might have some other voice [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5951.4s)]
*  that goes, well, they were Germans and it was World War II. So what are you doing trying to humanize [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5955.16s)]
*  anyone? And he goes, okay, that second voice is not you. That's not you. That is a spirit outside [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5960.5199999999995s)]
*  of you acting on you. And just so you know, it's the same spirit that was acting on the Nazis when [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5967.32s)]
*  they were talking about Jews. And that's... Dude, it's so funny for people trying to demonize this [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5972.92s)]
*  guy. This is who he actually is. When he's talking to his audience and he's got a message to give [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5978.04s)]
*  them, this is the message he's giving them. And man, he's just so right about that. And it's the [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5982.52s)]
*  same thing as when you see some hardcore Israel supporter and then some hardcore radical pro-Palestinian [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5987.16s)]
*  and they're going all the Jews, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and then they're going all the Arabs, [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5993.8s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And you're like, you're the same person. Both of you are the same [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=5999.16s)]
*  person. And I'm not trying to completely equate it because obviously the Palestinians have lost [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6003.48s)]
*  in this conflict. They're the ones who have been, you know, truly, you know, they've been [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6007.8s)]
*  fucked over in a way that the Israelis haven't. But any time that you're like dehumanizing an [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6011.88s)]
*  entire group of people, setting the stage to then justify some type of brutal aggression that could [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6017.4s)]
*  not be justified without dehumanizing them first, you are participating in the same exercise that is [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6023.64s)]
*  the reason throughout all of human history that we've had genocides and wars and ethnic [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6033.320000000001s)]
*  cleansing campaigns and just horrible atrocities. Don't do that. Whatever you do, if you ever find [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6038.68s)]
*  yourself doing that, don't do it. We're not allowed to do that. I mean, we play, you play with fire [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6044.92s)]
*  when you do that. And I've stayed silent a lot as I've seen it happen. And I feel shame thinking [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6050.36s)]
*  back on it. When Osama bin Laden's wife was shot, I remember thinking, okay, she got shot and married [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6056.84s)]
*  to Osama bin Laden. That's pretty risky proposition being married to Osama bin Laden and living in [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6063.5599999999995s)]
*  Pakistan. Got it. So I guess, you know, there are risks and she knew what they were. On the other [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6067.4s)]
*  hand, I'm not cheering an unarmed woman getting shot to death under any circumstances. And I don't [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6072.04s)]
*  want anyone in my country doing that either because I love my country and I love the people who live [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6077.08s)]
*  here and they're my countrymen. And I think it's bad to just stay silent. Okay, but don't anybody [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6080.12s)]
*  who encourages you to take pleasure at the death of another person is, you know, acting on behalf [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6087.88s)]
*  of forces that we should be rejecting. Yeah. You know, I said this, I don't care who it is. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6093.8s)]
*  I was on Lex Friedman's podcast pretty recently. He's a good interviewer. He's great. He's great. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6099.0s)]
*  Everyone makes fun of Lex Friedman. I made fun of Lex Friedman probably. I heard other people do it. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6105.24s)]
*  I didn't say anything. Then I was interviewed by Lex Friedman. I was like, this guy's [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6108.92s)]
*  weirdly good at this. Yeah, it's really good. It's easy for people to look at it and think they [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6112.76s)]
*  could do it too. It's a skill to interview somebody and he is excellent. Look what he gets. He gets, [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6117.0s)]
*  did he get good? I haven't seen it. Did he get good stuff? Oh, it was great. And he was, you know, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6122.04s)]
*  he was asking me like, he started really getting into the detail of like what I believe a just [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6126.4400000000005s)]
*  war is and what an immoral war is and why is that. And the example I used, which I think like, I know [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6131.0s)]
*  because I've heard you talk about this stuff too. I think you'll agree with me, but I was like, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6136.5199999999995s)]
*  okay, let's take World War II and let's say that like, not only is the official narrative right, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6140.44s)]
*  let's tweak some things here. It's so much more right than, you know, the Nazis are, if it's [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6146.04s)]
*  possible, they're even worse than the real Nazis were. And if it's possible, they actually were [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6151.0s)]
*  going to take over the world. And actually we would all be speaking German. Like let's say, [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6156.04s)]
*  not only were they going to take over England, they were going to cross the Atlantic and come [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6159.639999999999s)]
*  take over North America also. And the entire world would have fallen into Nazi totalitarianism [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6163.4s)]
*  had they won the war. And let's say in order to stop the Nazis, we had a way where we could do it, [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6170.2s)]
*  where no innocent civilians were killed except one. You know, we could, we could literally just, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6175.639999999999s)]
*  we could take out the Nazis, save the entire world from totalitarianism. By the way, in this model, [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6181.32s)]
*  there's no Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin's a great guy and the Soviets are a free country. There's [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6185.799999999999s)]
*  no moral questions about who we're working with. Just all of it. All we had to do was we could take [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6191.24s)]
*  out the Nazis by dropping this one super bomb, but one six-year-old girl would be killed. Okay. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6196.04s)]
*  So I've made it the most clear cut war in human history. In that scenario, I guess you'd go, look, [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6203.48s)]
*  we have to do this. We have no choice. The whole world will fall to totalitarianism or the whole [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6209.8s)]
*  world can be saved and one six-year-old girl is going to get killed. Okay. I can understand being [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6216.44s)]
*  like, we're making an impossible decision. We have to do this every year on the anniversary of that [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6221.639999999999s)]
*  war. We should all like weep to ourselves. We should all feel horrible that we had to do that [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6226.5199999999995s)]
*  because a six-year-old girl got killed. Like I have a six-year-old girl. This is the most horrible [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6232.12s)]
*  thing in the world that you would ever like kill a six-year-old girl. I mean, my God, I would set the [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6237.639999999999s)]
*  whole world on fire to stop someone from doing anything to my little girl. And like, so if that [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6243.24s)]
*  were in this very clear cut, so not the complexity of real history in this scenario that I'm laying [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6248.04s)]
*  out, we should still all be nothing but pity and sorrow that it ever came to that. And we should [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6253.16s)]
*  rack our brains every day thinking, was there any alternative to that? Was there any way that we [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6258.28s)]
*  could have done that without this little girl getting killed? I'm like, people could say that's [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6262.92s)]
*  kind of like pie in the sky or hippie-ish or whatever, but at the very least, dude, when you're [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6266.28s)]
*  talking about like inflicting this level of human suffering on people, like the onus is always on [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6271.96s)]
*  the people who are advocating for it to absolutely prove beyond the shadow of a doubt that there's no [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6277.96s)]
*  other option, that we've exhausted everything else we could do. It has to be this. And if you come to [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6283.96s)]
*  the conclusion it has to be this, you should still be really sad and somber about it. This spiking the [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6289.16s)]
*  football stuff, having a Bob Hope special after a war, the stuff that America got involved in after [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6295.24s)]
*  the Second World War, it became like kind of like this business of war, this we're spiking the [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6301.4s)]
*  football. It's just like, it's disgusting. And then you're telling me about how some other society is [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6306.839999999999s)]
*  a death cult. Like, let's examine our own. Well, it is disgusting. And I think you don't have to know [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6312.12s)]
*  the right answer going forward to know what the wrong answer is. Right. And it's just, again, [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6319.4s)]
*  you want to treat, you want to approach life and statecraft and bureaucracy and everything in your [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6323.96s)]
*  life with humility. I don't always know the outcome. Yeah. I have limited power. I think I know [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6330.52s)]
*  that murdering a six year old girl will bring world peace. But what if it doesn't? Right. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6337.64s)]
*  Right. Whatever. I think dropping an atomic bomb on the off chance doesn't work out. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6341.56s)]
*  You know, dropping the atom bomb will stop an invasion of Japan. Okay. I think dimming the sun [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6347.96s)]
*  will stop global warming. But maybe I'm wrong. You know, maybe I'm wrong, because I'm a person. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6352.68s)]
*  And it's when people stop remembering the limits to their own wisdom and power that things like [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6357.32s)]
*  that you get genocides and stuff. Well, also, again, like I said before, because this is always [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6363.96s)]
*  just my, it's the way my neurotic brain works or whatever. But I just like can't, like I have this [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6367.639999999999s)]
*  consistency obsession or whatever. But you know, I was listening to your, your show with Matt Walsh [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6373.32s)]
*  the other day and I kind of, I did appreciate some of the things he said about me and the debate with [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6379.639999999999s)]
*  Douglas for a daily wire employee. I think that's about as nice. I felt that as good a reaction as [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6384.52s)]
*  I'm going to get. But he was like, at one point saying that he was like, well, you know, so then [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6389.8s)]
*  the real important, the good point that he said that Douglas Murray made was when he asked me, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6395.0s)]
*  well, then how do you get rid of Hamas? Like what's your plan? So number one, it's not a point, [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6401.8s)]
*  it's a question. But then Matt Walsh was saying like, well, look, I can understand you saying [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6407.88s)]
*  you're against what Israel is doing, but then what should they do to get rid of Hamas? And it's [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6412.84s)]
*  just interesting to me to see any conservative going, wait a minute. So you're against these [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6419.0s)]
*  babies being killed. And it's like, yes, yes, let's call this, I don't know, let me think of a term [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6425.96s)]
*  for it. The pro-life position. Let's call it that. Remember, remember the foundational principle that [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6430.92s)]
*  you've been talking about for your entire career. But wait, hold on. So first of all, before, which [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6437.64s)]
*  by the way, there are lots of other ways to deal with Hamas, obviously. But no, actually, I don't [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6442.44s)]
*  have to solve that problem before I can object to killing innocent children. Right? Like, no, [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6448.36s)]
*  it is not incumbent on the pro-life person to work out a plan for like the adoption. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6455.719999999999s)]
*  Or the college tuition. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6462.44s)]
*  No, actually, no, I'm allowed for my starting point to be you can't murder babies. Right? I mean, [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6463.799999999999s)]
*  come on. And you know, the other thing, which I did want to say is that I do think, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6471.8s)]
*  and look, by the way, as I've said, we're both here kind of coming out against the excesses on [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6477.4800000000005s)]
*  both sides. I'm against racial collectivism. I'm against collective guilt, against collective [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6483.64s)]
*  judgment, even. Yes, collective punishment for sure. But so like, I'm not saying you have to like, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6489.24s)]
*  you shouldn't hate Jews. And you don't even have to hate Israelis. I think you shouldn't hate Israel. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6496.12s)]
*  There's lots of great Israelis. I know some. Yes, there are awesome people. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6501.5599999999995s)]
*  There's lots of really, really great people there. And their government's just done a lot [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6504.44s)]
*  of messed up stuff. But like, so is ours. And so have lots of governments around the world, [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6508.599999999999s)]
*  probably all of them. Probably a direct correlation to how much power they have and [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6511.879999999999s)]
*  how much evil stuff they can do. Exactly. Exactly. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6515.799999999999s)]
*  But, you know, I do think it's a little bit of a cop out for some people who I like very much, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6517.799999999999s)]
*  you know, like I like Matt Walsh. I've never met him. But I think his documentaries are great. I [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6523.48s)]
*  think he's been an important voice in the national conversation, like a very important voice. I like [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6527.56s)]
*  Tim Poole very much. I've done his shows lots of times. I've met him lots of times. I think he's [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6532.6s)]
*  a great guy. But there are these guys who will basically say, like, I'm a non-interventionist. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6536.360000000001s)]
*  I only care about America. I don't care about these other countries. So I don't care. I don't [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6542.92s)]
*  have an opinion on it. And it just seems to me like that's a cop out. It's kind of like in 2006. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6547.160000000001s)]
*  Well, for paying for it. You don't have an opinion on Iraq. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6552.120000000001s)]
*  I don't care about Iraq. I only care about America. It's like, well, we're in Iraq right now. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6554.12s)]
*  Well, I agree with that. That's right. And that's why I felt from the beginning kind of like [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6558.12s)]
*  shanghaied into this. I mean, I don't care on the level that I just want to focus on my own country. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6563.32s)]
*  But if we're deeply involved in it, then I have an obligation to care if it's my job to pay attention [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6568.36s)]
*  to what our country is doing, which it is. So. Right. Well, listen, I have no argument to anybody [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6573.72s)]
*  who goes, I'm just not going to pay attention to politics. My best friend in the world is [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6578.76s)]
*  Luis J Gomez, who came on your show. He's the best. And literally, and this is he is being [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6583.56s)]
*  completely sincere. When you asked him on your show, you go like, so what are your politics? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6588.76s)]
*  And he goes, politics is gay. And that's literally his only answer. And I have in all of my years, [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6592.76s)]
*  I'm literally, I'm his best friend. I don't have a counter to that. I go, that is a pretty good point. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6597.88s)]
*  I married you a woman like that. Yeah. Yeah, me too. You know? And like, so it's like, [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6602.76s)]
*  I have no argument against that. If you, but if you're in this world where we're talking about [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6606.6s)]
*  these things, then you don't get to just say, well, look, taking this opinion, which is the [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6611.4s)]
*  obvious logical conclusion of my stated principles, but if I take them to their conclusion, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6618.679999999999s)]
*  that will cause me grief. Therefore, I'm going to say, I don't really care about that. Because [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6624.12s)]
*  look, here's the thing. If you don't, if you do care about being America first, and you care [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6630.04s)]
*  about America not getting into another stupid catastrophic war in the middle East, well, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6633.879999999999s)]
*  who's pushing us in that direction? And this is not a conspiracy theory. This is like totally out [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6639.24s)]
*  in the open, right? I mean, the longest serving prime minister in Israeli history is John [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6644.44s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. Okay. Right. Benjamin Netanyahu came to the US Congress in 2002 [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6649.88s)]
*  and testified as a regional expert that we should go overthrow Saddam Hussein in Iraq, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6656.76s)]
*  because democracy will sweep the region. He then also said in front of a congressional testimony [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6662.28s)]
*  that we should overthrow Muammar Gaddafi in Libya and that we should overthrow the mullahs in Iran. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6667.24s)]
*  Okay. He's been advocating, he's been John McCain, he's been Dick Cheney this whole time, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6671.639999999999s)]
*  advocating that we fight this next war and this next war and this next war. They're right now, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6676.679999999999s)]
*  what was it, three, four weeks ago, they drew up war plans, including us, to go to war with Iran. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6680.44s)]
*  It's only because Donald Trump, who seems to be willing to help them ethnically cleanse the Gaza [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6687.24s)]
*  Strip, but said, that's a bridge too far for me. I'm not going to war here. And so thank God, [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6691.64s)]
*  now we're in negotiations with the Iranians. But if you know this, then like for you to be a [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6696.84s)]
*  non-interventionist America first, it has to at least come with, and hey, we should cut Israel off [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6702.04s)]
*  and we should not listen to Benjamin Netanyahu. Like, I'm sorry, that's just totally reasonable. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6706.84s)]
*  Or Keir Starmer or any of them. Yes. That's right. So, okay, just take the position, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6711.160000000001s)]
*  which is the obvious one. We should stop funding what Israel's doing. We should stop propping them [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6716.280000000001s)]
*  up. It's been quite a while. The country was created in 1948. It is 2025. You can either go [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6721.16s)]
*  with this alone or you can't. Come on. And those are fair terms, by the way. I mean, [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6727.72s)]
*  those are the terms that the rest of us live our lives on. Yeah. You know, I mean, you make [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6732.599999999999s)]
*  budget decisions in your home on the basis of what you can afford. Yeah. And there's some things you [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6736.76s)]
*  don't do, you know. All of us, mere mortals, have those constrictions on our behavior. Like, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6740.84s)]
*  they're the things I want to do and they're the things that I think I'm capable of doing. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6746.68s)]
*  Yeah. And if I was sitting here and giving like these bravado, you know, infused speeches [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6749.8s)]
*  about all of the things that I can do, but really it relied on me borrowing the money from you [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6757.16s)]
*  in order to do it, you'd be like, hey, maybe stop giving this speech. Maybe Benjamin Netanyahu [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6762.12s)]
*  should stop going to the UN and going, there's nowhere that Israel can't touch. Actually, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6767.0s)]
*  there's lots of places Israel can't touch. Oh, I know. There's nowhere the US can't touch. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6772.2s)]
*  I know. I just think it's getting too out in the open and I do, I mean, I guess I fret too much in [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6775.96s)]
*  general, but I do worry now that it's like super obvious. Yeah. What's going on that things will [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6782.12s)]
*  just devolve into like, some are very ugly. Well, that's why if you have any sense about you [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6788.28s)]
*  and you don't want to see things devolve into something ugly, that's why you want to make sure [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6795.72s)]
*  we don't get into another war right now. I totally agree. It's unbelievable. It's so, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6800.12s)]
*  it's remarkable. I'll tell you this, right? And I'm somebody who has really, you know, been focused [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6806.12s)]
*  on this stuff for a long time. You know, I mean, I host, I do a show four days a week and I'm always [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6813.88s)]
*  reading about this stuff and I've done all the background reading. I mean, I know a lot about [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6819.5599999999995s)]
*  like the neo conservatives and what motivates them, what their worldview was. I will tell you, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6823.08s)]
*  the first thing that really surprised me and I was, I was genuinely, and I hate the neo [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6828.44s)]
*  conservatives. Like I'm not, it's not that I don't understand how evil what they believe is. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6832.36s)]
*  I was really surprised that the Ukraine thing, the Nazis in Ukraine didn't mess with them at all. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6838.36s)]
*  I was shocked. I was really surprised. You know, I know why they support all the wars they have [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6845.719999999999s)]
*  supported. I thought that for the neo conservatives, real deal, not even neo Nazis, Nazis, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6850.04s)]
*  like the grandsons of, you know, the Nazis who perpetrated the Holocaust in Ukraine, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6857.8s)]
*  proudly wearing swastikas, tattoos and waving flags. I mean, like they threw their support behind [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6863.56s)]
*  that as of battalion. This was very strange. Like this was a line to me. I was like, oh wow, [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6870.52s)]
*  they'll really go that far. But I'll tell you, I am blown away by the fact that anybody who is out [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6875.72s)]
*  there shrieking about the rise in antisemitism is not wise enough to go, we cannot fight a war [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6883.64s)]
*  with Iran right now. Because if we get into a war right now, that's clearly on Israel's behalf [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6891.08s)]
*  after 25 years of terror wars, which were pretty clearly at least partially on it. You know, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6897.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm not going to go quite as far as like Jeffrey Sachs, although I get, you know, he's an expert [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6903.240000000001s)]
*  and I'm not, so I guess he's right and I'm not. But you know, I wouldn't quite say that, you know, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6907.320000000001s)]
*  we outsourced our foreign policy to Israel. Like, you know, there's a lot of truth to that [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6912.6s)]
*  statement. Was it Meersheimer or Sachs who said, I view Benjamin Netanyahu as the worst US president [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6917.08s)]
*  of the 21st century. It's pretty hilarious. And there's a lot of truth to that, but it's not like [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6923.0s)]
*  100% sure. It's like, okay, but look, it's obviously, as I just said, Israel has been using [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6929.08s)]
*  its considerable influence to convince us to go to war in Iraq and Libya and Syria and all of these [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6935.48s)]
*  places. I think Yemen was more for the Saudis. Afghanistan was our own thing, but those wars, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6942.839999999999s)]
*  particularly Israel, was really on board with. And if we were to go get into a war with Iran right [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6947.4s)]
*  now, which will be a much bigger disaster than any of the previous terror wars, there's really no [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6952.759999999999s)]
*  argument about that. It's just not a pushover like these other countries. Like at all. Yeah, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6957.32s)]
*  that's right. They can take out a lot of our guys and then what do we do after that? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6963.16s)]
*  Well, they can also destroy Israel with conventional weapons. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6967.32s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot that they can do. But if we actually go to this war on behalf of Israel, [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6969.48s)]
*  I mean, what do you think that does to the level of anti-Semitism? Now, by the way, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6976.68s)]
*  that's not the number one reason not to do it. That's like the number six reason not to do it. [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6980.6s)]
*  But for these people who are so concerned, they're so concerned about the existential [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6984.92s)]
*  threat to Israel. Well, here's the thing, right? Hamas, while they did pull off October 7th, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6988.76s)]
*  which was by far the biggest attack Hamas has ever pulled off, Hamas was never an existential threat [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6993.96s)]
*  to Israel. But this actually is what they're doing right now in some sick, self-fulfilling [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=6999.88s)]
*  prophecy. This actually is creating an existential threat to them. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7007.8s)]
*  I completely agree. If I live there and I think enough of Jerusalem that I would like to live [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7011.72s)]
*  in Jerusalem, I think it's the most incredible city in the world. I truly love it. But I would [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7017.48s)]
*  leave because I think there, and I said this to an Israeli friend of mine recently, I'm a little [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7022.12s)]
*  bit concerned. Not that it's my job to be concerned for your country. Lots of other people have that [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7027.639999999999s)]
*  taken care of, but just as a bystander, it's like, whoa, this is not good. And he had no sense of [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7031.24s)]
*  what I was talking about. But yeah, no, I think the one area where I agree with Mark Levin [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7039.24s)]
*  is that Israel is really in danger. And I think it's people like Mark Levin who are putting [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7046.04s)]
*  Israel in danger, in my view. Maybe I'm wrong. No, I think that's right. I think just like I [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7050.6s)]
*  was saying, Douglas Murray, it's actually like, no, you're creating fertile ground for anti-Semitism [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7055.8s)]
*  by telling me I'm not allowed to criticize a guy with a Jewish last name. In the same sense, [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7060.2s)]
*  this is- Saying that you claim some Jewish ancestor. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7064.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, come on. But that's so low. It's so low to debate like that. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7066.36s)]
*  You're the famous debater? Yeah. And in an op-ed, after you lose a debate, [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7071.88s)]
*  not even lose, after you refuse to debate and kind of beclown yourself, and then you're writing an [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7077.639999999999s)]
*  op-ed and you don't take on one argument I made, but you do attack whether I'm really Jewish. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7082.84s)]
*  By the way, as he'll criticize the just asking questions people. Well, what the hell is that? [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7088.759999999999s)]
*  That's me, by the way. That's who they're talking about. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7094.599999999999s)]
*  Right. I know. I know. It's all so pathetic. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7096.5199999999995s)]
*  It's so funny. The first time I heard that, I was like, wait, are you actually mad that I [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7098.28s)]
*  asked a question? Isn't anyone who's trying to shut down questions, isn't that person by definition [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7102.759999999999s)]
*  on the wrong side? Yeah. Well, you know, it's funny- [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7107.8s)]
*  Like what world are we living in? I lived too long. I should have died 10 years ago. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7110.84s)]
*  Well, you know what's so funny about it too is that there's, because there's all these different [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7116.2s)]
*  techniques for control. And one of them is just framing. Like how you frame a conversation really, [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7119.96s)]
*  with the Israel thing, it's obvious, right? Look, I mean, however you feel about the conflict, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7127.96s)]
*  the fact is that Israel has occupied Palestine since 1967. Okay, I know that they're, [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7132.68s)]
*  no, we disengaged in 2005. No, you didn't. But whatever, I'm not even like, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7137.72s)]
*  I've had this debate enough times. I'm just saying this is the fact, is that Israel's occupied [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7141.64s)]
*  Palestine since 1967. That's the fact. And then the conversation, they go, does Israel have a right [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7144.76s)]
*  to defend itself? And you're like, well, that's a hell of a way to start. You're the ones doing [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7149.56s)]
*  the occupying and you want to start every debate with whether you have a right to defend yourself. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7154.12s)]
*  Okay. But with all these things, there's kind of, you know, like this is what was interesting to me [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7158.84s)]
*  about the conversation with you and Brett Weinstein about the, you know, about God versus atheism and [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7163.0s)]
*  all this stuff. Is that like, so people, it's very easy to have the framing of going like, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7168.36s)]
*  oh, as you're telling me, you believe there's an invisible man up in the sky who created all things. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7174.28s)]
*  That's pretty goofy, right? It's like, yeah, if you just frame it like that, sure, it's pretty [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7179.08s)]
*  goofy. I'm sorry. What's your belief? You believe everything used to fit on the top of a pin and [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7183.32s)]
*  then it exploded into everything. Everything came from nothing and then exploded into, [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7188.04s)]
*  this is just as ridiculous as anything anyone's ever believed. So like, as soon as you look at [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7193.08s)]
*  both sides and apply the same standard to both, and you know, there's been one thing that's a very [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7197.0s)]
*  interesting dynamic to me. I've seen this a lot when people will try to attack you where what they'll [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7201.4s)]
*  do is they'll pull like kind of the five things you've said that seem like almost the goofiest [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7206.28s)]
*  of all the things. Well, he said this thing about like a demon attacking him. Okay. He said this [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7214.12s)]
*  thing about, you know, like, right, right. Sorry, I didn't want to. No, but look, but look even yes, [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7217.96s)]
*  in itself, but like, okay, that sounds like an outlandish claim. Like I'm not, but then it's [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7224.04s)]
*  almost like they're trying to ignore the totality. I see this a lot with Bobby Kennedy. This has been [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7229.32s)]
*  one of the most interesting things about Bobby is that the people who attack him, they pick on [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7234.04s)]
*  the five, you know, goofiest things they can find that they think he said, you know, he blamed the [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7239.32s)]
*  wifi for this, or he said something about whatever the COVID targeting certain genetics and not other [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7244.6s)]
*  genetics. And it's like, look, even if I grant you, there are these five claims, which I don't know [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7251.08s)]
*  if I, you know, Bobby said some things that I'm like, I don't know if he's right about that or [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7256.04s)]
*  not. It seems kind of, but this, but they're trying to remove the central thing that he said. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7259.56s)]
*  Of course. And the central, this is Trump in a nutshell too, right? The central thing that Bobby [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7264.360000000001s)]
*  Kennedy said is that we spend more money than any other country on healthcare and we're the sickest. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7268.92s)]
*  Exactly. Now until you can take on that, you're never going to win by just trying to knock out [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7273.8s)]
*  these other good, cause at least he's talking about the major thing. And by the way, not only [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7279.080000000001s)]
*  did he say that, none of you have ever mentioned that. Never. I've watched every presidential [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7282.68s)]
*  campaign. It's never once come up. Well, and in fact, everything they do mention is a way to [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7287.08s)]
*  avoid mentioning it. Exactly. But we had a whole, we had a whole debate in this country about health [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7291.5599999999995s)]
*  insurance and this never came up. We had the Obamacare debate and like, and no one even ever [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7296.28s)]
*  mentioned. I didn't know it until Bobby came on my show. Yeah, me neither. Back when he was banned. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7301.8s)]
*  Yeah, no. But I have to say the thing that I have learned really above all other things is the only [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7307.08s)]
*  way to assess a claim is on the basis of whether or not it's true. Right. Not on whether or not I [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7314.28s)]
*  want to hear it on whether or not I've thought of it before, whether or not I'm shocked by the fact [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7319.0s)]
*  that you asked the question. The only thing that matters is, is it true? Now, can I know most of [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7323.5599999999995s)]
*  the time? No, I can't know, but I want my orientation, the way I approach each question to be the same [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7328.84s)]
*  every single time, which is, is that true? And the second I stopped caring about whether it's true, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7334.92s)]
*  then I'm acting on behalf of evil. Right. It's that simple. Right. Right? Yeah. No, I completely [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7340.04s)]
*  agree. So when Bobby Kennedy's like, oh, COVID's targeted on the basis of genes, I was like, [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7345.24s)]
*  really? Is that true? Yeah. Well, I kind of felt, I felt the same way. And I think particularly what, [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7349.24s)]
*  I think it's very similar to talking about the 9-11 truth or stuff with Jesse Ventura. It's like, [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7355.8s)]
*  what ends up happening is that after you're kind of red-pilled about so much, the claims don't seem [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7360.76s)]
*  quite as outlandish. That's not saying that they're right. You know, like, and I've, you know, with [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7367.56s)]
*  the 9-11 conspiracy stuff, I've never been like completely sold. I think there are a lot of people [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7372.92s)]
*  who jump to conclusions that are, and like, actually the evidence isn't nearly as strong [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7378.68s)]
*  as you think it is. You're kind of, you're doing what everyone does, where you start with a [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7383.320000000001s)]
*  conclusion and then you work your way backward from there. And there's a lot of that. But at the same [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7386.52s)]
*  time, it's like the people who go, well, our government would never, you're like, now that [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7391.72s)]
*  doesn't work anymore, dude. Sorry. So yeah, they totally would. They actually totally would. I'm [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7395.72s)]
*  not even saying they did in this case, but they totally were. Or it's so painful to re-examine [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7400.6s)]
*  the worldview I've built on what would be a fake assumption that I'm not going to do it. I'm going [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7404.76s)]
*  to yell at you instead for challenging that worldview. Like that doesn't work either because [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7409.320000000001s)]
*  it's already happened. You can only lose your virginity once. Right. Right. And once you realize [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7413.08s)]
*  that the Warren commission really was a cover-up, I mean, it just was. And on the base of evidence, [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7418.04s)]
*  I've concluded that then it's like, okay, if the U S government will hide details about the murder [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7422.92s)]
*  of a democratically elected U S president, then there's really nothing that they wouldn't do. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7429.4800000000005s)]
*  And then the Nixon one is a big one, two punch, because you realize that like, oh, the guy who [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7434.52s)]
*  became the villain, like the guy who was like supposed to be remembered as the most corrupt [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7439.64s)]
*  president was actually the most popular president who was totally set up. And you're like, okay, [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7445.96s)]
*  we're just not living in the country that. So I came to that independently having known a lot [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7452.84s)]
*  of those people. I know Bob Woodward personally, and I lived in that world for my whole life. And [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7457.72s)]
*  Nixon had the highest popular vote percentage of any president in American history. I didn't in 72. [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7465.320000000001s)]
*  I just didn't even know that. And when I found that Bob Woodward was a naval intelligence officer [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7471.96s)]
*  detailed to the Nixon White House, then the next year gets the biggest story in journalism history [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7477.0s)]
*  handed to him. And how old was he? 328 something like that. That happens a lot. That's totally, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7481.64s)]
*  that's totally normal. And deep throw was the deputy director of the FBI and the guy they [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7487.72s)]
*  installed as president was on the Warren commission. Yeah. Yeah. I never liked Gerald Ford because of [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7492.68s)]
*  the withdrawal from Saigon on April 30th, 1975. I just thought that was like everything about that [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7498.92s)]
*  was so ugly, but whatever. Yes, I agree. So it's not enough to say I'm not allowed to think [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7505.08s)]
*  something. Right. Or that or once you, but once you recognize those things, it's just impossible. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7511.0s)]
*  It's impossible to reconstruct the image of America that you once had. You're like, oh, [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7519.08s)]
*  that's not at all what this government is. And that doesn't make you an anti-American bigot. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7524.04s)]
*  No. Any more than saying like criticizing a government does not make you a bad person. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7527.48s)]
*  No, this is, it's, it's, this is, what's it, it's Frederick Bostiat stuff. Like this was already [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7532.68s)]
*  figured out a long time ago. Society and the government are not interchangeable things. They [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7539.16s)]
*  are different. You know, criticizing Joe Biden is not criticizing America. I'm not criticizing [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7544.44s)]
*  the Hills and the lakes. I'm criticizing this one senile criminal. Or my neighbors or my relatives. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7549.96s)]
*  Right. People I love. There's so many of them. So last, last question, you made reference to [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7555.96s)]
*  the Brett Weinstein conversation we had last week about creationism versus Darwinism, et cetera, [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7561.48s)]
*  et cetera, the existence of God. Do you find in your life, this is a quiz I give a lot of people, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7567.16s)]
*  more people you know, personally talking about God than you did say 10 years ago? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7572.2s)]
*  Yes. And I am that person. I mean, I was an atheist 10 years ago. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7577.8s)]
*  What happened? [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7581.96s)]
*  I had my daughter. That's, you know, as I found God the day my wife delivered our first child, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7582.68s)]
*  and which is a fairly common experience. I know other people who have had the same thing were [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7590.2s)]
*  atheists until that moment. And what changed in you? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7595.8s)]
*  So, all right. So it was a basically, so I met my, so, you know, it's a fairly normal story, [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7600.6s)]
*  but I met my wife and we got engaged and then we got married. So my wife's like the most amazing [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7607.56s)]
*  chick. She's just great. And I know this is, it's always a thing to say. It's like, [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7614.84s)]
*  my wife's better than your wife type thing, but everybody who knows my wife, I don't mean you, [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7618.4400000000005s)]
*  I've never met your wife, but she is better. And just kidding. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7622.92s)]
*  No, I don't hear people compliment their spouses enough, actually. I don't think everyone always [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7627.0s)]
*  says that. I wish people said that more often. Yeah, maybe you're right. Well, I do, you know, [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7631.64s)]
*  it's not, she's really just the best. Everyone who knows her would agree. I mean, like, it's just [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7635.16s)]
*  like, she's like the most amazing woman. She's just gorgeous and she's really super smart and [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7639.24s)]
*  she's really sweet and kind. And she's just like, she puts everyone above herself. She's like, [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7643.8s)]
*  I really hit the lottery with her and I was never, you know, I was like habitually single. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7650.76s)]
*  I was never a relationship guy and I never really wanted to get married. I kind of always had this [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7656.52s)]
*  view of like, you know, women are trying to change you or trying to control you. Every girl that I [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7661.320000000001s)]
*  ever dated always wanted a relationship and then they always wanted me to not do this or not do [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7666.360000000001s)]
*  that. And my wife was just, she just had my back. She just always like wanted to make my life better [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7670.76s)]
*  and she did. And I just, I fell in love with her and I was like, I'm gonna spend the rest of my [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7677.4s)]
*  life with this woman. And so then we, when she got pregnant, I was just very excited. It was like, [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7682.2s)]
*  you know, you just got married, got a baby on the way. I was just like, this is going to be, [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7688.28s)]
*  this is the best. Like, I'm really excited to do this. And I was right. It was the best thing I've [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7693.16s)]
*  ever done. And so the day that was, well, she was over her due date. So then they scheduled to come [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7698.36s)]
*  in to induce pregnancy because they don't let you go too long these days, which I guess is there, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7707.24s)]
*  maybe they're right about that. I don't know. But anyway, so we go to the hospital. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7712.04s)]
*  They get the pitocin out. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7714.599999999999s)]
*  Yes, that's right. So we're at Lenox Hill Hospital in the upper East side of Manhattan. And [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7715.96s)]
*  by the way, I should add, just leading into the story, over the, I had been like a militant atheist [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7723.16s)]
*  when I was younger, I had started to open up my mind a little bit to being like, I was seeing [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7727.72s)]
*  some of the holes in the atheist arguments, but I still was not like a believer in God. And so we [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7732.12s)]
*  were at Lenox Hill Hospital and this is that there was the first one. This is how it started was the [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7737.72s)]
*  anesthesiologist came in to give my wife an epidural. And at Lenox Hill, or at least this guy, [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7744.4400000000005s)]
*  they asked me to leave the room. They said they ask the fathers to leave the room when they do it, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7751.0s)]
*  because they're putting a spinal thing in and they have to be very, very precise. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7756.28s)]
*  It's horrifying to see it. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7760.28s)]
*  Yeah. Right. And they don't want, I guess they don't want you there to react because then she [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7761.5599999999995s)]
*  might react. And so they don't want to, so I go out. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7765.4s)]
*  And she can't see what's happening. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7767.8s)]
*  Right. Right. She can't see, but she could see you seeing. And so they want people with a straight [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7769.0s)]
*  poker face who have seen this a lot of times and are not watching it happen to their wife and baby. [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7772.92s)]
*  So it's a reasonable ask. But so I go out and I'm in the hallway in the maternity ward at Lenox [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7777.24s)]
*  Hill hospital and I'm just, and it just hit me. It was like for the first time, I guess I had not [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7784.04s)]
*  really thought about this. I was just so excited to get my family started, but for the first time [[02:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7789.48s)]
*  it hit me that like something could go wrong and that I could leave here alone. You know, [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7793.96s)]
*  like something could go wrong that I could lose the baby. I could lose my wife and it's totally [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7800.6s)]
*  out of my control. And like, as this started hitting me, I started like really getting emotional. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7804.28s)]
*  And it's like, I'm out there and I'm like, I'm crying in the hallway of this maternity ward. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7809.16s)]
*  And immediately I just started talking to God. And I just started not just talking to God, [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7814.599999999999s)]
*  but like negotiating with God. And I was just like, you know, like, like, dear Lord, if you, [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7821.08s)]
*  if you make sure that they're okay, I'm going to do like, I'm going to be the best husband [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7826.76s)]
*  and the best father and I will do this and you know, like all the different things in your life. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7832.12s)]
*  Had you ever prayed before? [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7835.48s)]
*  No, never once in my life. And it all, you know, like all the things that you know, [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7836.44s)]
*  you're supposed to be doing that you're not doing that well, you know, like I was like, [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7840.599999999999s)]
*  okay, I'll clean this up. You know, I'll call my mom more often. I'll do this thing. I'll do. [[02:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7843.4s)]
*  And so anyway, so I just started like praying to God and not just praying, but like negotiating. [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7847.719999999999s)]
*  So anyway, everything was fine with that. But my wife, this was the first of many times she had a [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7852.12s)]
*  very, there were a bunch of complications in the pregnancy. Everyone came out. Okay. Thank God. But [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7856.839999999999s)]
*  so I ended up talking to God a lot that day. And then just like, as the days went on, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7862.28s)]
*  it's so interesting. It's organic lifetime of not believing. And then, [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7868.2s)]
*  yeah, just start praying. And so this is almost like what intellectually, [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7872.36s)]
*  you know, converted me later was I was like, Hey, what the hell was that? I mean, I could, [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7875.88s)]
*  I can't look back and just ignore that. And, and there was one, you know, like, again, I'm almost [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7881.24s)]
*  a little uncomfortable talking about these things, because I like talking about things where I have [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7887.24s)]
*  like a real tight argument that I can prove is irrefutable. But it was something where I was like, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7889.96s)]
*  look, so in the moment when it was really all on the line and out of my control, I wasn't thinking, [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7896.28s)]
*  maybe God exists. I knew for a 100% certainty, unlike nothing I've ever known in my life, [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7902.12s)]
*  that not only did I know that God existed, but I knew what he wanted from me. Like I knew what my [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7908.44s)]
*  negotiating power in this was, is that I could, you know what I'm saying? Like I could promise [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7913.96s)]
*  I'll be a good person. I'll do. So not only did I know God existed, I knew that God wanted me to [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7919.0s)]
*  be a good person. And there was, and look, this is something that people who have found God know, [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7923.96s)]
*  and people who don't believe in God maybe will not accept. But there is something too, [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7929.32s)]
*  when you open yourself up like that to God, like you find out that he's real. And it's not like he [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7935.16s)]
*  speaks to you or he hallucinates. I don't like see a fiery bush and the words of God started talking, [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7944.28s)]
*  but like he fills you. Like when you open yourself like that to it, you get filled by it. And there's [[02:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7949.0s)]
*  no more debate in your mind over whether that's a real phenomenon or not. You're like, and any more [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7955.719999999999s)]
*  than like if I were to leave here and someone were to be like, do you believe in Tucker Carlson? [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7960.759999999999s)]
*  And like, I'd be like, no, I know for certain, like I know for a certainty that Tucker Carlson [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7965.08s)]
*  exists. I was just with him. It's like that. And so it was, and it's never, it changed my life. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7969.96s)]
*  And ever since I regularly pray to God, it's something I'm conscious of every single day. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7975.48s)]
*  No way. Every day, every day. And always, I don't even pray exactly. I don't ask for things, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7980.44s)]
*  ever. I ask for one thing ever from God, which is that my wife and my kids are healthy and safe. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7986.84s)]
*  It's the only thing I ever pray for. I don't ask for anything. The only other thing that I do is I [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7993.48s)]
*  I express gratitude. I just say thank you for everything I have. So that's the extent of it. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=7997.32s)]
*  But I think that I cannot overstate how much I think that's made me a better person. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8005.5599999999995s)]
*  Really? Yeah. It's very, very good for you to constantly remind yourself how lucky you are [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8010.04s)]
*  that you have all the things that you have. It's very easy to get away from that. And that's where [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8015.48s)]
*  you ruin your inner happiness, your inner joy, is if you start taking the things you have for [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8022.12s)]
*  granted. Because once you, like, you know, once you, when you think you could lose everything you [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8027.24s)]
*  already have and then you don't, that's when you really appreciate it. You know, you really [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8033.0s)]
*  appreciate what, how lucky we all are. Well, not to be like too blunt or too personal, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8037.56s)]
*  but you're on the cusp of like change in your life on the basis of what's happened in the last [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8042.360000000001s)]
*  month in your life. I've just seen this story so many times. So to be vulgar, your income in this [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8046.92s)]
*  year will be higher than last year. I was telling you that because you're way more famous and you're [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8052.52s)]
*  also on the right side of history, I think. Yeah, I hope so. And certainly on the right side of [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8058.12s)]
*  popular opinion. So like that, do you think, I mean, the danger in life is getting what you want [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8064.4400000000005s)]
*  and finding yourself unhappier? Are you worried about that? No, I'm really not. And I do just [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8072.52s)]
*  think that it's because, again, if this was happening to me at 25 or at 30, I would be very [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8079.240000000001s)]
*  concerned about that danger. Literally, like what I just told you is kind of already happened in my [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8084.84s)]
*  life. I know who I am as a person. I kind of know what money actually means. Like there's lots of [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8089.8s)]
*  nice things. I'm not downplaying money. It's very important, particularly in my position. It's very [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8094.280000000001s)]
*  important for me to be able to protect my wife and kids that we have some money, you know what [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8098.84s)]
*  I mean? So that I can do that. But no, I'm really not worried about that at this point. I think I've [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8103.4800000000005s)]
*  kind of like, my wife herself is a very grounding force for me. She's the person whose approval I [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8109.400000000001s)]
*  seek. She's the person whose opinion I really care about. And she keeps me very grounded. Also, [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8114.6s)]
*  just as you know, having these little kids just keeps you grounded because they just don't care [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8121.08s)]
*  at all. Like literally at all. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8127.4s)]
*  And my six-year-old, the other day we were out to dinner. And so we're out to dinner. We're sitting [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8129.08s)]
*  down. My wife, my six-year-old girl and my three-year-old boy and the owner of the restaurant [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8133.32s)]
*  is like a fan of mine. So he comes over to the table. He goes, oh, thank you guys so much for [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8138.44s)]
*  coming. I just wanted to shake your hand. I really appreciate everything you're doing. And I was like, [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8141.799999999999s)]
*  oh, thank you so much. I appreciate that. So he leaves. And then my daughter, my six-year-old, [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8144.92s)]
*  who's kind of 17, but she's six, she turns over at me and she goes, why did he come over and say hi [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8149.08s)]
*  to you, dad, because you're famous. And then just turned right back to her menu. I mean, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8153.96s)]
*  she could not have just undercut me more than that. I was like, oh, yeah, I guess I'm not really that [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8158.92s)]
*  cool. All right. But that stuff helps. It's the best. I'm really lucky that I didn't have this [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8163.32s)]
*  moment 15 years ago that I had it now. So I think I'll be good. But then you cut back to me in a year. [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8171.56s)]
*  I come back here. I got like the shades on or something. It's totally ruined me. [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8178.92s)]
*  Dave, it's wonderful to see you. No matter how many times you've been here, I hope you'll return. [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8187.16s)]
*  I hope to be in again. And can I just say, by the way, just the last thing I'll say and then [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8192.12s)]
*  we could end, but I will say that, you know, a big part of like the reason why I'm able to do what I [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8197.88s)]
*  do and be kind of protected because I'm not like I'm not vulnerable. At least I don't think, [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8203.08s)]
*  I hope I don't live to eat these words, but I don't think I'm going to be ruined or canceled [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8209.0s)]
*  or anything like that. And a big part of it is that Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson have my back. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8213.08s)]
*  And you kind of can't really cancel someone in today's world as long as those guys have your [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8219.72s)]
*  back. And so nobody I'm saying you're providing a lot of cover for people to be able to tell the [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8224.039999999999s)]
*  truth and know that like, oh, you're not going to be able to like shut this person out of the [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8228.76s)]
*  conversation for the crime of telling the truth. Well, the money thing is important to that extent. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8233.56s)]
*  Money does not make you happy, but being dependent on other people's money can make you [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8238.04s)]
*  enslaved and not having debt, not having investors. We don't have debt or investors. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8242.52s)]
*  That makes a huge difference in my life. And I, but you also have like actual skills. You can [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8249.56s)]
*  just go do shows for the rest of your life. Do you know what I mean? And I'm quite happy to do that. [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8256.04s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. So actually you were talking about Matt Walsh, who I really do like. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8260.52s)]
*  And I thought for, you know, to the extent that, you know, he said what he said, kind of impressive [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8264.68s)]
*  considering he works at the Daily Wire. He still works at the Daily Wire, however. And I know I'm [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8270.04s)]
*  not mocking him at all. I worked at Fox News for, you know, 15 years and you do have like in the [[02:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8273.320000000002s)]
*  back of your mind, like, of course, can I say that? Or, you know, you self censor even when you're not [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8278.76s)]
*  aware that you do, but if you're, if you're truly independent, then you can be independent. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8285.48s)]
*  Yeah. Which is the best. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8289.24s)]
*  The best. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8291.8s)]
*  It's really just so great. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8292.84s)]
*  Well, I think you're funny, even if Douglas does. Dave, thank you. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8294.359999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8298.279999999999s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising. That's [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8303.24s)]
*  what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8308.279999999999s)]
*  now. All the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8312.36s)]
*  fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. And that [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8317.640000000001s)]
*  is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8323.800000000001s)]
*  waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8330.04s)]
*  actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. The way to do that [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8334.36s)]
*  on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8339.48s)]
*  to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have a much higher chance [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8344.199999999999s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=claOs_1LjXM&t=8349.48s)]
