# Steve Witkoff’s Critical Role in Negotiating Global Peace, and the Warmongers Trying to Stop Him
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo)
*  Steve, thank you so much for coming. So I think you've had one of the most, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=0.0s)]
*  maybe the most remarkable life trajectories of anyone I've ever met. And you wind up close to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4.24s)]
*  Trump, you campaigned with Trump, you're an intimate friend of the presidents, and you could [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  have had any job you don't want, any job, because you're doing your own thing. And then he taps you [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=16.32s)]
*  as a diplomat, as a negotiator on behalf of him. And you wind up becoming, you know, probably the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=21.52s)]
*  most effective negotiator in my lifetime. And you have, you know, you speak for the president, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=28.8s)]
*  I think everyone acknowledges that. You're honest, and people like you personally. So those are, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=33.92s)]
*  obviously, the foundations of effective diplomacy. But what have you learned about negotiating [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=39.44s)]
*  at, you know, on behalf of a country in the last couple months? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=47.92s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think President Trump sets the table. Yes. For all of us. He really does. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=58.8s)]
*  This whole peace through strength thing, it's not just a slogan. It actually works. And so when he [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=79.28s)]
*  dispatches you to go to the Middle East, people are almost a little bit intimidated before you get [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=86.0s)]
*  there. And this goes for me and, you know, other people who are doing a similar job. So he sets the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=93.84s)]
*  table in a pretty powerful way. But negotiating is being outcome oriented. I talk about this a lot. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=99.52s)]
*  It's figuring out where you want to get to. That's Trump's game plan all the time. I sit with the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=106.48s)]
*  president and we talk often about what the end game is, where does he want to get to. And once [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=111.84s)]
*  you decide where you want to get to, then it's all about tactically figuring out what that pathway is. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  With the Middle Eastern, you know, Tucker, when I first got in, and I was talking to Brett McGurk, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=124.4s)]
*  who was the envoy on behalf of Biden, he was a smart guy. Yes. He just didn't have a great [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=131.84s)]
*  boss giving him direction. So he couldn't really speak on behalf of Biden. I was able to speak on [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=137.76s)]
*  behalf of Trump because we talked about it. We had a great conversation about it. He said to me, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=144.39999999999998s)]
*  this is where I want to get to, Steve. And so when I went in there, I went in with the imprimatur of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=150.0s)]
*  the president and it became a, you know, that's the difference maker. But I mean, clearly, and no one [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=154.56s)]
*  doubts that you speak for the president, that you know what the president wants because you know the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  president, you actually talk to him. You're not some guy he just hired. And that makes a huge [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=166.96s)]
*  difference. But it also seems like you think through whoever you're negotiating with is coming [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  from. Like, what do they want? Well, there's no doubt. I'm always trying to put myself in the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=178.0s)]
*  shoes of the other person because a good deal has to work for everybody. But I want to just say this, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=182.96s)]
*  when I say I speak for the president, it's not because I presume what he's thinking. Yes. It's [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=189.36s)]
*  because I ask what he's thinking. He is the president. I'm in my job only because of him. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=195.52s)]
*  And to me, I give him the respect of always asking the question, where do you want to get to, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=201.04000000000002s)]
*  Mr. President? And so that's critical. So now I know where he stands. And now it's about [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=207.44s)]
*  tactics. As you talk about from the other side's standpoint, it's important for me to know or to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=214.0s)]
*  have a feeling of where the Israelis want to get to. What about the Qataris? They're the mediators [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=220.64s)]
*  at the table. What do they want to accomplish here? What about Hamas? Where are they? Will they really [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=225.6s)]
*  demilitarize? Is that something they'll do? Will they take the Golden Bridge out of Gaza? All of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=231.27999999999997s)]
*  these are considerations. But first, they have to find out where the boss wants to end up. And the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  boss is President Trump. It almost feels forbidden for you to say what you just said. So what does [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=243.28s)]
*  Israel want? Obviously a critical Vicky question. But there are other players. And what do they want? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=251.12s)]
*  And I don't know that I've heard anybody say that out loud, ever. Any American say that out loud. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=258.0s)]
*  And I think you've been criticized for saying that out loud. Well, I think it's important to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=264.48s)]
*  recognize that everybody may want something. I think in the case of the Qataris, they're criticized [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=268.4s)]
*  for not being well motivated. It's preposterous. They are well motivated. They're good, decent [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=275.28s)]
*  people. What they want is a mediation that's effective, that gets to a peace goal. And why? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=281.12s)]
*  Because they're a small nation and they want to be acknowledged as a peacemaker. And I think the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  president realizes that. And I realize that today. But we have to know that if they had a different [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  agenda, it would be important for us to know that different agenda. I think if they had a different [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=296.72s)]
*  agenda, it would be fine. As long as we weren't operating blind. And operating blind is really [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=301.12s)]
*  the problem in a negotiation like this. You have to know where everybody stands. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=306.40000000000003s)]
*  Just laughing because what you're saying is so obviously true. It's a prerequisite to getting a [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=311.92s)]
*  deal. And yet it is so different from the posture that the last couple of generations of diplomats [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=316.56s)]
*  have taken, which is like, here's what we want, shut up and do it. And I just don't think leaving [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=325.92s)]
*  aside like moral considerations, I don't think that's been very effective. Well, you know, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=332.0s)]
*  here's an example, Gaza, and what the president set forth is what he wanted to do with Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=336.16s)]
*  I came back from my first trip. This is before he was inaugurated, where we had permission [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=342.48s)]
*  from the Biden administration to collaborate with them. Yes. And the president said, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  when do you think Gaza can be reconstructed? 15 years was my answer, maybe 20. And he said, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=352.72s)]
*  why? I said, I gave them the battlefield conditions. I was in Gaza, actually, that it's [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  been decimated. It's been destroyed. There are tunnels underneath. So think Swiss cheese [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=364.8s)]
*  underneath, and then they got hit with bunker buster bombs. So there's no rock there anymore. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=369.36s)]
*  There's no place to put footings if you're going to build buildings. And yet the whole world thought [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  that this was a five year reconstruction plan. And why? Because the Biden May 27 protocol, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=380.72s)]
*  which is the operating agreement pursuant to which the negotiation between Hamas [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=386.64000000000004s)]
*  and the US government and Israel happen, talks about a five year plan. But it's those are that's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=391.44000000000005s)]
*  a false set of facts. Level setting the facts, you have to acknowledge that it's a 15 to 20 year plan. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=398.0s)]
*  When we first started talking 15 to 20 years, everyone said that, that we didn't know what we [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  were talking about until the journal wrote an article and said 15 to 20 years. Yes. So [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=410.16s)]
*  the president's plan about Gaza was all about how do we put people back in a battle zone? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=415.84000000000003s)]
*  Were there ammunition all over the field? Or were there are these latent conditions so that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=425.04s)]
*  a kid could fall into a hole and go 40, 50, 60 feet down, and you'd never know that he was there? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=430.88s)]
*  Who would do such a thing? If we had buildings in those conditions in New York, there would be [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=437.44s)]
*  yellow tape all around and no one would be allowed in. And then of course he got criticized for that [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=442.15999999999997s)]
*  as if he was looking to create a beachside community with gleaming towers and casinos. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=447.91999999999996s)]
*  It was preposterous. He was being realistic about how you needed to consider Gaza. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=454.24s)]
*  So I think it's really important that when you're making these decisions that you level set the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=460.88s)]
*  facts. And that was my instructions from President Trump. Go out there, level set the facts, figure [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=465.76s)]
*  out what it is, and then we'll make decisions about where we want to see Gaza going to. And [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=470.4s)]
*  I think that's a better program. It's definitely a better program. I mean, operating on the basis of [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=475.44s)]
*  honesty works. So okay, I think the president's goal is pretty clear. He said it many times. He [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=481.28s)]
*  campaigned on it. He was elected on it, which is we want stability and peace in the world. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=490.24s)]
*  It's not good for anybody when we don't have that. But to the extent that you understand it, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=495.12s)]
*  and since you're one of the few people who seems willing to say it out loud, can you just describe [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=500.72s)]
*  the three players in the current conflict in the Middle East, the big ones, can you go through and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=504.16s)]
*  tell us what you think each one wants? What's their goal? So Israel, Hamas, and Qatar. So I think [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=510.72s)]
*  Qatar is a small nation, probably has the highest GDP per capita, per person, right, of anyone in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=520.48s)]
*  the world. Huge, huge reserves. I think they want stability. I think they want a peace treaty from [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=528.4s)]
*  the United States. Why? Because, and all the Middle East, all the GCC countries want that, by the way. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=534.16s)]
*  This is an interesting point. Everybody thinks the peace treaty is about physical defense. What it's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=539.9200000000001s)]
*  really about is the United States providing a security wrapper so that they're all financeable. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=544.96s)]
*  Today, you can't borrow money in those countries. So if you want to go do a deal in Saudi Arabia, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  in the UAE, JP Morgan, if they are the hypothetical bank, has to underwrite war risk. They have to [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=556.72s)]
*  underwrite, will the hoodies in Saudi Arabia fire in a hypersonic missile and destroy that AI data [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=563.6s)]
*  center that you just bought for $200 billion? That's a real problem. So a lot of these countries [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=570.0s)]
*  want defense treaties so that they're not just building out of their pocket. They're taking their [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=574.96s)]
*  oil money and they're actually leveraging it and creating a better economy long term. So I think [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=579.44s)]
*  the Qataris want stability and they don't get enough credit for that motivation. It's a good [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=585.76s)]
*  motivation for their people. Amen. So, but they're often accused, why almost universally accused in [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=591.04s)]
*  the US media of being agents of Iran. Yeah, it's preposterous. Look, they're a Muslim nation. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=597.68s)]
*  In the past, they've had some views that are a little bit more radical from an Islamist standpoint [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=605.52s)]
*  than they are today, but it's moderated quite a bit. There's no doubt that they're an ally of [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  the United States. There's no doubt about that. Maybe a huge air base there. By the way, and they [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=619.76s)]
*  pay for every dollar of it. They don't have their hand out for a thing. There is nothing that the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=624.96s)]
*  United States has to fund with regard to that air base. That's pretty unusual. It's amazing. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=630.0s)]
*  Right? So they fund everything. They don't ask for much. I think I had a conversation with General [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  Carrillo, Eric Carrillo, who runs CENCOM, an amazing man. And I said to him, what do you think [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=640.64s)]
*  of the Qataris? He says they're special people. So the people in the know know that they're good, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=645.12s)]
*  decent people. What does Hamas want? I think they want to stay there until the end of time, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=650.24s)]
*  and they want to rule Gaza. And that's unacceptable. So we have to know that. We had to know what they [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=655.04s)]
*  wanted. What they want is unacceptable. What's acceptable to us is they need to demilitarize. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=660.72s)]
*  Then maybe they could stay there a little bit, right? Be involved politically, but they can't [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=666.0s)]
*  be involved. We can't have a terrorist organization running Gaza, because that won't be acceptable to [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=670.0s)]
*  Israel. Then we'll just have the same exact experiences. Every five, 10, 15 years, we're [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=676.08s)]
*  going to have an October 27th. Yes. October 7th, pardon me. So that's what Hamas wants. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=682.88s)]
*  That's not possible. What do they like to deal with? I've never really, I've never been in the [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=689.0400000000001s)]
*  same room as them, which is a little bit weird, wouldn't you say? Like a negotiation where you [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=695.9200000000001s)]
*  don't have the other party. You don't even know if the guy behind the wall is the Wizard of Oz, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=701.28s)]
*  or he's not the Wizard of Oz, right? So how do you keep, I mean, without giving away anything [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=706.88s)]
*  that you can't play. I think we trust the Qataris. If I didn't trust the Qataris, then that would be [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=712.64s)]
*  really problematic, not meeting with Hamas. And of course, you know, we read- So you can communicate [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=717.52s)]
*  with Hamas through the Qataris. Right. And Sheikh Mohammed, the prime minister of Qatar, is a good [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=722.9599999999999s)]
*  man. He's really- He certainly is a good man. He's a special guy. He really is. And he cares, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=728.4s)]
*  and I've spent a lot of time with him and broken bread with him. And he's just a good, decent human [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=732.3199999999999s)]
*  being who wants what's best for his people. But also, like what you were alluding to before, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=739.04s)]
*  he's able to put himself in the shoes of the Israelis, of the United States. And I think, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=745.1999999999999s)]
*  explain to the Qataris, excuse me, explain to Hamas where they're going to have to get to, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=750.72s)]
*  to make a deal. And do, I mean, from an American perspective, like it's just hard to even [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=756.4s)]
*  understand what Hamas is thinking, or do you, but it's essential to understand. I mean, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=764.3199999999999s)]
*  it's just as a procedural matter, we need to know. Correct. So is it hard for you to understand? Like, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=768.9599999999999s)]
*  do you feel like you can effectively communicate with them, even through proxy, and understand [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=775.28s)]
*  what they want and what their, you know, what their red lines are or whatever? Can you negotiate [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=781.28s)]
*  with them? Well, it's hard. You know, I'll give you an example of what makes it hard. I went to Gaza, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=786.0s)]
*  and then I had this fabulous lunch with CENCOM people, you know, military guys. Yeah. I shook [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=793.2s)]
*  hands with everybody I met because who doesn't want to shake the hand of these guys who are out [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=798.72s)]
*  in the field? You know, they, they, they protect our country. I'm talking about our military guys. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=802.8s)]
*  And then they showed me, this is Southern Command of Israel, then showed me a film of what happened [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=809.28s)]
*  on October 7th. Yeah. And the film is horrific. Yes. It is about mass rapes. Yeah. There's pictures [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=813.92s)]
*  of, of Hamas, people cutting the head off of an Israeli soldier. I watched them saw the head off. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=822.88s)]
*  I mean, it's, it's really terrible stuff. And it's beyond what I've ever seen. And it contain you, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=830.7199999999999s)]
*  right? It can, it can taint the way you're going to, you know, the way you're going to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=837.04s)]
*  feel about these people. And I think sometimes as a, as a negotiator, you have to be dispassionate. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=841.36s)]
*  Yes. It's not easy to be, to, to, to make decisions if you're going to, but I had to see that film, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=851.2s)]
*  Tucker. I mean, that film is a reality. I mean, we can't ignore the reality of what happened on [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=857.84s)]
*  October 7th. Right. Now, they would tell you that they've got justification, but there's no [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=862.32s)]
*  justification for what happened that day. They're just, there just isn't. And unfortunately, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=867.2s)]
*  there were security lapses that day that shouldn't have happened, that accentuated what happened that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=871.76s)]
*  day, which shouldn't have happened. But, um, do we understand that? I think we understand that there [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  were security lapses, that there were some mistakes that were made. Yes. But we're humans, we're not [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=882.8000000000001s)]
*  robots. We're not, we're not, we're not, you know, we're not completely overwhelmed by AI right now. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=887.9200000000001s)]
*  So people will make mistakes. There were intelligence mistakes, but, um, but there's [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=893.04s)]
*  some really good people who were involved, uh, here. I, you know, I met some, I met some [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=897.92s)]
*  exceptional people in Israel. I mean, really some exceptional people who, and it's a difficult [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=903.12s)]
*  situation, but, um, I think you have to know what Hamas wants just to go back to your question. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=907.68s)]
*  Yes. And then you've got to figure out what you can give them that allows them to walk out, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=913.92s)]
*  because that's what's needed here. You know, what we heard in the beginning of this conflict is [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=921.1999999999999s)]
*  Hamas is ideological. They're prepared to die for a whole variety of reasons. I personally, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=925.3599999999999s)]
*  and I talked to the president about this. There's nothing I don't talk to the president about [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  before we're going to make a decision because he's, he's, he is the guy. Yes. He was elected. I was [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=935.68s)]
*  not, none of the other people were, he was elected. And I think that's how we have to function. With [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=941.52s)]
*  that said, I said to him, I don't think that they are as ideologically locked in. They're not [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=946.16s)]
*  ideologically intractable. I don't, I never believe that by the way, I believe they strap on [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=953.8399999999999s)]
*  the suicide vests onto young kids who don't know what they're doing. Right. And they tell them a [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=959.8399999999999s)]
*  story. And once you understand that, once you understand that they wanted to live, then you [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=964.24s)]
*  were able to talk to them in a more effective way. Smart, smart. That is totally, that is smart. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=969.6s)]
*  Um, but it's how hard was it to come to that conclusion? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=974.32s)]
*  You know what? I get a lot of intelligence reports, so I'm able to read things. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=980.8s)]
*  And it just felt to me that the rhythm and the cadence of the negotiation, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=986.0s)]
*  that's part of it too. Right. If I'm not there all the time, I'm getting secondhand information. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=991.52s)]
*  I had to feel it for myself. I had to be able to sort of live it in, in, um, in, uh, in real time. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=996.8s)]
*  And that's when I, I sort of came to the conclusion that they wanted alternatives. We're in a [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1004.64s)]
*  negotiation right now to maybe stop some of these Israeli strikes and maybe finish this conflict [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1009.92s)]
*  with dialogue. And if I don't have a feeling that, uh, that we can accomplish that, why would I waste [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1016.24s)]
*  my time? Or the United States time? Or, and worse yet, why would I put the, why would I come to the [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1023.12s)]
*  president, recommend to him that we could finish something with dialogue and then effectively we [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1030.08s)]
*  can't, and then we can't be that effective. That's a, that's a bad policy prescription. If, if, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1035.12s)]
*  if I'm not in this thing, making those sorts of assessments and being able to come back to the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1040.08s)]
*  president and say, I think we can finish it with dialogue or not. And those, by the way, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1044.88s)]
*  those calculations are going to be the same with the Iranians and they're going to be the same with [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1052.16s)]
*  the Russians and the Ukrainians and they're going to be the same with Azerbaijan and Armenia. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1056.96s)]
*  So it, those principles apply to all of these conflicts that, that, uh, that, that we're going [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1062.32s)]
*  to maybe talk about today. So it's not a conspiracy theory. It turns out to say there's fraud in the [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1068.72s)]
*  government, whether it's mysterious 150 year olds cashing checks or dead people in the voter rolls, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1073.52s)]
*  the system is filled with fraud and its perpetrators are slipping through the cracks. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1079.52s)]
*  Who's protecting you exactly? Unless you're actively monitoring your personal data, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1083.92s)]
*  you are leaving yourself and your family exposed. Data hawks are constantly looking for ways to [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1088.56s)]
*  exploit your information, which is why we recommend identity guard. Identity guards, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1093.6s)]
*  real-time alerts, let you know if your information, whether it's your social security number, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1098.72s)]
*  your phone number, anything is under attack. Someone's trying to grab it on the internet. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1102.96s)]
*  So you know before they can. And when you need help, you'll not be stuck with frustrating and [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1108.16s)]
*  inhuman phone bots. Hello, may I help you? Says a computer. Identity guards, US based customer care [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1112.64s)]
*  team is available at all times. 24 seven, real people who will help you with identity guard. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1119.6000000000001s)]
*  You get $1 million in identity theft insurance. You get monitoring for social security number, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1125.3600000000001s)]
*  bank and investment accounts, home and auto titles and more. And it's cheap. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1130.48s)]
*  Identity guard is offering a 30 day free trial plus over 60% off to this show's listeners. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1134.8000000000002s)]
*  Go to identityguard.com slash Tucker to claim this deal. Sign up before your identity is stolen and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1140.16s)]
*  the damage is done. identityguard.com slash Tucker. I'm just gonna say this for a third time. I won't [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1146.48s)]
*  keep repeating myself, but that's just such a different way of looking at the conflict, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1152.16s)]
*  not just in Gaza, but in all the places you just mentioned, acknowledging that, you know, [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1157.6000000000001s)]
*  we're on, we're sympathetic to one side, but both sides have an interest and like the [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1163.84s)]
*  reason can still play a role in this. Negotiation can play a role. Dialogue can play a role. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1169.52s)]
*  I just, I haven't heard anybody say that in so long. And you've taken an enormous amount of abuse. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1175.04s)]
*  I don't even know if you're aware of it because you're always on an airplane, but like in US media [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1182.1599999999999s)]
*  and social media, attacking you is like an agent of all kinds of different foreign powers. You know, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1186.8799999999999s)]
*  he's working for Hamas. He's working for the Qataris. Like, does that penetrate at all? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1192.48s)]
*  You know, in the beginning, I didn't like it. Yeah, I bet. But one night I was reflecting on what [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1197.04s)]
*  someone told me after my son, Andrew died. And they said to me, you're never going to have a [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1204.08s)]
*  bigger hit than that in your life, losing a child. It's a bad club to be a member of. Oh, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1209.3600000000001s)]
*  there's nothing, nothing worse. Nothing worse. And then I began to get like President Trump, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1213.76s)]
*  not caring what people said. I'd wake up in the morning, read the paper. They, I'd read some sort [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1219.44s)]
*  of explanation about why I said something or did something. And it was preposterous, Tucker, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  just preposterous. So one day I was, what's that movie? There was some movie where they kept, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1230.96s)]
*  won the Academy. I can't remember the name. I just stopped caring. Yes. I just stopped caring [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1236.72s)]
*  about what the news media, news media said about me. So I, I've experienced a little bit of this [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1241.92s)]
*  myself, nothing compared to what you've just experienced, but it does seem like some of these [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1246.72s)]
*  criticisms of you are not actually sincere. Nobody really thinks you're like pro-Hamas or working [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1250.96s)]
*  for the Qataris. But the point is to throw you off balance and to sort of put a leash around your neck [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1257.1200000000001s)]
*  and control you. No doubt. Right? That's the agenda. That's the agenda. No doubt. And it seems to have [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1264.24s)]
*  had no effect from all sides, from all sides. Of course. Oh, absolutely. I, I had, I've had a couple [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1270.16s)]
*  of experiences where first I was attacked as being pro pro-Katari sympathizer. By the way, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1277.2s)]
*  Qatar is a mediator here. They're not a party to the conflict. They're a mediator. And by the way, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1283.44s)]
*  they've mediated all over the world. No different than the Swiss and the Norwegians. They've mediated [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1288.4s)]
*  in Russia. They've mediated in Afghanistan. God bless them. I know. And they've done an effective [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1293.44s)]
*  job. They're good at it. So I am, how could I not collaborate with the mediator and, and, and be, [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1298.64s)]
*  if I'm not collaborating with the mediator, I'm bound to be ineffective. It's not even possible [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1308.4s)]
*  that I could, that I could do the job. I had to know everything that they knew. So that means [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1313.1200000000001s)]
*  collaboration. And that's how president Trump operates too. You know, I learned the business [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1317.92s)]
*  from, from him. I went into the business because of him, the real estate business, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1323.92s)]
*  and this is his ethos. This is how he operates. And so I'm really following him in a, in a certain [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1328.24s)]
*  respect. I didn't realize you went into that. So I didn't know. I knew you'd known him forever. I [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1333.76s)]
*  didn't know that. Oh no, I wanted to be him by the way, everybody wanted to be him. He'd come to 101 [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1337.8400000000001s)]
*  park Avenue where I was a lawyer. He had this swashbuckling style. I used to, I used to see him [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1344.48s)]
*  come in and I used to say, God, I want to be him. I don't want to be, I don't want to, I don't want [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1351.2s)]
*  to be the lawyer. I don't want to be the Scrivener. I want to be that man. Yeah. I can remember saying [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1355.44s)]
*  that. Yeah. He was, he was like the Michael Jordan to me, you know, of the real estate business. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1361.52s)]
*  It's incredible. The turns your life has taken. It's just incredible. Well, when you have a chance [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1366.4s)]
*  to sort it out, when all this is over, I think you're going to look at your own life and say, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1370.48s)]
*  well, that was amazing. Well, I've been blessed. I mean, it used to be that I couldn't use the word [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1373.8400000000001s)]
*  blessing because of, because of my boy of his death, but now I can say I was blessed, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1378.56s)]
*  but for this overwhelming tragedy. And I think my son Tucker allows me to be, to have this sense of, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1384.48s)]
*  I relate to a lot of the hostage families, you know, many of these families are never going to [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1392.8s)]
*  get their children back. The children's, the children have either been killed or may in fact [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1396.88s)]
*  get killed if we don't successfully get to a peace program in, in Gaza. So I think that this [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1403.04s)]
*  sense of sensitivity or empathy that I have, I can relate to them. I, they all have my telephone [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1411.28s)]
*  numbers. I talk to them on a daily basis. And I think that's been a big, it's been a big help for [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1417.6000000000001s)]
*  them, but interestingly enough, it's been a big help for me. I believe that. And I talked to the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1423.52s)]
*  president about this. I had hostage families in the Oval Office the other day. The president was [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1427.36s)]
*  tired. And he said to me, he knew they were at my office and he said, bring them up. Let me, you [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1433.6s)]
*  know, at least say hello to them and, and, and, and get connected to them, but, but let them know [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  I only have a couple of minutes, cause it was a hectic day. He spent an hour and a half with them, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1445.12s)]
*  talked to every one of them, gave them his challenge coin. Every one of them listened to their [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1449.4399999999998s)]
*  stories. People who talked about children who might not come home. Many of them, many of these [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1454.4s)]
*  people were captives themselves, hostages. You know, it's a very real experience when, when you [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1460.64s)]
*  sit there and you listen to what it was like. Some of these people who lived in cages were, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1468.72s)]
*  were chained 24 hours a day had, you know, we talked about what, what it was like to find a [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1473.2800000000002s)]
*  bathroom, right? Or, or what it was like to live in the dark or to be starving to death, you know, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1478.72s)]
*  as some of them were, or to have, watch people be murdered. And the president, as a president, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1485.44s)]
*  he doesn't have to do that if he doesn't want to, he could sort of get the information just from me, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1490.8s)]
*  but he's, it's, it's up close and personal for him. And that way of doing things guides people [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1495.84s)]
*  like me who work for him. Now I want to get up close and personal. That's why I went to Gaza. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1502.8s)]
*  I was the first US official to go to Gaza in 22 years. But how would you implement the peace [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1507.92s)]
*  deal if you didn't go to the place where the peace deal was being implemented? I mean, it's curious, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  right? Like who would not, who would try to get, who would get, try to get a peace deal done? And [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1518.0s)]
*  then the, it's all in the implementation. So what, what the contract says, what the writing says, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1522.5600000000002s)]
*  now we have to figure out that the battlefield conditions, nobody had been there. It's, it's [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1526.96s)]
*  kind of crazy. Well, it is crazy. And it's connected to what you've been saying for the last 20 minutes, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1532.64s)]
*  which is you have to understand all sides if you want to affect the outcome that you've decided [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1537.44s)]
*  you want. And correct. Yes. But again, that's a revolutionary development in American diplomacy. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1542.4s)]
*  And I just am thrilled to see it. So finally, the biggest player in all of this, of course, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1549.28s)]
*  is the government of Israel. What do they want? What is the government of Israel leaving aside [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1553.68s)]
*  the population of Israel? I have no idea. But what is the government making these decisions want? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1559.52s)]
*  Well, I think that's complicated. I think they're well motivated. I think they, they, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1564.3200000000002s)]
*  there are things that they're trying to get done. You know, as an example, we would not be as [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1569.8400000000001s)]
*  effective in what we're doing there. If BB did not get Nez Ralla out of the picture and let it on, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1575.52s)]
*  if he did not decapitate, because he's effectively decapitated Hezbollah, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1582.5600000000002s)]
*  if he did not do what he did with Hamas, he's decapitated Hamas. Hamas is nowhere close to [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1587.44s)]
*  the terrorist organization that they were beforehand. Both of those events inform on [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1594.1599999999999s)]
*  his relationship with Iran and Iran using continuing to use proxies and so forth. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1603.04s)]
*  They're less prone to do those sorts of things today. Right. And so that that sort of Iranian [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1608.8799999999999s)]
*  crescent or that Islamist crescent that everybody thought was was was going to be effective, it's [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1614.8s)]
*  it's been largely eliminated. So he's he's done an exceptional job with that. But of course, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1621.36s)]
*  the rap he gets is that he's more concerned about the fight than he is about the hostages. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1625.9199999999998s)]
*  I think in some respects, I understand how people make that assessment. But I don't necessarily [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1630.96s)]
*  agree with it. I think that he does want to get hostages home, if he can, but he believes that [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1637.04s)]
*  that pressure pressuring Hamas is the only way to do it. I think in some respects, he's right. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1644.1599999999999s)]
*  Look, the nuances here, the changes that happen there on a day to day basis. We were in at the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1652.0s)]
*  Arab summit a week and a half ago, we made a proposal to the to Hamas. They considered it, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1660.0s)]
*  they rejected it the next day. We thought it was unacceptable that they rejected it. Three days [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1666.32s)]
*  later, the Israelis went in, guess what, they're talking again. Stuff changes there, Tucker. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1670.88s)]
*  Hour to hour, you really have to stay on top of it. I think BB feels that he's doing the right [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1677.5200000000002s)]
*  thing. I think he goes up against public opinion because most because public opinion there once [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1684.48s)]
*  those hostages home. That's what we've been in Israel in Israel. Yeah, you don't get that sense, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1690.0800000000002s)]
*  I don't think from American media, but Israel has always been, you know, there's been a robust debate [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1694.8000000000002s)]
*  since, you know, I started going to Israel, you know, they have a very vigorous debate [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  internally about their government. Like it's, you know, people feel free to say, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1706.0s)]
*  I went to hostage square and I went with a detail and my guys were afraid for me to get out. There [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1710.8000000000002s)]
*  were, I don't know, four or five thousand people there and I, we were passing by and I said, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1720.72s)]
*  let's stop. You know, it was, there was no plan to go there. Let's stop. We didn't have a lot of [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1727.44s)]
*  security with us. I knew it was going to be fine. I knew it. I came in there. I spent almost an hour [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1732.56s)]
*  there. It was spiritual. All the families were there. Hostages who had been released with their [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1739.2s)]
*  people were crying. I look getting the, this has infected Israel. It's, it's, it's fractured Israel. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1745.44s)]
*  It's like a seam cutting right through the soul of the country. We've got to get these people back. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1754.56s)]
*  I, I talked to, by the way, I talked to Bibi about it. I talked to Dermar about it, but, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1760.56s)]
*  you know, they also have a view strategically about Hamas, how they have to be dealt with. I'm [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1765.04s)]
*  not sure I, in some respects, there are times that I, we agree with each other. There are times we [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1770.8799999999999s)]
*  slightly disagree, but I think they're well motivated is, is, is my point. And our policy is [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1776.24s)]
*  that Hamas cannot, cannot continue to exist here. That's the president's policy. And I'm a, I'm a, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1781.84s)]
*  I'm a, you know, I'm someone who follows the president because he's the one who got elected. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1789.6799999999998s)]
*  And I, and I believe in his policy. And he got elected on, I think a pretty clear vision [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1795.4399999999998s)]
*  of how he wanted to manage the world to the extent that we can. And again, it was, you know, and no [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1800.1599999999999s)]
*  more chaos. And to the extent you can avoid it, no more wars. And Americans really responded to that. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1806.48s)]
*  And the world understands that. Like everyone kind of knows that's the agenda. And you've said [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1813.92s)]
*  many times, we talk through what we want the outcome to be before we begin the tactical [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1818.08s)]
*  considerations. I, just in my traveling, there are a lot of Gulf countries that are, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1824.8s)]
*  you know, have extensive, very much more than people understand relations with Israel. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1830.96s)]
*  Some have signed the accord, others haven't, but they all deal with the Israelis all the time. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1834.48s)]
*  They're not hostile to the Israelis, but not one person I've spoken to understands what the long [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1839.52s)]
*  term vision is. Like, what's the plan here? What are we, you know, if you get everything you want, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1845.6000000000001s)]
*  what does it look like? Right. Do you understand it? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1849.28s)]
*  Well, I understand we have to have that notion. I understand that we have to be outcome oriented. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1852.24s)]
*  We're operating myopically if we're not outcome oriented. If we don't, I mean, peace, stability, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1858.3999999999999s)]
*  the Gulf Coast could be one of the most undervalued opportunities if we get peace and stability [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1866.1599999999999s)]
*  throughout the region. If we solve Iran and you can finance in that market, the Israelis are [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1871.84s)]
*  brilliant from a technological standpoint. They've got a huge technological, you know, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1877.1999999999998s)]
*  they've got a huge technological base there. Yes. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1884.08s)]
*  They're in AI, robotics, blockchain. That's where the UAE is today. I know. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1890.8s)]
*  That's where Saudi Arabia is today. That's where Qatar is today. Can you imagine all these countries [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1895.04s)]
*  working collaboratively together and creating that type of market? It could be much bigger [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1900.08s)]
*  than Europe. Europe is dysfunctional today. Imagine if they became functional and everybody's a [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1904.72s)]
*  business guy there. It could be amazing. I completely agree. I think the core question [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1909.84s)]
*  is the map. You know, for thousands of years it's been about the land. What does the map look like? [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1914.8s)]
*  Who controls what? And it's clearly had a destabilizing effect on some of the poor, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1919.84s)]
*  more populated countries. No doubt. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1926.6399999999999s)]
*  Specifically Jordan and Egypt, a hundred million people in Egypt. I think it might be helpful for [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1928.72s)]
*  everybody if there was just a clear picture of when this is all done, here's what we want the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1935.36s)]
*  map to be and then we can debate that. Do you have any sense of what the map would look like [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1938.88s)]
*  from Israel's perspective? When you say the map, you mean what? What countries? [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1943.2s)]
*  Well, what? Okay. So Israel's moved into Lebanon and Syria. They're not part of Israel, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1947.6000000000001s)]
*  but they control them. So when all this is over, what does the Israeli government hope to control? [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1953.5200000000002s)]
*  And then if that were clear, then I think people would say, you know, they could either live with [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1959.92s)]
*  it or they can't, but it would have a calming effect if people knew what the goal was. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1964.96s)]
*  So I would say the goal begins with how do we deal with Iran? That's the biggie. So the first is [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1971.3600000000001s)]
*  nuclear. We cannot have that. And we can talk about it in this session how bold it was for the [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1978.88s)]
*  president to send that letter because many would not. And that's an important thing, but I'll leave [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1987.44s)]
*  it to the end. So it begins with Iranian nuclear, but most importantly, because Iranian nuclear, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1992.32s)]
*  if they were to have a bomb that would create North Korea in the GCC. We cannot have that. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=1999.52s)]
*  North Korea, where they are, has outsized influence as a very small nation. We can never [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2005.9199999999998s)]
*  allow someone to have a nuclear weapon and have outsized influence. That doesn't work. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2010.96s)]
*  So if we can solve for that, which I'm hopeful that we can, and we can talk about that too. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2017.76s)]
*  The next thing we need to deal with Iran is that they're being a benefactor of these proxy armies, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2024.0s)]
*  because we've proven that that's not existential. They, for all intents and purposes, destroyed [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2029.68s)]
*  Hezbollah. So they're not really an existential risk. Hamas, same thing. The Houthis, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2036.1599999999999s)]
*  we're having, you know, we're in a conflict with them today. I think we'll prove that they won't [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2042.88s)]
*  be an existential risk either. But if we can get these terrorist organizations eliminated as risks, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2048.08s)]
*  not existential, but still risk, they're destabilizing risks, then we'll normalize [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2055.92s)]
*  everywhere. I think Lebanon could normalize with Israel, literally. Normalize meaning a peace treaty [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2061.44s)]
*  with the two countries. That's really possible. Syria too. The indications are that Jelani [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2067.52s)]
*  is a different person than he once was. And people do change. You at 55 are completely different [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2074.64s)]
*  than when, than how you were at 35. That's for sure. And I say to myself, I'm a different person [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2080.16s)]
*  today at 68 years old. I'm not the person I knew 30 years ago. So maybe Jelani in Syria is a different [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  guy. They've driven Iran out. Imagine if Lebanon normalizes, Syria normalizes, and the Saudis sign [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2094.8s)]
*  a normalization treaty with Israel because there's a peace in Gaza. They must have that as a, as a, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2103.92s)]
*  without question, as a prerequisite. That's a condition precedent to Saudi normalizing. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2109.1200000000003s)]
*  But now you'd begin to have a GCC that all work together. I mean, that would be, it would be epic. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2114.88s)]
*  And I think it'd be good for the world. For sure it would be good for the world because [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2122.56s)]
*  Europe is dying, unfortunately. And so the United States needs allies abroad. And those are, those [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2127.6s)]
*  are all potential allies. Well, they are allies already. I couldn't agree with you more. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2133.84s)]
*  And remember, Tucker, one more thing as a, as a condition in that region, you have young [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2138.48s)]
*  leadership. You have young leadership in MBS. You have relatively young leadership in the UAE. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2145.68s)]
*  You have relatively young leadership, new leadership in Qatar, people who don't have the old [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2152.8s)]
*  sensibilities, people who want to have, want to do business, who realizes like Trump's way is people [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2158.8s)]
*  vote their pocketbook, right? So he wants to bring the bacon home to the United States. I think [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2166.8s)]
*  everybody's bought into that over in the GCC. I agree. I mean, we're reverting to like human [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2171.44s)]
*  nature. People want stability and prosperity for sure. Correct. But looming over all of these [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2175.76s)]
*  countries and their remarkable success, both economically and socially, they're just like [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2180.88s)]
*  great countries, in my opinion. Is this, is, you know, is the conflict in Gaza and not just Gaza, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2185.76s)]
*  but the idea that, wow, this could all blow up tomorrow because we don't know [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2193.36s)]
*  what the Israeli plan is. And even people who should know don't seem to know. And do you think [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2197.2s)]
*  at some point they will articulate like, here's our plan? I think so. First of all, I think that [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2204.0s)]
*  the president, President Trump's approach to Gaza has engendered a lot of lively discussion [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2210.24s)]
*  about different ways to deal with Gaza. We're now seeing an Egyptian plan. We're seeing us, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2218.7999999999997s)]
*  the Saudis put together a white paper. So I think what we're going to do with Gaza is going to [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2224.32s)]
*  become much more apparent over the next six to 12 months. But Gaza is a flashpoint. And we've got [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2229.84s)]
*  to figure that out. And I agree with the president when he said the old plans don't work. The old [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  plans, the last 40, 50 years of policy prescription in Gaza meant war, rebuild, more war, more [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2242.48s)]
*  rebuilding. That's not something that made any sense, which is why the president began to say, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2252.0s)]
*  maybe we need to think about it in a different way. Now we got criticized for it because that's [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2258.32s)]
*  what happens when you begin to go up against the old way of thinking and you want to sort of [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2262.64s)]
*  introduce a new way of thinking. Well, a new way of thinking is definitely needed. I think everybody [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2269.52s)]
*  realizes that. So we're not positive that cryptocurrency is the future of finance, but we do [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2273.92s)]
*  know that what we have now is broken and dangerous. Debt has never been higher in this country. Many [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2278.24s)]
*  of our so-called leaders are getting rich, serving you. It's a scam. So where does it go? Well, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2283.4399999999996s)]
*  thankfully there are options. Donald Trump has said repeatedly he wants the United States to be the [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2288.8799999999997s)]
*  crypto capital of the world. He's already created the Crypto Advisory Council and recently signed [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2293.6s)]
*  an executive order to establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve. This could give normal people an alternative [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2298.0s)]
*  to the government's failing system and frankly to the US dollar. I'm not saying put all your money [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2304.48s)]
*  outside the US dollar, but like, don't be crazy. Don't be stupid here. You can see where it's going. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2309.04s)]
*  So the people at iTrust Capital can help you get in to this. It's complicated for people who aren't [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2313.28s)]
*  following it. They make it easy. They're based 100% in the United States of America. We looked into [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2319.28s)]
*  this. They service only American investors and they operate the only platform that allows you [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2323.76s)]
*  to buy and sell crypto 24-7, both inside and outside of your tax-advantaged IRA. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2328.88s)]
*  And it all happens on one easy-to-use dashboard. They also operate a closed loop system, meaning [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2334.0s)]
*  that bad actors can't access your account and steal your money. So if you're considering adding [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2339.76s)]
*  Bitcoin if you want to, or some other cryptocurrency portfolio, iTrust can be trusted and it's easy to [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2344.88s)]
*  understand. iTrustCapital.com or click the link below. One question, I don't know if it's answerable. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2351.6800000000003s)]
*  I've just noticed it. I was talking to some Israeli government people yesterday. And so here [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2357.92s)]
*  you have October 7th, obviously traumatic to Israel, but you get the destruction of the [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2364.64s)]
*  leadership of Hamas. You expelled, you broke Hezbollah. Nasrallah is dead. I was there for the [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2372.56s)]
*  2006 war. No one ever thought that was going to happen. I didn't anyway. That happened. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2378.4s)]
*  And Bashar al-Assad's gone from Syria and there's a more kind of pro-Israel [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2382.8799999999997s)]
*  Jalani leader in Syria. So that seems like from an Israeli perspective, those seem like [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2387.7599999999998s)]
*  massive wins that nobody thought were possible. And yet I detect in the people I know in Israel [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2392.72s)]
*  a feeling like they feel more under threat almost. Do you feel that? [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2400.16s)]
*  Well, I think, you know, I go to Israel quite often. Yeah. And I think there's a feeling of, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2405.4399999999996s)]
*  with some, when does the violence end? At what point have we had enough of it? And I think [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2411.12s)]
*  that's the issue. And, you know, maybe the Israeli government needs to do, look, I understand where [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2417.84s)]
*  they're coming from. Their central premise or thesis is that Hamas cannot be allowed to live on. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2426.16s)]
*  And I think we're talking about now demilitarizing. That's the big thing. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2435.92s)]
*  I don't think anyone has a feeling that you can just sort of kill off a Hamas. It's an idea, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2442.4s)]
*  right? That's what Hamas is about. It's an ideological idea. But they can't be allowed [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2450.56s)]
*  to ever again ferment alongside of the Muslim Brotherhood, alongside of Islamic Jihad. These [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2456.96s)]
*  rural groups that are operating in Gaza today. We just can't have an October 7th ever again. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2464.8s)]
*  Now October 7th was like 9-11. What 9-11 was in the United States, October 7th was the Israeli's [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2469.36s)]
*  version of. But what's interesting is it happened at exactly the moment that it felt like things [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2475.76s)]
*  were on track to get better. I mean, Abraham Accords have been signed, Saudi didn't sign. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2480.96s)]
*  Right. But, you know, there was some thought that they might, I think. I mean, it was. And so, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2484.8s)]
*  the trajectory was like that. And all of a sudden, it just went in the opposite direction. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2490.3999999999996s)]
*  And so then the question becomes, well, how do you build a framework where there's an enduring [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2496.72s)]
*  peace and everyone can just go on with living their lives and building their businesses and all that? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2504.4799999999996s)]
*  Well, we're going to need a very good plan on Gaza. It's going to begin with that. We're going to need [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2508.3199999999997s)]
*  stability on Gaza. Stability on Gaza could mean some people come back. It could mean some people [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  don't come back. But I believe we have to get to a place where people can live a better life [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2519.92s)]
*  in Gaza. And we have to have a plan for that. That involves housing. But it also involves [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2525.44s)]
*  these people's aspirations. What is going to happen for their children? Or their children, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2531.12s)]
*  children like our children? You want better for your kids. I want better for my kids. I want them [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2536.8s)]
*  to go and get an education, to be self-sufficient. I don't think Gazan people have ever really feel [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2542.08s)]
*  that way about it. We feel that way. They don't have that opportunity for their families. We have [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2551.04s)]
*  to give them that opportunity or find pathways for them to pursue those opportunities. That's what [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2556.64s)]
*  President Trump was talking about when he talked about a new way of thinking about Gaza. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2562.24s)]
*  So, and we're going to attempt to ascertain different development plans for Gaza. Could [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2566.2400000000002s)]
*  involve the word to state. Could not involve the word to state. What about that? You don't hear [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2574.4s)]
*  that anymore. I mean, for my whole life, the stated aspiration was a Palestinian state, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2579.2000000000003s)]
*  like an actual state. And then the debate was over what it would look like and who controls [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2585.84s)]
*  the utilities and airports and all that stuff. But lots of details to hammer out. But man, I [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2589.84s)]
*  haven't in the past five or six, 10 years heard anybody in authority even mention it. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2594.4s)]
*  Because when you use those words, it's like a flash point. Right? So I use the word, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2602.1600000000003s)]
*  I can be attacked for it. To me, it's just a word. Right? What to state to me means is, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2608.08s)]
*  how do we have a better living prescription for Palestinians who are living in Gaza? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2614.08s)]
*  Let's get to that place. But it's not just about housing. Maybe it's about AI coming there. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2621.52s)]
*  Maybe it's about hyperscale data centers being seeded into that area. Because we need to have [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2627.2000000000003s)]
*  that. And these people can now take advantage and we can create jobs for them there. Maybe it's [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2633.6000000000004s)]
*  about blockchain and robotics coming there. Maybe it's about pharmaceutical manufacturing coming [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2638.5600000000004s)]
*  there. We need, we can't rebuild Gaza and it be based on a welfare system. We have to give people [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2643.76s)]
*  prospects, economic and financial prospects. That's exactly right. You have to treat them [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2652.0800000000004s)]
*  like human beings, adults, you know? Where they have nothing. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2656.0800000000004s)]
*  Interesting. So you think by saying to state, I mean, that's a controversial thing to say now. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2660.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2667.2s)]
*  But obviously you don't care. So do you think the ceasefire that you on the president's behalf got [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2670.08s)]
*  the ceasefire? I mean, that was my read anyway. You went to Israel and said the president wants [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2676.7999999999997s)]
*  this and you got it. But then it ended. What are the prospects now? What do you think happens next? [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2681.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, let me say this. We got it because they didn't want to defy him. He's a bad guy to defy. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2688.3199999999997s)]
*  The Israelis? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2694.96s)]
*  No, president Trump. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2695.76s)]
*  No, but the Israelis did not want to defy Trump. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2697.0400000000004s)]
*  But not just the Israelis. It was the Israelis. It was Hamas. It was Qatar wanting, you know, [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2699.2000000000003s)]
*  everybody had to know that we needed to pull in the same way. And we got, there was a lot of [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2706.48s)]
*  miscommunication in that deal. Lots. We cleaned up the miscommunication. That was the game plan. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2713.76s)]
*  And, but it was the president's, his sort of overarching personality. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2719.76s)]
*  And letting everybody know that success was not an option. It had to be. It was a mandate. And [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2726.0800000000004s)]
*  that's how we got to that place. I mean, it would take me a 10 hour interview to explain to you the [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2735.28s)]
*  ins and outs of how we actually got there. But the story was that you just kind of rolled in [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  and said, here's what we're doing. This is what the president wants. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2746.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, that's what he would do. So that's what I did. Because that's what he would do. He would [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2749.8399999999997s)]
*  roll in and say, this is unacceptable. This is what we need to have happen. And that's effectively [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2755.6s)]
*  what I did. By the way, why not? Why reinvent the wheel? Why not copy the master? He's the master. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2761.2799999999997s)]
*  So why not copy the strategy? It's worked effectively. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2768.96s)]
*  When I saw you do that on his behalf, my first thought was, why didn't the Biden people do this? [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2771.6s)]
*  I mean, they lost for a lot of reasons. But one of the reasons they lost was the ongoing [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2776.08s)]
*  Gaza conflict. And that alienated a ton of their voters. I mean, that was a crisis for them. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2781.68s)]
*  Muslims in Southeast Michigan voted for Trump in part because of that. And like a lot of them did, [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2787.6s)]
*  never thought I'd live to see that. And Orthodox Jews voted for him too, which was like amazing. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2794.56s)]
*  So why didn't they knew it was hurting them? Why didn't they do that? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2799.44s)]
*  Because Joe Biden is not Donald Trump. It's as simple as that. So you think about it, when [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2804.4s)]
*  his policymakers walked into the Oval Office, were they going to get that sort of direct mandate from [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2811.28s)]
*  him? And my eye was not there. So so this is just a thesis. My bet is not. I walk into the Oval Office, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2818.96s)]
*  Tucker, it's purposeful. That's what it feels like. We're there to get solutions, to agree on [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2827.76s)]
*  solutions, and then to decide on how tactically we're going to get to that place. That's what we do. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2835.6800000000003s)]
*  We sit in the Oval Office. I could be sitting there with Suzy Wiles, John Radcliffe, Mike Waltz, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2842.6400000000003s)]
*  the Secretary of State Marco Rubio, I mean, exceptional human beings, Tulsi Gabbard. And [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2848.7999999999997s)]
*  yeah, we have some fun together because it's a very tight knit team. He's got a great team this [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2858.56s)]
*  year, that he's put into place this year. And hopefully they'll all be there for the entire term. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2863.92s)]
*  But we're there to be solution based. And it's a collaborative conversation with the president [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2869.52s)]
*  leading the conversation. He's interested in a lot of different opinions, which I think is the, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2876.64s)]
*  you know, underscores what a great leader he is. He's not stuck on a view. He's prepared to consider [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2882.0s)]
*  different things. I think that makes him a great leader. I think people have that misconception [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2888.24s)]
*  about him that, you know, he wakes up in the morning and, you know, this is the way it's going [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2892.7999999999997s)]
*  to be. No, he listens. He's intent on understanding different viewpoints. That's for sure. He's [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2896.4s)]
*  prepared to be flexible in his thinking. I think that's what comes from a lifetime of experience. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2902.72s)]
*  And I think it's a great example to all of us who work for him because we go out with [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2908.48s)]
*  that way of thinking too, for the most part. Do you think there's a hope for a cessation of violence [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2913.2s)]
*  in Gaza like soon? I do. I do. I mean, I'm not at liberty at this moment to talk about. I bet [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2922.72s)]
*  you're not. But I think there have been signs. I think the Israelis going in is in some respects [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2928.96s)]
*  unfortunate and in some respects falls into the had to be bucket. It kind of had to be. Hamas was [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2939.44s)]
*  not responding. They were not. And their responses were unreasonable. And I, you know, look, I warned [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2951.84s)]
*  everybody at the Arab summit. We presented a proposal at the Arab summit 10 days ago or two [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2962.2400000000002s)]
*  weeks ago that was reasonable, that was a bridge to get to a peace deal, a bridge to get to [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2968.32s)]
*  demilitarization of Hamas and a discussion about an enduring truce. That's what I was presenting [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2974.7200000000003s)]
*  10 days ago. And Hamas, their reaction was completely inappropriate. That's inappropriate [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2983.2000000000003s)]
*  is probably a light word. But I warned everybody that this was going to result in some sort of [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=2992.7200000000003s)]
*  military action. Not because I know. I did not know before the Israelis went in. I just sensed [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3000.56s)]
*  that that was going to be the only alternative based on Hamas's reaction. Now, that may not, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3005.92s)]
*  we may be able to reverse things. We may be able to use this to get Hamas to be a whole lot more [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3011.44s)]
*  reasonable because they have a lot of sway there. And they impose that sway at the point of a gun, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3018.32s)]
*  which is why we have to demilitarize them. We need real elections in Gaza. There has to be a whole [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3023.84s)]
*  new way of thinking. We need a real security force there to ensure to Israel that they're not [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3030.0s)]
*  going to have a problem with them long-term. If Israel thinks they're going to have a problem [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3035.84s)]
*  in Gaza because Hamas is going to be there long-term, this is never going to end. So the [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3039.76s)]
*  only way to deal with this conflict is to make sure that we satisfy everybody, that we're not [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3044.08s)]
*  going to have, we're never going to have an October 7th ever again. There is huge concern, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3051.12s)]
*  as I know you know, from a lot of the neighboring countries that the conflict in Gaza, which is, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3057.52s)]
*  of course, streamed in everyone's iPhone, a lot of people have been killed in Gaza, a lot of kids, [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3063.68s)]
*  and that's inflaming the populations of some of these countries, again, specifically Egypt and [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3069.52s)]
*  Jordan, to such a point that those governments could fall and cause massive chaos, including [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3074.16s)]
*  in Europe. Is that a factor, that worry, is that a factor? [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3080.24s)]
*  It's a huge factor. It's a huge factor. I think King Abdullah in Jordan has done an amazing job, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3085.9199999999996s)]
*  amazing job, of figuring out how to deal with that instability. But, you know, in some respects, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3094.72s)]
*  he's been lucky. I think Egypt is a flashpoint. All the good that happened in the [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3104.96s)]
*  Ioun election because of Nasrallah and Sinwar being eliminated, that could all be reversed [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3110.8s)]
*  if we lose Egypt. What happened in Syria was a huge data point for the region. I mean, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3118.88s)]
*  getting him out, Assad, was a big deal, and no one ever expected it. But Egypt [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3126.4s)]
*  is, has a very restive, I want to say the stats in Egypt are huge unemployment among, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3133.68s)]
*  1 to 25, like 45% unemployment. A country can't exist like that. They're largely broke. They need [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3142.0s)]
*  a lot of help. If we have a bad event in Egypt, it could be, it could take us back. And Saudi [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3148.8799999999997s)]
*  Arabia also, large, you know, I mean, he's an amazing leader, MBS, but people are worried about [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3156.8s)]
*  his young population and how they're looking at this whole thing, which is why we've got to solve [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3164.6400000000003s)]
*  Gaza, because if we solve Gaza, which is the condition precedent to Saudi normalizing, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3169.84s)]
*  then Saudi can normalize. And if they normalize, we're building on the framework of [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3176.4s)]
*  of the Abraham peace accords, which of course is the president's creation. He wants the Abraham [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3183.2000000000003s)]
*  peace accords to be augmented. And we're in the process of doing it. We think we're going to be [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3191.36s)]
*  announcing several new countries who are joining. So would it's it feels like I don't know, I'm not [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3197.2000000000003s)]
*  there, but it feels like there's some significant unrest in Turkey. Yeah. And this being driven by [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3204.08s)]
*  this being driven by what's happening in Syria, which of course, Turkey participated in the [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3210.56s)]
*  Erdogan is seen by some in his country as a tool of Israel or what I mean, if if you had like real [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3216.16s)]
*  problems in Turkey, that would be like a global disaster, of course, because they've got this [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3223.12s)]
*  massive military. Is there a lot of concern about that? Well, I think there was, but I think the [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3227.68s)]
*  president had a great conversation with Erdogan a couple of days ago, really transformational, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3233.2799999999997s)]
*  I would describe it. I mean, it's I think it's gone. I think it's been underreported to tell you [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3239.52s)]
*  the truth. Yeah. And I think it's underreported because of the hoodies, because of what happened [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3243.6s)]
*  with Israel and because of what's going on with Russia, Ukraine, it's not really, you know, a [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3250.16s)]
*  headline. But I think Tom Barrack, who's the ambassador there has done and will do an exceptional [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3254.56s)]
*  job. I think the president has a relationship with Erdogan, and that's going to be important. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3259.84s)]
*  And I think that there's there's there's some good coming. There's some just a lot of good, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3264.88s)]
*  positive news coming out of Turkey right now as a result of that conversation. So I think you'll [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3271.1200000000003s)]
*  see that in the reporting in the coming days. Good. So if you don't mind, I'd love to show here's the [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3276.1600000000003s)]
*  timeline, as I understand it as an observer. So you go over, you deliver the president's message, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3282.56s)]
*  there is a ceasefire in Gaza, which is you've said five times as a prerequisite to a lot of other [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3289.1200000000003s)]
*  things. Like it's hard to do anything with this open wound. So you do that and the president says, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3293.28s)]
*  wow, Steve Wittgoff, my friend from the real estate business, like you're really good at this, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3299.52s)]
*  sends you to Russia. Is that fair? It's not so far from the truth. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3305.28s)]
*  It's like I'm watching this because I knew you before. And I was like, this is the most amazing [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3312.48s)]
*  thing I've ever seen. I'm cheering you by the way. Where are we there with that conflict? [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3316.4s)]
*  What'd you say? I think we've made more progress. Again, by the way, look, I could talk her. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3322.96s)]
*  I'm not just saying it. Every solution comes as a result of president Trump. And I don't get paid to [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3330.32s)]
*  say that I say it because it is the absolute truth. Putin's got a huge respect for the president. And [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3338.4s)]
*  you know, you saw what happened in the Oval Office with Zelensky and the president, right? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3345.44s)]
*  I mean, disrespecting him is not a healthy way to have a good relationship. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3349.76s)]
*  The arrogance of small countries, it's like, get some perspective. I mean, come on. Can you [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3359.28s)]
*  imagine acting like that? And they're dependent on us. And we've been so good to them. I know. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3363.68s)]
*  And I think that's, but look, that's been corrected. And that's a really good thing. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3370.16s)]
*  It got corrected. And hopefully, we'll chalk it up to a misunderstanding and we'll get to a peace [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3374.48s)]
*  solution here. But I believe that we have made more progress in Russia in this Russian Ukraine [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3380.72s)]
*  conflict in the last eight weeks than anyone thought we would ever make. I hear people [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3388.4s)]
*  describe this last conversation that the president had with President Putin as, you know, unsuccessful. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3395.6s)]
*  It's preposterous, by the way. We talked throughout a two-hour conversation about [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3402.56s)]
*  an ultimate ceasefire. And there are conditions that the Russians will need for an ultimate [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3407.6s)]
*  ceasefire because an ultimate ceasefire for fire is complicated. A there's Kursk, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3412.4s)]
*  where Ukrainian troops are surrounded fact. And the Russian is within Russia. Kursk is within Russia. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3419.04s)]
*  The Russians have taken it back. Yeah. And they've got people trapped there. And the president doesn't [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3426.88s)]
*  want to see everybody getting killed. That's a significant battlefield condition that has to be [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3431.04s)]
*  dealt with. But on top of that- Is that acknowledged? Like, I don't know if the New York Times is [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3436.8s)]
*  writing that story right now. I think it gets lost a little bit. First of all, I think a lot of these [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3440.64s)]
*  newspaper stories are, they're agenda driven. Yes. People start out saying, I support the Ukrainians, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3447.04s)]
*  so I'm going to write the article in a certain way. Look, we want to, I want to see Ukraine come [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3454.16s)]
*  out of this, okay. I want to see Russia come out of it. Okay. Again, we're outcome oriented [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3461.04s)]
*  in this circumstance means that we need a deal that the Ukrainian people can live with. We have [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3466.16s)]
*  to sell it. There's going to be various Senate approvals that may, that may, that we may need [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3471.2s)]
*  here. And I mean, that's the political system we're in, that we're going to want everybody to be, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3476.7999999999997s)]
*  in some respect, satisfied. So we're going to want the Russians to be satisfied in some respect. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3482.72s)]
*  We're going to want the Ukrainians to be satisfied in some respect. We're talking to the Europeans. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3487.6s)]
*  When I say satisfied, feeling that we came out of this thing, okay, with a deal that everybody [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3491.68s)]
*  can live with. I think that we have moved Russia in ways that no one thought was possible. So in the [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3495.92s)]
*  last conversation, they agreed to an energy infrastructure ceasefire, which means Russia is [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3504.0s)]
*  not going to target Ukraine's energy infrastructure and Ukraine will not target Russia's energy [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3511.36s)]
*  infrastructure. They've never talked about that before. Here we are talking about that. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3517.6s)]
*  They've never talked about reinstituting the Black Sea moratorium on maritime hits, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3522.0s)]
*  Ukrainian firing, Ukraine firing on Russian ships, Russia firing on Ukrainian ships. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3529.6800000000003s)]
*  Now we're down to, and that's going to be implemented over the next week or so. There's [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3536.4s)]
*  some details that need to be discussed, but that became a part of that conversation. That's [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3541.36s)]
*  big stuff, really big stuff. What's the ultimate goal? The ultimate goal is a 30-day ceasefire [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3547.12s)]
*  during which time we discuss a permanent ceasefire. We're not far away from that, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3555.2s)]
*  but a 30-day ceasefire is something where we have to figure out what all the battlefield [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3560.4s)]
*  conditions are, which is why I began with Kursk. But Kursk is just the beginning of it because [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3565.92s)]
*  there's this 2000 kilometer, that's 1200 miles, this 2000 kilometer border between Ukraine and [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3570.4s)]
*  Russia where the Russian and Ukrainian troops are involved in, I don't know, 50, 60, 70, maybe 80 [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3578.48s)]
*  firefights throughout this border with all kinds of different conditions. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3587.6s)]
*  Putin asked me in the meeting, what should I do in a particular area where we have people [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3592.96s)]
*  surrounded and they don't want to give up? Do I kill them? How do I get them to give up? I'm [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3598.0s)]
*  happy not to kill everybody. I'm happy to get people to wave the white flag if I can get them [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3603.84s)]
*  to wave the white flag. And that one situation, Steve, this is him Putin talking to me, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3611.2s)]
*  is just one example of 70, 80, 90 different situations out there along this border, [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3618.0s)]
*  each one having different battlefield conditions, each one needing a separate conversation. That's [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3625.04s)]
*  what has to happen for a ceasefire and yet we're talking about it. That's a big, big deal. Our [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3631.3599999999997s)]
*  technical teams are going to be meeting in Jeddah beginning Monday. That's a big deal. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3637.92s)]
*  There's all kinds of good positive talk coming out of Russia about their willingness to consider [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3643.6s)]
*  all of these different things. And Zelensky had a wonderful conversation with the president [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3649.92s)]
*  after the president Putin's conversation the next day. And I think that indicates that they've got [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3655.04s)]
*  some degree of flexibility in the way that they've been thinking about finishing up this conflict. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3662.16s)]
*  So I am not to sound like a forever optimist, but I am very, very optimistic that we're going to be [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3667.44s)]
*  able to bring the two sides together. We have narrowed the issues so considerably. So I'm [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3675.2s)]
*  optimistic. Time for another True Life Alp story. I got a call from a friend of mine yesterday, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3680.7999999999997s)]
*  honestly, true story, who said his girlfriend had just broken up with him over Alp. He wouldn't stop. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3684.96s)]
*  And I thought to myself, that's kind of sad. And he said, no, it's not sad. Imagine if I'd married [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3691.04s)]
*  her. Now I know I was saved. Then the next day, this same friend is driving at twice the speed [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3696.24s)]
*  limit through a major American city pulled over by a cop in a speed trap. Cop takes his license [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3703.2s)]
*  registration, goes back to the patrol car, runs him, comes back, looks in the window and sees a [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3707.2799999999997s)]
*  tin of Alp on the dashboard, pauses, stunned, says to my friend, you use Alp? Yeah, I do, says my friend. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3711.12s)]
*  So do I, says the cop. We all do. He looks at my friend thoughtfully and goes, drive safely, sir, [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3718.24s)]
*  and hands back his license and registration. No ticket. So in two days, he's saved from a tragic [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3722.96s)]
*  marriage to a girl who doesn't like Alp and a speeding ticket. All true. It's more than a [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3728.88s)]
*  nicotine marriage. In an age to 350 million, people are guessing there are about 350 million Alp [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3734.08s)]
*  stories. Email us yours. We want to know and read it on the air. Email tellall at alppouch.com. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3740.0s)]
*  Tell all at alppouch.com. Give us your Alp story. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3747.84s)]
*  So Russia, Putin, who's been in power 25 years has been consistent for the whole duration [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3757.2000000000003s)]
*  of his presidency in one demand, which is that NATO stop encroaching on his borders and specifically [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3761.76s)]
*  that Ukraine, which is the largest country, the borders Russia not be in NATO. And that is [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3768.2400000000002s)]
*  my understanding. My certainty is that that still remains the central demand period. No [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3774.64s)]
*  Ukraine and NATO can't have peace without that in the same way that Israel doesn't want Hamas [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3779.52s)]
*  and its border. They don't want that. I, what can, can the US deliver that? [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3785.52s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think the largest issue in that conflict are these so-called four regions, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3793.2799999999997s)]
*  Donbas, Crimea, you know, the names, Lugansk, and there's, there's two others. They're Russian [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3801.12s)]
*  speaking. There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3810.64s)]
*  that they want to be under Russian rule. I think that's the key issue in the conflict. So that's [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3816.3199999999997s)]
*  the first thing that when that gets settled and we're having very, very positive conversation. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3822.56s)]
*  Russia controls that. In fact, some of those territories are now from the Russian perspective, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3828.48s)]
*  part of Russia. Correct. That's correct. But this has always been the issue. Right. And it's, it's [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3832.64s)]
*  sort of no one wants to talk about it. That's the, that's the elephant in the room. The elephant in [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3838.0s)]
*  the room is there are constitutional issues within Ukraine as to what they can concede to with regard [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3842.08s)]
*  to giving up territory. The Russians are de facto in control of these territories. Yes. The question [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3850.0s)]
*  is, will they be, will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories? Will it end up, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3856.24s)]
*  can Zelensky survive politically if he acknowledges this? This is, this is, this is the central issue [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3864.3199999999997s)]
*  in the conflict. Absolutely that. On NATO, I think that Zelensky and he's got a right-hand guy, Yermak, [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3871.2s)]
*  I think that they've largely conceded that they are not going to be a member of NATO. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3880.3999999999996s)]
*  There's been all kinds of talk about whether they could still have quote unquote what, what is called [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3885.36s)]
*  Article Five protection. Right. Which gives every NATO country has this, this Article Five protection, [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3890.88s)]
*  whether Ukraine could have that in some respect from the United States or European nations without [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3898.8s)]
*  being a member of NATO. And I think that's open for discussion. But I think it's, it's accepted [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3904.96s)]
*  that Ukraine, if there's going, and Russia, if there's going to be a peace deal, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3910.96s)]
*  Ukraine cannot be a member of NATO. I think that's largely accepted. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3914.88s)]
*  So you spent sort of an amazing story. They got downplayed in the media, but you go to Moscow [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3919.2s)]
*  and then you wind up meeting directly with Putin for a long time. Long time. Which is [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3925.2s)]
*  kind of remarkable, I think, considering you're the president's envoy, but you're not. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3933.84s)]
*  I'm not the president. You're not the president. Exactly. Right. So the Russians are very formal, [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3939.2000000000003s)]
*  as you know, in every regard, they're very formal. And so you can imagine a scenario where it's like, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3944.0s)]
*  well, it's not the president. So our president's not going to meet with him, but he did meet with [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3948.64s)]
*  you for a long time. What did you think of him? I liked him. I thought he was straight up with me. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3952.0s)]
*  Of course, by the way, I've said that. And you can imagine, by the way, I say that I get pilloried. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3959.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh my gosh. You're actually saying that you like to die. Every American president, until Biden, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3964.4s)]
*  has said that. Every single one. Bill Clinton said that. George W. Bush said that. Barack Obama [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3969.28s)]
*  said that. Every president around the world I've ever spoken to is like, they may disagree with [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3974.32s)]
*  what Russia's doing or whatever, but they're like, yeah, Putin's a straightforward guy. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3978.08s)]
*  First of all, I thought it was gracious of him to accept me. Yeah. To see me. Why would I [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3981.2000000000003s)]
*  interpret it any other way? But that was gracious. Now, I'm an emissary of the president. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3989.36s)]
*  And the president had a great relationship with Vladimir Putin in his first term. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3994.4s)]
*  So I think Vladimir Putin knew that it was going to be hard for the president at this time to come [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=3999.12s)]
*  over to Russia. I think they're going to meet in the coming months. But I think it was enormously [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4004.0s)]
*  gracious for him to accept me. And I need to acknowledge that. It takes balls to say that. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4010.48s)]
*  I know. But by the way, that's the same way that I said that Sheikh Mohammed is a good guy. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4018.32s)]
*  Because that's not- Well, he is a good guy. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4024.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, in our country, if you don't act like a lemming and just walk off the cliff like [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4026.2400000000002s)]
*  everybody else, then you get attacked. By the way, how would we settle a conflict with a guy, [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4032.6400000000003s)]
*  with someone who is the head of a major nuclear power? Unless we establish trust and good feelings [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4041.52s)]
*  with one another. I don't know how you would do such a thing. And President Putin said to me in [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4049.6s)]
*  the first meeting I had, he said, Steve, do you know that I didn't talk to Joe Biden for three and [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4054.88s)]
*  a half years? It's craziness. How would you resolve that conflict? Tucker, can you imagine me and you [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4060.96s)]
*  having a conflict? I don't know what it was. You live in this house, I live in that house. Okay. I [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4066.0s)]
*  think you've encroached on my land and we never have a conversation about it. I mean, how do you [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4071.8399999999997s)]
*  resolve things in West York? That's why I went over there last year, because I thought we're moving [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4077.12s)]
*  toward a nuclear war. And I just feel like if no one's talking to Putin, like someone should at [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4079.44s)]
*  least broadcast his views to the world because we could have a war otherwise. That was my thinking [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4085.44s)]
*  anyway. When I came back after, before the first meeting with President Putin, when President Trump [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4090.88s)]
*  said to me, go over and have that conversation. I think we're going to have a good healthy [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4097.68s)]
*  conversation. Before that conversation, there was no talk about a Black Sea moratorium. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4101.68s)]
*  There was no conversation about an energy infrastructure moratorium on hits, you know, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4107.280000000001s)]
*  between the two countries. We were not talking about prisoner exchanges and all kinds of other [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4112.320000000001s)]
*  stuff. After one meeting, and I am saying to you, not because of me, because this was President Trump [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4117.12s)]
*  sending a signal to President Putin that he wanted to resume his relationship together and that they [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4124.08s)]
*  were going to be two great leaders figuring out this conflict. That was the message. That was me [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4129.76s)]
*  coming there. That was my message to President Putin. I was directed by President Trump to [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4136.96s)]
*  deliver that message, that we were here to begin a real discussion, a productive discussion about how [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4143.52s)]
*  to end this conflict. And President Putin, to his credit, sent all kinds of signals back to the [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4150.320000000001s)]
*  president that this is the path that he wanted to be on, including statements that he made. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4157.12s)]
*  In the second visit that I had, it got personal. President Putin had commissioned a beautiful [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4162.4s)]
*  portrait of President Trump from the leading Russian artist and actually gave it to me and [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4171.599999999999s)]
*  asked me to take it home to President Trump, which I brought home and delivered to him. It's been [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4176.88s)]
*  reported in the paper, but it was such a gracious moment and told me a story, Tucker, about how when [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4181.12s)]
*  the president was shot, he went to his local church and met with his priest and prayed for the [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4187.92s)]
*  president, not because he was the president of the United States, but because he had a friendship [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4194.64s)]
*  with him and he was praying for his friend. Can you imagine sitting there and listening to these [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4202.0s)]
*  kind of conversations and I came home and delivered that message to our president and [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4206.8s)]
*  delivered the painting and he was clearly touched by it. So this is the kind of connection that [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4212.4800000000005s)]
*  we've been able to reestablish through, by the way, a simple word called communication, which many [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4220.320000000001s)]
*  people would say, you know, I shouldn't have had because Putin is a bad guy. I don't regard Putin as [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4228.400000000001s)]
*  a bad guy. That is a complicated situation, that war and all the ingredients that led up to it. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4235.36s)]
*  You know, it's never just one person, right? So we're going to, I think we're going to figure [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4242.24s)]
*  it out. It's like a marriage. I mean, you know, you can blame the other person all you want, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4246.5599999999995s)]
*  but you're implicated in it too. So that's just a fact. That's just human nature. So it does raise [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4250.24s)]
*  the question. Everything you've said, I don't think any fair person, everything you've just said about [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4256.0s)]
*  Russia, Ukraine, any fair person with knowledge. Yeah, that's true. But why there has to be some [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4261.44s)]
*  reason that none of this has been acknowledged for three and a half years. Like why the effort [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4269.12s)]
*  to prevent Americans from hearing the other side, from understanding the conflict in its totality, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4273.12s)]
*  not just parts of it, but the whole thing. Like why, why the censorship designed to keep us from [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4277.919999999999s)]
*  knowing what's actually happening? Because that's what we've been enduring. Oh, I know. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4284.639999999999s)]
*  Censorship. Yes. We've been enduring a media that, you know, they all march together. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4288.8s)]
*  I mean, I told you the story. I give interviews about president Trump and I guess what, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4296.4800000000005s)]
*  all the nice things I have to say about him, because I believe in that, that sort of gets [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4301.76s)]
*  excised out of the, you know, out of my interviews, not with you, I know, but because you're a fan too. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4306.08s)]
*  I'm a great fan of his, you know, so you hear it. But guess what? Trump derangement syndrome still [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4313.2s)]
*  exists out there today. I don't, you know, he said it at the state of the union. If I came here, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4318.08s)]
*  and he was looking at the Democrats, if I came here, I had the cure for cancer and I could, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4324.48s)]
*  and I had a magic pill that would cure all conflicts all over the world. Nobody would cheer [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4329.2s)]
*  for me on your side. And it really, it really is true by the way. Look, look at how all the [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4333.92s)]
*  different things he's involved in now. I mean, we are out there curing and solving conflicts [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4339.92s)]
*  all over the world. It's unbelievable. And no one's ever seen this sort of progress before. And [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4345.52s)]
*  the Russians want to engage with us once again, because we have a real decision maker. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4351.68s)]
*  Iran is now responding to the letter. Hopefully we can solve that. Gaza, Turkey, it's, we've got real [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4356.160000000001s)]
*  leadership and the world needed leadership. And we were bereft of that leadership. We didn't have it. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4365.68s)]
*  And the Trump administration is, is moving forward with strong leadership. It's a big deal. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4372.24s)]
*  Do you think the Zelensky, the question of Zelensky, I think there's, there are good things [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4379.44s)]
*  to say about Zelensky. I think he's got a kind of bravery, which I admire. I think the Ukrainian [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4387.2s)]
*  military is legit brave, doomed because they're just fighting a much bigger country. You know, [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4391.44s)]
*  not going to win, but I think they've behaved with, with, you know, valiance. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4396.5599999999995s)]
*  But the Russian position is he's not elected. And so we can't sign any kind of treaty with him. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4403.44s)]
*  Do you think there will be elections in Ukraine? Yes, you do. There will be. Yeah, they've agreed [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4410.32s)]
*  to it. There will be elections in Ukraine. And I agree with you. I think Zelensky is trying his [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4415.04s)]
*  best. I think he's in a very, very difficult position, but he's up against the nuclear nation. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4421.92s)]
*  And he's also up against a nation that has four times the population that he has. And so he's [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4429.4400000000005s)]
*  got to know that they, that he's going to get ground down. Now is the best time for him to get [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4435.6s)]
*  a deal done. President Trump can deliver him the best possible deal he's ever going to get. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4440.96s)]
*  Who's giving him like the, I mean, you know, I blame Zelensky, the man for his behavior in [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4445.04s)]
*  Washington a few weeks ago, but I also blame whoever briefed him before he went into the Oval [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4450.72s)]
*  with the president and vice president, whoever told him to act that way. And it's clear people [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4456.08s)]
*  did, whether it was Samantha Power or whoever it was, those people, I mean, that was criminally bad [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4460.16s)]
*  advice. Do you think he's speaking to realistic, clear-eyed people who can, you know, who have the [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4466.320000000001s)]
*  welfare of Ukraine in mind? So without getting into names, I've talked to multiple European [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4473.6s)]
*  leaders and I've said to them, the more you encourage him not to be proactive at the peace [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4480.88s)]
*  table, the more you suggest that aid will continue without any conditions attached to it. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4489.2s)]
*  No one says that we shouldn't aid Ukraine today or in the, and in the reconstruction later on, but [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4497.52s)]
*  it's got to come with certain conditions. If we're going to give a lot of money to Ukraine, [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4504.96s)]
*  we want to hear the business plan of how this is going to get resolved because it's an unsustainable [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4510.96s)]
*  business plan if they don't have a plan for how it gets resolved. We just can't forever give money [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4516.72s)]
*  for, because they'll get ground down. And ultimately, and this is, you know, me and we've [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4524.16s)]
*  discussed this in the administration, ultimately, what you can have here is risk of any kind of [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4530.08s)]
*  nuclear action, even the tactical nuclear action. I mean, even if it's not a big bomb explosion, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4535.44s)]
*  it doesn't matter. Just a tactical nuke would take stock markets down all over the world. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4541.36s)]
*  They haven't been used in 80 years. They've been used exactly twice in human history. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4545.28s)]
*  It can't allow it to happen. It's not a precedent you want at all. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4548.88s)]
*  And while I think we have to get a fair deal for Ukraine, we cannot allow that country to drag us [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4552.72s)]
*  into World War III. And that's not what I'm, that's not my policy. That's President Trump's policy. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4559.6s)]
*  Then what is, if I can just say, like, what the hell is going on with European Union? Keir [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4565.52s)]
*  Starmor saying we're going to send British troops. Their entire military is smaller than the US Marine [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4570.400000000001s)]
*  Corps. The country is dying economically. All those countries are dying economically. Like, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4574.400000000001s)]
*  what are they thinking? What is that? Is that a posture? Is it a pose? [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4578.96s)]
*  Well, I think, I think it's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4582.320000000001s)]
*  being simplistic. I think there's this, you know, this sort of notion of we've all got to be like [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4588.4s)]
*  Winston Churchill. The Russians are going to march across Europe. I think that's preposterous, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4594.4s)]
*  by the way. We have something called NATO that we did not have in World War II. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4598.719999999999s)]
*  Do you think the Russians want to march across Europe? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4603.28s)]
*  A hundred percent not. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4605.12s)]
*  I think. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4606.16s)]
*  Right. I feel like why would they want that? I wouldn't want those countries. Like, why would they? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4606.96s)]
*  First of all, why would they want to absorb Ukraine? For what purpose? [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4612.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4615.28s)]
*  They don't need to absorb Ukraine. That would be, that would be like occupying Gaza. Why do [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4615.68s)]
*  the Israelis really want to occupy Gaza for the rest of their lives? They don't. They want stability [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4620.16s)]
*  there. They don't, they don't want to deal with that. But the Russians also have what they want. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4624.56s)]
*  They've gotten, they've reclaimed these five regions. They have Crimea and they've gotten [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4629.200000000001s)]
*  what they want. So why do they need more? He said Putin is a very smart guy. You know, someone said [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4634.8s)]
*  to me that someone, I was talking to someone in the administration and they said, well, you know, [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4639.360000000001s)]
*  you got to watch it because he's an ex KGB guy. So I said, okay, what's, what's the inference? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4644.56s)]
*  Well, he's an ex KGB guy. He could be looking to manipulate you. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4650.4800000000005s)]
*  Says the ex CIA guy to you. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4654.64s)]
*  This was not an ex CIA guy. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4657.92s)]
*  But effectively, and I said, look, here's, here's how I see it. In the old days, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4660.4800000000005s)]
*  the only people who went into the KGB were the smartest people in the nation. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4666.080000000001s)]
*  That's who went into the KGB. He's a super smart guy. Okay. You don't want to give him the credit [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4669.84s)]
*  for it. That's okay. I give him the credit. But he is, I know I'm very aware. So should we ignore it? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4675.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, and this, this is what I talk about with level setting the facts. Like, like are we now, [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4684.56s)]
*  like Trump was elected. We're now allowed to speak freely. We were not, you know, we were, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4690.16s)]
*  we were muzzled Tucker. No one was allowed to say what they really wanted to say. I'm very aware. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4694.72s)]
*  I mean, we just came out of a, of a world where a judge who was not even an elected judge could [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4699.36s)]
*  tell a man that he was going to spend 10 years in prison, you know, and he had 80 million votes in [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4704.4s)]
*  this country. Yes. What that's gone. Okay. So, you know, listen, we can breathe again. Yes. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4709.2s)]
*  That's amazing. So there is, okay. So there's the negotiation that's going on between Eastern [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4716.8s)]
*  Europe, between Russia and Ukraine, which you're obviously the center of, but there's also an [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4724.96s)]
*  informal negotiation going on back in Washington, where you have a lot of people with, you know, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4730.24s)]
*  economic interests in this war. I mean, let's just be honest, certainly ideological interests. And all [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4736.16s)]
*  of Washington has been mobilized to fight Russia. We are at war with Russia through our proxy Ukraine. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4743.2s)]
*  The president Trump shows up and is like, oh, you know, applies the brakes, like it stands on the [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4749.2s)]
*  brakes. But is that going to get resolved? I think so. You do. I think so. Yeah. It's one [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4753.36s)]
*  thing to deal with the Russians, but to deal with the permanent bureaucracy, that's really tough. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4759.759999999999s)]
*  But who doesn't want to have a world where Russia and the United States are doing [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4763.839999999999s)]
*  collaboratively good things together? Exactly. Thinking about how to integrate their energy [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4770.08s)]
*  policies in the Arctic. Share sea lanes. Maybe send LNG gas into Europe together. Maybe collaborate [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4775.76s)]
*  on AI together if we can get past, you know, technology migration. Who doesn't want to see [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4786.320000000001s)]
*  a world like that? What about the presidents being able to talk to one another about Iran, [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4792.64s)]
*  where Russia has some degree of influence? I mean, who doesn't want to see a world like that? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4799.4400000000005s)]
*  To me, it's so logical. I passionately want to see a world like that. Not for any weird agenda, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4803.84s)]
*  other than that sounds great. Like, why wouldn't you want that? Exactly. But nobody wants that in [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4808.64s)]
*  Washington. Well, I think this is the thing. People get wedded, you know, to a prescription [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4812.96s)]
*  because that was what they endorsed before and it's hard for them to back off of it. Yes, it is. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4818.08s)]
*  But you seem confident that the entire permanent establishment in DC, and they're not all stupid, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4824.0s)]
*  by the way, some of them are very smart and highly motivated, they can be brought around [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4829.76s)]
*  to that view. Well, look at the progress that we've made in Russia. We've made tremendous [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4833.44s)]
*  progress. It's nothing short of enormous. How in the world is that Putin looking to manipulate [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4839.44s)]
*  people like me or other people who may be negotiating with him? That's Putin actually [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4846.08s)]
*  reaching across the table and saying to President Trump, I'm prepared to do these things. And now [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4852.08s)]
*  the president is accepting that and he's saying, let me tell you what I'm prepared to do. And he's [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4857.599999999999s)]
*  prepared to bring Zelensky into the conversation and he talks to Macron and he talks to Stammer [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4862.88s)]
*  and he talks to the Norwegians and the Finnish. I think none of these people have been talking [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4868.32s)]
*  together before. Can you imagine a war that's been going on for three and a half years? No one was [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4873.84s)]
*  talking. This is what went on. It's insanity. I know. And by the way, it was inexorably marching [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4878.64s)]
*  toward nuclear conflict. Had to be. Had to be. That's exactly right. Or the Russians would have [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4884.400000000001s)]
*  just ground them down conventionally. Either way is a bad outcome for Ukraine. That makes no sense [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4890.32s)]
*  either. The Russians outstripped them four to one in population. They either would have ground them [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4895.92s)]
*  down over time or God forbid you could have had some kind of tactical nuclear issue. Yes. Which [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4901.5199999999995s)]
*  would have been a disaster for the world. Because as you say, we haven't had one for 80 years. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4909.2s)]
*  It's so, I can't tell you, I'm not sucking up. I mean this. I can't tell you how refreshing it is [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4914.639999999999s)]
*  to see someone hear someone tell the truth, obvious truths. And I do think it makes a huge [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4919.52s)]
*  difference to say the truth out loud. Well, I think it's important to say the truth out loud. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4924.240000000001s)]
*  That's what we weren't allowed to say. Yeah. When I went to court with the president, I went to his [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4929.6s)]
*  criminal trial quite often. I would walk out of the criminal trial. You would see all the [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4936.400000000001s)]
*  reporters from MSNBC, CNN sort of like glaring at me, Tucker. Almost as if to say, why would you [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4942.88s)]
*  come here? I mean, can you just imagine? We were living in a society of you're innocent until proven [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4950.24s)]
*  guilty, but the president had been convicted already. Well, you know what? That wasn't good [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4956.88s)]
*  enough for me. I spoke about the president, how I felt about him, my friendship with him, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4962.56s)]
*  how I thought that trial was unfair. I testified for him in the AG trial. I led an amicus curie [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4968.72s)]
*  brief. Nobody was doing it in those days. Everybody was afraid. I just think we need to level set the [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4975.76s)]
*  facts and understand what the true conditions are out there. The true conditions in Russia [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4982.400000000001s)]
*  is that it's complicated and Ukraine. It's a complicated conflict. They've been at each other [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4988.96s)]
*  since World War II. There's a sensibility in Russia that Ukraine is a false country, [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=4994.56s)]
*  that they just patch together in this sort of mosaic, these regions. That's the root cause, [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5000.72s)]
*  in my opinion, of this war, that Russia regards those five regions as rightfully theirs since [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5009.84s)]
*  World War II. That's something that nobody wants to talk about. Well, I say it out loud. How are [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5015.92s)]
*  we going to solve this thing unless we solve the central issue that depends on the conflict? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5020.96s)]
*  That Khrushchev kind of just made those part of Ukraine. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5026.24s)]
*  Correct. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5029.04s)]
*  Yeah. I think Khrushchev was Ukrainian. Amazing. I just have to ask you this. You were with [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5029.52s)]
*  then candidate Trump at the trials, then you were on the road with him. I saw you [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5039.84s)]
*  traveling with him everywhere during the campaign. You're a very old friend of his. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5043.68s)]
*  And he trusts in you. He also likes you. So at that point, you can kind of have any job [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5048.4s)]
*  you want. That's the way it works. But you didn't want any job. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5053.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, it would be arrogant for me to say that I could have any job I wanted. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5058.96s)]
*  Okay. But you're better positioned than anyone else I'm aware of to get a job at the administration, [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5063.68s)]
*  but you weren't there scrambling to get one. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5068.88s)]
*  Well, I wanted if I, you know, the president, there's a lot of people who did good things [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5070.64s)]
*  for him during the campaign, but that doesn't necessarily mean that doing those good things [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5077.6s)]
*  transfers over to you being able to be a part of an administration and govern. So I never wanted [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5082.72s)]
*  to presume that I could have any job that I wanted. I think that would almost be disrespectful to my [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5088.56s)]
*  friendship. That's my outside assessment. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5094.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. Listen, I know you're a very good friend of the president's too. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5095.76s)]
*  So you understand. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5100.4800000000005s)]
*  You didn't seem anxious to be secretary of whatever. I guess that's my point. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5101.2s)]
*  No, I didn't want to do those jobs. Actually, I wanted to do something that felt worthy to me, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5104.96s)]
*  that felt like I was going to help either save lives, solve a crisis. I talked to Jared [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5110.96s)]
*  at great length, you know, about what it was like for him to work in the Mideast. I just began to [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5117.68s)]
*  feel that that would be something very worthy for me to do. Now I underestimated the complications [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5122.4s)]
*  in the job. That's for sure. I think I was a little bit quixotic in the way that I thought about it. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5130.48s)]
*  I'm going to roll in there on a white horse and no, it was anything but that, you know, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5138.96s)]
*  but I'm so glad he gave me this opportunity. I think I tell him, I think he sort of like, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5144.24s)]
*  he gets embarrassed when I tell him this, Tucker. I say to him all the time, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5150.96s)]
*  you blessed me when you gave me this job. He did. I think he blessed me. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5154.88s)]
*  I get to feel like my life has consequence now. It's, I get to do things [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5159.2s)]
*  on behalf of other people, something bigger than just doing something on behalf of myself. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5165.2s)]
*  So it's really a big deal. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5170.4800000000005s)]
*  Not many people get that chance over 60. That's pretty unusual. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5171.52s)]
*  I don't know if many people get that chance at all. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5175.12s)]
*  No, you're right. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5177.28s)]
*  And I'm so lucky, you know, so before the end of my life to be able to do this, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5178.48s)]
*  I'm so grateful to him. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5182.639999999999s)]
*  So one last question, area, which is Iran, which unfortunately I sidetracked around it, [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5184.879999999999s)]
*  but you said when I asked what is the government of Israel's plan for the region, [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5191.04s)]
*  what are the borders it hopes to solidify at some point, like what are the boundaries of the country, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5196.4s)]
*  et cetera, et cetera. You said your first response was it's, we need to solve for Iran. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5200.5599999999995s)]
*  That's the issue that overhangs everything. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5207.360000000001s)]
*  There's enormous pressure on the US, on the Trump administration from within and from outside [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5210.56s)]
*  to have a military conflict with Iran. I know that. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5217.6s)]
*  The president seemed, that's not his first, this is my read, if he wanted that, [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5222.88s)]
*  we'd already have it. He seems to want a diplomatic solution first. He wants to try that first. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5228.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5234.0s)]
*  That's fair? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5234.96s)]
*  That's fair. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5235.68s)]
*  Do you think that that's achievable? [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5236.96s)]
*  Yes, I do. I do. Look, he sent a letter to the Iranians. Usually it would be the Iranians [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5240.56s)]
*  sending a letter to him. Remember the Iranians air defenses have been eviscerated in that attack [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5250.24s)]
*  from Israel. They're open to attack today. Yeah. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5255.76s)]
*  Yeah. There are small country compared to ours. We could, I think we would, if we used [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5260.719999999999s)]
*  overwhelming force, it would be very, very bad for them. And so you wouldn't, and this is not [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5268.32s)]
*  a threat. I'm not threatening. That's, so if the Iranians ever listen to this broadcast, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5272.96s)]
*  this is not me issuing a threat. It's the president who has that authority. He would issue. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5277.759999999999s)]
*  But you're describing the reality as you understand it. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5282.0s)]
*  Correct. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5284.5599999999995s)]
*  So under those circumstances, it would be natural for the Iranians to reach out to the president to [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5286.02s)]
*  say, I want to diplomatically solve this. Instead, it's him doing that. Now I can tell you that he's [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5291.620000000001s)]
*  not reaching out because he's weak, because he is not a weak man. He is a strong man, maybe one of [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5298.34s)]
*  the strongest men I've ever met in my life. Maybe the strongest man I've ever met in my life. Actually, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5303.780000000001s)]
*  I think at that point, I think he is that person. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5308.580000000001s)]
*  Whatever you think of Donald Trump, even Trump haters would have to acknowledge that's kind of [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5311.06s)]
*  indisputable at this point. Yeah. He's, he is a strong man. And I'm going to say this, the [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5314.58s)]
*  strongest man I've ever met. So with that all said, he wrote that letter. And why did he write that [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5319.46s)]
*  letter? For people who aren't aware of that, can you roughly describe what it said? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5326.18s)]
*  It roughly said, I'm a president of peace. That's what I want. There's no reason for us to [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5330.74s)]
*  do this militarily. We should talk. We should get, we should clear up the misconceptions. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5339.3s)]
*  We should create a verification program so that nobody worries about weaponization of your nuclear [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5345.38s)]
*  material. And I'd like to get us to that place because the alternative is not a very good [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5353.14s)]
*  alternative. It's that's a rough encapsulation of what was said roughly. And the president has said [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5358.66s)]
*  that he's, he's, he's said that. So I'm not telling you anything's top secret or anything of that [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5365.54s)]
*  sort. The Iranians have reached back out and I'm not at liberty to talk about the specifics, but [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5370.42s)]
*  clearly through a, you know, back channels through multiple countries and multiple conduits, they've [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5378.34s)]
*  reached back out. I think that it has a real possibility of being solved diplomatically, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5382.82s)]
*  not because I've talked to anybody in Iran, but just because I think logically it makes sense [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5388.9s)]
*  that it ought to be solved diplomatically. It should be. I think the president has acknowledged [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5393.22s)]
*  that Iran, that he's open to an opportunity to clean it all up with Iran, where they come back [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5398.34s)]
*  to the world and be a great nation once again and not have to be sanctioned and being, and being able [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5405.780000000001s)]
*  to grow their economy, their economy. I mean, these are very smart people. Their economy was once, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5415.860000000001s)]
*  was once a wonderful economy. It's, they're being strangled and suffocated today. There's no need [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5421.22s)]
*  for that to happen. They can join the league of nations and we can have a better relationship and [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5426.0199999999995s)]
*  grow that relationship. And that's what he's presenting. That's the alternative he's presenting. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5431.3s)]
*  I think he wants to deal with Iran with respect. He wants to build trust with them, if it's possible. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5436.82s)]
*  And that's his directive to his administration. And I, and hopefully that will be met positively [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5444.820000000001s)]
*  by the Iranians. I'm certainly hopeful for it. I think anything can be solved with dialogue [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5451.700000000001s)]
*  by clearing up misconception and miscommunication and disconnects between people. I believe that, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5458.820000000001s)]
*  by the way. And yet, and the president is a president who doesn't want to go to war [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5463.620000000001s)]
*  and he'll use military action to stop a war. That's when he actually wants to use military [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5470.26s)]
*  action. In this particular case, hopefully it won't be necessary. Hopefully we can, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5475.38s)]
*  we can do it at the negotiating table. I hope for our sake you wind up in Tehran. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5480.0199999999995s)]
*  I hope I do too, or someone, or someone else from the administration. This is a little bit [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5485.54s)]
*  more complicated this one because it's nuclear and we're going to need some real technical, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5491.0599999999995s)]
*  it's just a little bit more complicated. But I think it'll begin with, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5495.86s)]
*  it'll begin with the president, with someone from the president's team. It could be me, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5501.46s)]
*  it could be me and other people. It could not be me and somebody else. But I am going to welcome [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5507.62s)]
*  that opportunity if I'm involved. Amazing. Steve Wirtkopf, Godspeed. Thank you. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5515.54s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. Thanks for having me. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5521.94s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. On one level, that's not surprising, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5527.62s)]
*  that's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking. With everything that's going on in the [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5532.5s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5536.259999999999s)]
*  one the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5541.379999999999s)]
*  rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5546.58s)]
*  we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5553.3s)]
*  way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5556.98s)]
*  deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5561.78s)]
*  hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5567.14s)]
*  a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acvu2LBumGo&t=5572.34s)]
