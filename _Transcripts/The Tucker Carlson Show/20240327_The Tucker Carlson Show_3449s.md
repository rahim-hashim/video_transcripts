# “We Were Used,” Gold Star Father Reveals the Biden Administration’s Shameful Behavior
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok)
*  By August of 2021, Kabul, Afghanistan looked a lot like, well, Saigon, Vietnam looked in April of 1975. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=0.0s)]
*  Chaotic, dangerous, and humiliating to the United States. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=8.64s)]
*  After 20 years in Afghanistan, the Biden administration had just pulled American troops out. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=13.16s)]
*  The city immediately fell to the Taliban. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=18.36s)]
*  The president got on a private plane with millions of American dollars and ran away like a coward he is. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=20.16s)]
*  And thousands of Afghan civilians were rushing to Hamid Karzai Airport in a desperate attempt to flee the country, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=26.119999999999997s)]
*  sort of like those helicopters taking off from the roof of the embassy in 1975. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=32.4s)]
*  So U.S. service members were deployed to the scene to help keep the peace, but it was an impossible task. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=37.0s)]
*  Mobs of Afghans running on the runway, trying to board flights, some clinging to the landing gear. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=43.04s)]
*  You remember the pictures. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=48.76s)]
*  And in the middle of that scene, that total chaos created by the Biden administration, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  a suicide bomber arrived carrying 20 pounds of explosives. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=55.04s)]
*  It made its way to a place called the Abbey Gate, the entrance to the airport, and then detonated the device. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=58.8s)]
*  And in so doing, murdered 13 American service members, along with 170 Afghans, men, women and children. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=64.0s)]
*  One of the Americans murdered that day was a Marine Lance Corporal called Kareem Nkoui. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=72.4s)]
*  He was just 20, 20 years old. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=77.24s)]
*  He is now credited with saving the lives of at least three Afghan families and help getting them out of that country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=79.56s)]
*  Fast forward to 2024, and Joe Biden is hoping, as he stands for reelection at the advanced stage of 81, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=86.72s)]
*  you've completely forgotten what he did in Afghanistan and the humiliating and deadly way he withdrew American forces from that country. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=92.72s)]
*  But not everyone has forgotten. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  In fact, those touched by the tragedy of that day in the preceding 20 years will never forget. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=103.6s)]
*  Now, if you watched Biden's State of the Union address earlier this month, you heard a man in the audience yell out to Biden, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=108.44s)]
*  reminding him of the killings that took place at the Abbey Gate at the airport in Kabul. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=115.32s)]
*  Here's that scene. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=120.92s)]
*  All Americans deserve the freedom to be safe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=122.2s)]
*  And America is safer today than when I took office. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=126.68s)]
*  Year before I took office, murder rates went up 30 percent. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=130.24s)]
*  30 percent they went up. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=133.92s)]
*  The biggest increase in history. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=139.12s)]
*  But the soulless monster keeps talking. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=142.8s)]
*  That would be Joe Biden, the soulless monster. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=144.92s)]
*  The man you heard screaming has a soul and he has a reason for sadness and outrage. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=147.64s)]
*  He is called Steve Nekuhi. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=153.6s)]
*  He is the father of that murdered Lance Corporal Kareem Nekuhi killed in the bombing at Abbey Gate. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=155.2s)]
*  So for saying that out loud, for trying to remind Joe Biden of what he did, Steve Nekuhi was arrested at the Capitol earlier this month. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=160.6s)]
*  He now joins us in the studio. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=168.2s)]
*  Mr. Kuhi, thank you very much for coming on. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=170.0s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=172.24s)]
*  So let's just start with the clip we just played. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=173.35999999999999s)]
*  Why did you yell out Abbey Gate and your son's name at the president? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=176.6s)]
*  OK, so, yeah, we had an opportunity to go to the State of the Union this time. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=179.96s)]
*  Two families were invited by Mike Johnson. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=187.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=191.4s)]
*  And so those families were picked by a hat. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  So there's a coalition of families, which is six of us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=195.6s)]
*  And we can get in later why we had to start a coalition. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=201.6s)]
*  So we all signed a contract and, you know, are fighting for. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=205.68s)]
*  To get the information of the withdrawal out, but to to there were two tickets and we drew hat, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=212.68s)]
*  we drew names for those and and these are the ones that are going. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=220.76s)]
*  And so there was a chance that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=224.96s)]
*  They might address, he might address and finally say the kids' names, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=229.44s)]
*  because the thing is, he's never he's never recognized the kids as names. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=234.72s)]
*  He's never accepted any kind of responsibility for the withdrawal. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  Biden Biden has never said your son's name. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=243.4s)]
*  Never, never, not once. None of the kids. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=245.32s)]
*  And so we were hoping that, all right, well, these two family members, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=248.56s)]
*  you know, they're going to be able to go and he might, you know, bring up Afghanistan and. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=252.44s)]
*  Say their names now for me, I had never done any interviews. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=259.08s)]
*  The only interview that I really did was an interview I'd done with you at the very beginning. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=263.6s)]
*  And after his first state of the union, for whatever reason, I was at work and I got a call from some some young man. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=268.36s)]
*  Hey, look, we're trying to fill in a spot in our in our. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=278.56s)]
*  News thing at two o'clock or whatever time was, would you come on? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=284.2s)]
*  And I'm like, well, I don't do interviews. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  Oh, well, look, I need to have someone please. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=289.79999999999995s)]
*  And he kept begging and was persistent. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=292.24s)]
*  And he was all, you know, we want to ask you about Joe Biden and the state of the union. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=294.08s)]
*  Now, this is the first one that he had done after the withdrawal. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=297.15999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, well, I didn't even watch it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=300.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean, I don't do interviews and. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=302.15999999999997s)]
*  Somehow I. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=305.56s)]
*  Sorry, I just want to be totally clear. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=306.84000000000003s)]
*  So a year or the next year after your son was. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=308.48s)]
*  Yeah, so this is in January, probably of twenty twenty two. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=312.68s)]
*  But you'd never met President Biden or been to the White House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=315.92s)]
*  No. So we met him at Dover when we did the dignified transfer. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=319.64s)]
*  But that was anything but dignified. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=323.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, he. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=325.48s)]
*  It's kind of the same like if you have kids. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=331.12s)]
*  You have four. OK. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=333.8s)]
*  Like if I was drunk and then I killed your kid in a drunk driving accident [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=335.52000000000004s)]
*  and then I went to you and said, well, you know what? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=340.76s)]
*  I know how you feel. I lost my son. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=343.0s)]
*  And this is how he was at Dover. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=345.76s)]
*  So he talked about himself. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  He talked about his son. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=349.56s)]
*  So even in Dover, when we had first met, you know, when we had met him [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=351.08000000000004s)]
*  in the dignified transfer, he said, hey, look, you know, I [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=354.68s)]
*  I understand what you're going through. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=359.24s)]
*  We lost our son, Bo, as well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=360.6s)]
*  Now, in there, I wasn't I. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=363.92s)]
*  So people had a chance to whether or not they wanted to meet with the president. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=365.84s)]
*  And if some people didn't want to meet with them, they could go to another room. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=369.52s)]
*  I wasn't going to be bullied and go to another room. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=373.03999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, I turned my back to him. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=375.32s)]
*  So when he walked in, I turned my back to him. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=377.96s)]
*  My. Sorry. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=380.59999999999997s)]
*  It's all right. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=384.44s)]
*  My daughter came. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=385.52s)]
*  It stood next to me. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=387.64s)]
*  So we just turned our back to her. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=389.76s)]
*  And then Kareem's mom was talking to him. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=391.44s)]
*  So I was listening to what she was saying. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=394.88s)]
*  And that, you know, that's what he had said. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=397.4s)]
*  Like, you know, I understand your loss. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=399.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, we lost a son. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=401.23999999999995s)]
*  And that just, you know, infuriated her even more. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=403.2s)]
*  But he was like this with everyone and then. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  Everything up in and since we're on that point, I mean, we were we were used. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=413.08s)]
*  That whole thing was us being used. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=419.44s)]
*  I mean, we were, you know, I wanted to wear a suit when I went to this dignified [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=420.96s)]
*  transfer for my son. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=424.88s)]
*  And I don't know if you remember in like the 70, those yellow school buses [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=426.32s)]
*  that had the like Tijuana tuck and roll. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=430.08s)]
*  You know, you're going up and down. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=433.03999999999996s)]
*  There's no shocks. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=434.52s)]
*  You can't put down the windows. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's in Dover, which is like the most humid place you've ever been in your life. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  They transferred us in these like buses, like all the families. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=443.0s)]
*  They put us up in a motel six. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=447.12s)]
*  Had fecal matter on the walls, had cockroaches everywhere. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=449.52s)]
*  All right. Now we all got into these buses and we're all sweating. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=454.76s)]
*  They drove us to Dover. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=458.52s)]
*  The place that they do this at Dover, the message is really clear. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=460.52s)]
*  Like they don't care at all. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=463.56s)]
*  Yeah. But at the time, we didn't I didn't realize that, you know, at the time, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=464.84s)]
*  I think, well, you know, I'm doing this for my country. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=468.12s)]
*  You know, I mean, I felt like almost obligated that I had to do this. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=471.47999999999996s)]
*  Yes. You know, and like here this is. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=476.68s)]
*  But like, oh, they're honoring us like a stateside honoring when when in retrospect, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  you know, it was just trying to show like, oh, we're honoring these parents. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=484.92s)]
*  And that's the end of it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=488.71999999999997s)]
*  Do you kind of understand what you're saying? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=490.44s)]
*  It's like the optics like here, look what we're doing. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=491.96s)]
*  And it was it was very this is the first time I'd seen all the other parents. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=494.8s)]
*  And remind you, this is two days after it happened. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=500.08s)]
*  So the next day after this all happens, you don't have time to grieve. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=502.52s)]
*  You have the military telling you you have to sign these papers. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=505.84000000000003s)]
*  We got to go over here to Dover, Delaware. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=509.2s)]
*  And I'm like, what's in Dover, Delaware? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  I have no idea what they're talking to any of this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=514.44s)]
*  I have to Google everything. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=516.64s)]
*  I have to research what a dignified transfer is. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=517.88s)]
*  You know, I'm I have no idea. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=520.44s)]
*  And they're telling you, you know, you just lost your kid. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=522.84s)]
*  Now they're saying you have to go to Delaware and and et cetera, et cetera. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=524.6800000000001s)]
*  So when we go over there, it's already. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=529.08s)]
*  And what I noticed, the first thing that I noticed when I went there, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=532.08s)]
*  um. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=536.8s)]
*  From being like a boss or a business owner, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=538.88s)]
*  I was able to see a different perspective is that they had no. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=541.9599999999999s)]
*  They didn't really know what they were doing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=549.0s)]
*  They were reacting to how we were to react. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=550.56s)]
*  And I found that to be shocking. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=553.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, it's like, whoa, what is going on here? [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=555.12s)]
*  Like, there's no protocol. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=558.0799999999999s)]
*  They're seeing how we would react if we'd get physical, if we'd get violent, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=561.56s)]
*  if we'd yell, you understand what I'm saying? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=564.92s)]
*  It could there was that, you know, there was a lot of people. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=568.36s)]
*  I was yelling, I was yelling at the general, you know, and and I was upset. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=570.92s)]
*  What did you say to the general? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=575.52s)]
*  So I he was pretty much the only one that I that I yelled at. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=578.24s)]
*  And I just said, you know, you should have been planning this evacuation. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=582.68s)]
*  You know, you should have taken time, you know, at the time, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=586.8399999999999s)]
*  I just remember him promoting his book and then some of the stuff [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=589.16s)]
*  that had happened with his counterpart was, you know, at the beginning of the. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=592.24s)]
*  Remember the name of the general? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=596.96s)]
*  Yeah, General Miley, Milly. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=599.0s)]
*  And I just met him last week and he remembered that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=602.32s)]
*  He remembered that altercation that we had. And, you know, I spotted him [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=605.4s)]
*  in one of the other rooms and that Dover, Delaware. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=612.92s)]
*  Let me let me. So you said to clear up exactly what happened. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=615.16s)]
*  So you see Milly at Dover and you and two days before your son was killed. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=618.64s)]
*  And you say to him, you should have. No, after two days after. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=623.72s)]
*  So this all happened after. Right. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=626.4399999999999s)]
*  But two days before when you first met him, your son had just been killed. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=628.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. That's right. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=632.04s)]
*  So you say to him, effectively, this is your fault. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=633.08s)]
*  Like you're in charge of this. Right. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=636.16s)]
*  Didn't do a good job. What did he say? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=637.28s)]
*  He said, I had been planning for this. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=639.04s)]
*  You know, we did plan for it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=641.92s)]
*  You know, it was a mistake. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=643.92s)]
*  I don't even I don't know if he said a mistake, but he had said that. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=649.12s)]
*  And I kept telling him, well, you know, you don't care. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=653.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, I mean, you weren't looking like you were planning for it [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  from what I seen from January until now. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=660.36s)]
*  It looked like you were doing everything else. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=665.12s)]
*  You know, it looked like you were on a book tour and it looked like you were [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=667.4s)]
*  coercing with, you know, the Chinese government. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=671.1600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, he said, I think he said, I've lost 47 men. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=674.44s)]
*  Or 67 men, one of the two. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=681.72s)]
*  And then I said, I lost my son. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=683.6400000000001s)]
*  And so you can for him and he made it about himself, just like Joe Biden. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=685.72s)]
*  I've suffered, too, is what he said. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=689.36s)]
*  You know what? Now that I've known more about like the military and people, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=691.4000000000001s)]
*  you know, I wouldn't say so with him. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=695.84s)]
*  I would say, you know, what I've noticed with people in the military, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=700.6s)]
*  and I just realized this in the last month, is that they look at us like. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=703.68s)]
*  Sorry. So people that have served, it appears that they they treat us [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=711.96s)]
*  like they would want their folks treated if they had lost their lives. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=716.24s)]
*  Good. You understand what I'm saying? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=720.88s)]
*  Good. I do. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=722.12s)]
*  And now in retrospect, you know, his anger, I think, was more along the lines of. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=723.28s)]
*  His guilt. I feel he really felt guilty, you know, and he didn't. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=729.5600000000001s)]
*  And he's just mad, you know, he's a he's in and and and what I told him [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=735.6s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago is because I had an immense respect for him. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=739.44s)]
*  To me, he was the guy, you know, he was the face of our military. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=742.88s)]
*  Yes. And more than that, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=748.16s)]
*  more so than pretty much anywhere else. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, you know who Mark Milley is. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=754.64s)]
*  I mean, he's he's a dominating force at the, you know, prior to that. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=757.3599999999999s)]
*  Even Donald Trump had had him. So. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=763.56s)]
*  And I think, you know, that rage was that was that here. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=769.8s)]
*  He found himself in a position that, you know, this stuff happened. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=772.76s)]
*  And I feel like he felt some guilt. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=777.1999999999999s)]
*  Good. Honest with you at that time. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  Seems like an appropriate emotion. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=781.44s)]
*  Yeah. But at the time, I didn't I didn't I didn't think that it's taken [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=782.84s)]
*  several years and me to understand the military. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=787.24s)]
*  And that's that's I believe. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=790.2s)]
*  What what he was feeling is that he was [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=794.08s)]
*  he was upset with how everything happened. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=798.72s)]
*  And he wanted to convey that, look, you know, I love you. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=802.36s)]
*  And I've lost people, too. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=806.0400000000001s)]
*  And I know what you're going through. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=808.24s)]
*  You know, and so that was that was that. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=809.96s)]
*  Between the time you spent in Dover, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=813.6s)]
*  receiving your son's remains, staying in the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=816.64s)]
*  Motel 6 with human feces on the wall, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=821.08s)]
*  between that and this state of the union earlier this month, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=823.64s)]
*  had you had any contact with Biden or the White House? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=827.76s)]
*  Never. We've never had any contact with the White House or Biden. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=830.84s)]
*  And we have reached out or McCall [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=834.5600000000001s)]
*  and several people, several families have reached out [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=838.28s)]
*  to, you know, maybe have a roundtable with them, see what they're [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=841.92s)]
*  what they're thinking was anything, you know, honor us or not honor us, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=845.9599999999999s)]
*  honor our children. Yes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=850.68s)]
*  Something. And they just refuse. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=853.1999999999999s)]
*  I don't know why they hate us so much, to be honest with you. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=854.68s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=857.6s)]
*  I mean, because you're a living reminder of their failure. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=859.56s)]
*  But but in America, we're supposed to, you know, address those failures. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=863.24s)]
*  I mean, he had an opportunity that he could have really rallied [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=867.72s)]
*  the country behind him. Yes. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=870.6800000000001s)]
*  Very easily, you know, by by assuming any kind of responsibility. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=874.52s)]
*  Hell, you know, I know people that business owners that [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=878.36s)]
*  assume more responsibility for someone that gets hurt on their job [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=882.48s)]
*  than than what he's done for for these people, people that are held [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=885.5600000000001s)]
*  more accountable in drunk driving cases. Yes. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=889.36s)]
*  And man, yeah, after three years, this guy, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=893.76s)]
*  he just doesn't want to say anything about any of these kids. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=897.6s)]
*  So how much contact have you had with the families of the other servicemen killed? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=900.6800000000001s)]
*  The 12 other families? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=904.48s)]
*  So, yeah, there's well, since we've started [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=907.64s)]
*  trying to lobby to get answers, which was started last June. Yeah. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  The six families we talk every week [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=917.28s)]
*  and on in the capacity that we do for getting these answers. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=920.2s)]
*  Do you think they have the same feelings that you do? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=924.0s)]
*  Well, I can't. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=927.6s)]
*  I would say on some things, yeah, as regard to Milley, I couldn't. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=928.76s)]
*  I couldn't. What about the Biden administration? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=935.2s)]
*  100 percent were reunited on that. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=936.72s)]
*  And so you said at the outset that you wanted more information about [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=939.64s)]
*  what happened, right? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=942.6800000000001s)]
*  The events that led up to your son's death. Right. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  What what do you wish you knew, but don't. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=946.2s)]
*  OK, so we've made a lot of progress. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=949.28s)]
*  So what happened was when this all happened, we, you know, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=951.24s)]
*  we didn't have the House. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=954.96s)]
*  So any of the hearings, if you look at any of the the Senate [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=956.52s)]
*  hearings that were there, they were all kind of biased. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=959.5600000000001s)]
*  Like they all said, although this was great, you know, we did a good job. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=962.4s)]
*  Of course, we're going to. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=965.72s)]
*  It wasn't until [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=967.44s)]
*  McCarthy became speaker that we actually [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=970.6s)]
*  had an opportunity to to get the answers that we needed. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=974.36s)]
*  So last June, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=977.6s)]
*  we got an opportunity from Darrell Issa to do like a public. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=981.76s)]
*  We went, you know, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=985.96s)]
*  we went to Washington and the premise was like, look, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=988.24s)]
*  we don't know what's going to happen, but we're going to introduce you to McCarthy. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=991.04s)]
*  We're going to introduce you to Scalise McCall. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=995.08s)]
*  And we're going to get you to know because nobody knew our story. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=999.12s)]
*  Nobody, you know, it wasn't really out there. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1002.68s)]
*  Maybe it wasn't to some degree in like maybe social media or something, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1007.12s)]
*  because that's probably the only outlet that the parents had, [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  like their Facebook or whatever. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1015.64s)]
*  But there's a good portion of Americans that don't even pay attention to that. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1018.32s)]
*  So and I've been one of them. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1021.96s)]
*  I'm not on any of those that I could channel any anything. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1024.52s)]
*  And so when this opportunity came, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1029.64s)]
*  you know, they're like, look, we don't know what's going to happen. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1033.64s)]
*  We don't know if there's anything, but we're going to go down there. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1036.32s)]
*  And, you know, and every family of the 13 was was was. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1039.0s)]
*  Invited to this, like, here's what we're doing. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1044.6799999999998s)]
*  It said it was set up Sean Reyes from Utah [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1048.6799999999998s)]
*  and kind of connected us with these people. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1052.72s)]
*  And then it kind of from there went for Darrell Issa. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1056.28s)]
*  He was the one that, you know, had been champion everything at that point. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1059.24s)]
*  And so, you know, they they even had funding for it. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1063.68s)]
*  Like, we're going to take the mom and the dad of each [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1068.8400000000001s)]
*  each child, each service member, whoever wants to come. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1073.64s)]
*  And we're going to go down to Washington and see if there's any [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1077.6000000000001s)]
*  any anybody that's interested in anything. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1081.52s)]
*  So we went down there. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1083.6000000000001s)]
*  We met these different offices. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1085.76s)]
*  We told them our stories because nobody knew really our stories. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1089.3600000000001s)]
*  You know what had happened to us in Dover. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1094.16s)]
*  And then really, like the stuff that we were being told. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1096.48s)]
*  So they had given us a whole bunch of lies. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1099.76s)]
*  You know, we're we're people are talking to the kids. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1102.48s)]
*  People are talking to everyone that's coming back. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1105.3600000000001s)]
*  And what the government is telling us is different from what these [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1107.68s)]
*  people that were actually there are saying. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1111.28s)]
*  And so we're like, well, they're like, oh, there was no gunfire. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1114.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, one of the Marines actually killed one of his aggressors. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1117.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, he like shot him and killed him. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1122.32s)]
*  Or I don't know if he killed him. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1125.08s)]
*  So to say that there was no gunfire is absurd. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1126.72s)]
*  Now, my son, before I sent him. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1131.08s)]
*  Or before he went to Afghanistan, I bought him a when I was a kid, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1134.48s)]
*  when we were kids, there was that buck one ten knife that the Duke, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1139.32s)]
*  the Duke boys had that with the with the bolster on it. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1142.96s)]
*  So I bought my son one of those, but a switchblade. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1146.68s)]
*  And I said, you know, this is good for fast. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1149.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, if you need a knife, you know, you can it's a switchblade. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1153.52s)]
*  And I bought him this and he carried it on him. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1156.36s)]
*  I have pictures of him in Afghanistan with it. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1159.12s)]
*  Well, when the when the Kaco, which is the casually assisted coordinating officer. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1162.04s)]
*  So every time that something happens in the military to your loved ones, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  you get assigned a Kaco and he's basically the liaison [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1172.32s)]
*  between the military and your family. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1176.04s)]
*  I mean, everything from A to Z, you know, he's like your best friend. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1178.12s)]
*  And so when he had come that night to my house, I had said to him, hey, look, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1181.6s)]
*  you know, nothing else, I know nothing else I wanted [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1185.8s)]
*  except for that knife. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1190.56s)]
*  You know, I told him, hey, I gave my kid this knife and. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  I want that I want that back. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1197.72s)]
*  And, you know, he can't he didn't I just met him [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1200.6s)]
*  like two minutes ago and is, you know, he listened to me. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1204.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, on September 17th is when they brought my son his body back. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1208.4399999999998s)]
*  And so we, you know, it was a very nice, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1214.6799999999998s)]
*  another kind of dignified transfer from Ontario Airport to where we live in Norco. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1217.84s)]
*  He's buried like literally less than a mile from my house. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1223.4399999999998s)]
*  And that whole way, you know, the streets are lined [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1228.8799999999999s)]
*  American flags and people and everything. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1230.8799999999999s)]
*  And then when we get to the cemetery, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1232.6799999999998s)]
*  he pulls me in the back room and he and he pulls out that knife. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1235.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, in the case. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1239.36s)]
*  And I'm like, just happy for me. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1241.3999999999999s)]
*  It was like I put so much value in that knife, you know. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1243.44s)]
*  Like for some reason, I felt like if I had that knife, it would [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1248.72s)]
*  it would eliminate some of my pain that I had, you know, that that's something that we [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1253.1599999999999s)]
*  that we shared and I give it to him. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1258.96s)]
*  And when I when he handed me the knife, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1261.84s)]
*  I looked at it and there was a hole right in the front. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1264.6399999999999s)]
*  And the same the same case that we had when we were kids, you know, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1267.72s)]
*  it's a leather case with a little button says buck on it. Yeah. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1271.2s)]
*  And there's a hole in it. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1275.6s)]
*  I'm looking at it and I'm excited and I told him, hey, Charlie, there's a wow. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1276.6s)]
*  There's a hole from one of the babies, you know, because I.D. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1280.9199999999998s)]
*  little babies. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1284.84s)]
*  And I'm looking at it and I pull the knife out. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1286.1599999999999s)]
*  And the knife was like had imploded inside the sheath. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1290.32s)]
*  So it was hard to get it out of the sheath. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1294.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, it was hard. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1297.04s)]
*  The and when I pulled it out, my guy was like, he's a guy. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1298.9199999999998s)]
*  I think he got promoted. So don't don't be upset with me. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  But when I pulled it out, he's like, that's not a baby hole. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1307.9199999999998s)]
*  That's a bullet hole. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1312.76s)]
*  And so when I when I took it home, I got one of my five, five, six bullets. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1314.56s)]
*  And I got my dial calipers and I started measuring the depth of the hole [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1319.0800000000002s)]
*  and then put that depth in relation to the boat [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1324.44s)]
*  tail of the bullet and then measured the diameter. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1327.24s)]
*  I mean, I got real scientific and you could just pull the bullet right out [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1330.24s)]
*  of the five, five, six casing and put it fits perfect in there. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1333.5200000000002s)]
*  It was a five. It's a five, five, six. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1337.2800000000002s)]
*  And. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1340.48s)]
*  You know, that's that's proof. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1343.92s)]
*  And if it's on the front of his thing, it came from across. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1345.9199999999998s)]
*  It didn't come from behind. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1349.76s)]
*  It's not friendly fire because he didn't put it in his back. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1351.72s)]
*  It was right on his front. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1355.0s)]
*  They also they gave you pictures of like where your kid is. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1356.6799999999998s)]
*  Now every, you know, maps. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1360.12s)]
*  So when they gave you the the the briefing, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1362.24s)]
*  when they first briefed the families, they had maps and said, OK, your kid is here. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1366.1599999999999s)]
*  X marks the spot. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1371.32s)]
*  And then you'd ask him, well, who's this guy? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1372.32s)]
*  And they're well, we can't tell you. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1374.56s)]
*  But then after that, they told the public then these [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1376.32s)]
*  then now all of a sudden everybody is out there. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1379.32s)]
*  But the maps that they gave us were all different. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1381.48s)]
*  Like there's three of them. There's three. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  There's three different ones. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1385.8799999999999s)]
*  But one thing I can say and and and and the other families, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1387.28s)]
*  kids are in different locations in those three different maps. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1390.72s)]
*  But my son's always on that wall. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1394.44s)]
*  Like my son's always in every map right across from the bomber, like right across. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1397.6399999999999s)]
*  There's three kids on that wall and he was one of them. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1403.56s)]
*  So there's no he wasn't turned around. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1406.24s)]
*  There's no way it could have been friendly fire. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1409.52s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1411.56s)]
*  And that was like one of the things is like, well, here I've got proof. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1413.28s)]
*  You know, I've got proof that my kid was you're going to tell us that, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1416.52s)]
*  you know, they weren't shot at. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1420.24s)]
*  Everybody can hear it on the videos, but in here's physical proof that I have. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1423.0s)]
*  And it's not an AK round. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1427.36s)]
*  You know, it's not a it's not an AK size hole. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1429.6s)]
*  It's a perfect like literally that bullet was probably stuck in there [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1433.08s)]
*  and someone had to like pull it out like that's that's how it was. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1436.84s)]
*  And so fast forward to when we met [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1441.44s)]
*  their license and them in June, I brought that up and showed him that. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1446.2s)]
*  And these were some of the things that that they used to get the ball rolling, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1450.28s)]
*  to get interest in it. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1454.6799999999998s)]
*  So, you know, we've since June, we've been going to Congress [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1456.44s)]
*  for no other reason but to lobby for our kids, to give information [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1460.1200000000001s)]
*  that these congressmen don't have so they can bring in different people [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1464.04s)]
*  and do hearings and get the information that we need. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1469.28s)]
*  And we've made like enormous traction. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1472.76s)]
*  I mean, just the answers that we've gotten [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1476.16s)]
*  with the hearings that they have had have been. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1480.48s)]
*  Good that we have them, that we didn't, you know, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1483.8400000000001s)]
*  we didn't have them before, but as a testament to what a failure this was. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1485.96s)]
*  And we've pretty much gone in all avenues. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1491.04s)]
*  We've exhausted the military, I believe, at this point that, you know, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1493.88s)]
*  well, you know, they're the part that they were in charge of was a retrograde. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1498.56s)]
*  So there's two parts to it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1503.72s)]
*  There was a retrograde and then the evacuation. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1504.96s)]
*  And the retrograde went off unhitched. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1508.3600000000001s)]
*  You know, no problem. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1511.32s)]
*  The problem was, was that when you hear people say, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1512.6000000000001s)]
*  well, you should have taken the people out before you take out the military. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1515.56s)]
*  They should have done the Neo before they did the retrograde. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1519.4s)]
*  And that's where the point comes, is that the State Department [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1522.48s)]
*  and the administration was in charge of the Neo and the retrograde. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1525.36s)]
*  And the only reason why they did the Neo, now they did the Neo. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1529.64s)]
*  The Neo was implemented by Ross Wilson. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1532.68s)]
*  That's another guy. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1536.92s)]
*  He's he's the guy, you know, after all these nine months of going back and forth. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1538.32s)]
*  It's not, you know, I don't see it's the generals. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1544.12s)]
*  I don't see it's the military. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1546.08s)]
*  It's this guy. He's a guy that initiated the Neo and he did it on August 14th. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1548.12s)]
*  Now, who is Ross Wilson? [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1553.68s)]
*  And if you could just explain what a Neo is, I just I just I'm not. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1555.8s)]
*  He's the ambassador. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1559.84s)]
*  So he was the ambassador for Afghanistan. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1561.04s)]
*  That's about all I know about him. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1563.76s)]
*  We just we just kind of stumbled on to him a couple of weeks ago [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1565.6s)]
*  in that hearing that the two generals had. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1569.44s)]
*  A Neo is a noncombatant evacuation. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1572.48s)]
*  And those are, you know, planned by the State Department. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1576.44s)]
*  So every embassy has a Neo. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1580.96s)]
*  The problem that they did is they didn't implement the Neo soon enough. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1585.6s)]
*  So he implemented it on August 14th because the Taliban was [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1589.8s)]
*  he could see the Taliban coming. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1593.6s)]
*  So he sees him and he's oh, oh, I'm going to implement the Neo. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1595.28s)]
*  And then on the 15th, they come in and they take the embassy. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1599.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't remember if you remember those pictures very well where they're over there. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1602.64s)]
*  And that was all because the day before and even even the generals were kind of like, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1605.76s)]
*  well, and I said, no, you you guys did the Neo because you saw the Taliban right there. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1610.0800000000002s)]
*  It wasn't, you know, for any other reason that they were he was scared. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1614.2800000000002s)]
*  And that's why he did it. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1618.5600000000002s)]
*  And if it had been done months earlier, I mean, actually, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1620.4s)]
*  the whole thing should have been done at the beginning per the Doha agreement. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1624.64s)]
*  I mean, all the liberals say, oh, well, don't forget the Doha agreement. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1629.04s)]
*  It's so frustrating. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1633.56s)]
*  And I'm glad this last time we went to [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1634.72s)]
*  and we heard these Senate hearings with the two generals, you know, McCall, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1638.36s)]
*  McKenzie and Miley finally Meeks. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1644.96s)]
*  Because every time that guy is like, well, don't forget, you know, we we [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1649.24s)]
*  we appreciate the service and the sacrifice and not pointing them. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1653.8799999999999s)]
*  But don't forget who initiated the Doha agreement. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1657.56s)]
*  They always have to do that little jab. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1660.6s)]
*  And I'm here to tell you, I don't think anyone knows anything about Afghanistan [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1662.9199999999998s)]
*  better than any of these parents. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1666.44s)]
*  You're right. He should have followed the Doha agreement. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1668.1599999999999s)]
*  That would have been that we wouldn't have had this catastrophe. So. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1670.96s)]
*  You show up at the State of the Union a couple of weeks ago. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1675.56s)]
*  Do you plan to yell out your son's name? [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1679.0s)]
*  I wouldn't say really plan. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1683.12s)]
*  I, you know, we we got the opportunity that there were other tickets. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1685.76s)]
*  Other other members had given it to us. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1690.48s)]
*  And I wouldn't, you know, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1693.32s)]
*  I'm sure I had said this to people. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1697.16s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm going to say something if this guy doesn't say anything. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1698.8799999999999s)]
*  But when you're there in the greatest country of the world [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1702.6s)]
*  with the most powerful people, I was scared, like I was scared. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1706.12s)]
*  You know, am I going to get killed? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1710.56s)]
*  Am I going to commit suicide tomorrow because of this? [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1712.04s)]
*  You know, who knows? Right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1714.32s)]
*  And so, no, at that time, I was just in serious prayer. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1716.24s)]
*  You know, I was like praying to the Lord, you know, humble me, soften my heart, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1720.8s)]
*  you know, let your will be done, you know. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1723.9199999999998s)]
*  And to be honest with you, when I stood up, when I just heard him [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1727.0s)]
*  say something about kids, at some point he was talking about kids. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1730.2s)]
*  And then he said something about being safe. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1734.8s)]
*  And I just stood up and I didn't even I didn't even like the Holy Spirit [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1737.32s)]
*  like God in me and stood up. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1741.52s)]
*  And I don't know if you ever had anything like that happen, but like [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1743.4s)]
*  the effects of that had had [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1746.52s)]
*  affected me for weeks afterwards, you know, like what what really happened there. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1749.44s)]
*  And when I stood up and I said the first thing I said, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1754.48s)]
*  I kind of realized I had said it and I paused. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1757.6000000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, what did I do? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1760.0800000000002s)]
*  You know, and then I said, you know, United States Marines. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1762.44s)]
*  And I said his name and I said, you know, Second Battalion, First Marines. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1766.0s)]
*  But I don't even remember saying any of that. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1770.68s)]
*  Like, I don't even remember saying any of that. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1772.96s)]
*  You know, it just kind of came out. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  And if I could back up to why I had went earlier, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1776.92s)]
*  I was talking about that first state of the union. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1780.3600000000001s)]
*  And I got these reporters, you know, and I felt bad for him and I wanted help. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1783.24s)]
*  And I said, all right, well, look, what I'll do is my lunch break. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1786.5600000000002s)]
*  I got an hour lunch break on my lunch break. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1789.48s)]
*  I'm going to watch a state of the union [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1791.64s)]
*  so that I'll be able to answer appropriately for your interview [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1793.68s)]
*  that that you want me to do is all right. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1798.3200000000002s)]
*  So I watched his interview or I watched the state of the union, the first one. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1800.84s)]
*  And at like 56 minutes, he brings up Afghanistan. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1805.08s)]
*  And he did the exact same thing that he always does. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1809.6399999999999s)]
*  He says, OK, you know, we're never going to, you know, the the heroes that we [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1812.08s)]
*  didn't even say 13. And then one lady in the audience, she's like 13 of them. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1815.8s)]
*  I think it was Bobbitt or Bobbitt or yes. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1820.3999999999999s)]
*  And she said something now. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1823.28s)]
*  And I was I got goosebumps. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1824.76s)]
*  But he then did the same thing. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  He went right into Bo. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1830.36s)]
*  He ran right into a sign and he said the existential threat [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1831.9599999999998s)]
*  to the military is the burning of diesel fuel in pits. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1835.12s)]
*  Because that's, I think, how Bo got his cancer. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1840.8s)]
*  And I was just like crying. I was so devastated. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1843.3999999999999s)]
*  Like once I was for more than the fact that like when this happens, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1846.3999999999999s)]
*  like like I said, like all these cockroaches come out of the woodwork. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1852.6399999999999s)]
*  Like every media, you know, they want, you know, people. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1855.56s)]
*  I'm selling this. Oh, we love you. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1858.5600000000002s)]
*  And this I didn't get involved in any of it. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1860.52s)]
*  But I had seen that this was happening all over. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1862.68s)]
*  Yes. With a lot of people. And. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1866.3200000000002s)]
*  So so a part of me was upset that I had watched this. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1870.44s)]
*  All right. So I'm devastated. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1875.0s)]
*  I'm devastated, like like this, what this president had just done [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1877.24s)]
*  and how he had turned it again. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1881.0s)]
*  I mean, can't even say the kids his name. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1882.2800000000002s)]
*  If he would have said 13 names at that state of the union, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1884.0s)]
*  we wouldn't even be here right now. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1886.88s)]
*  All right. But he didn't. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1888.8s)]
*  And so I call this I call this. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1890.2s)]
*  I call this reporter guy back to tell him, you know, I'm like, I watch it. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1893.92s)]
*  I'm devastated. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1897.24s)]
*  Well, when I call him back, he's like, oh, hey, Mr. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1898.56s)]
*  Nakua, yeah, we're not going to do the interview because we got Mark Schmitz to do it. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1901.4s)]
*  And I was just like, wow, like in my heart, you know, here I watched. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1906.52s)]
*  I didn't want to do it. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1912.72s)]
*  I did it because I wanted to help him because he said, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1913.88s)]
*  we have to fill in a slot and none of the other parents can do it. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1916.04s)]
*  Then I agree to it. I watch this. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1920.52s)]
*  I get affected by it. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1922.92s)]
*  The only the only saving grace I have is like, all right, I'll get be able to vent [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1924.48s)]
*  something in this interview. Yes. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1928.76s)]
*  And then the guy's like, no, we're going to do it because we have one of the other parents. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1930.8s)]
*  And I was like crying even harder. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1934.68s)]
*  And and so I've had to deal with that for three years with, you know, my God, with my Lord [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1937.36s)]
*  praying, you know, like, hey, Lord, you know, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1943.48s)]
*  humble me from this, soften my heart from it, you know, like whatever. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1949.48s)]
*  So when the opportunity came to go to the state of the union, I'll be honest with you. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1953.92s)]
*  There is no way I was going to leave that state of the union without my kid's name being said, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1962.28s)]
*  you know, and and I feel like [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1966.92s)]
*  I feel like. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1969.84s)]
*  And but at first, I thought that they would say something, so I felt like it was the Lord [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1972.24s)]
*  telling me, like, here, you know, your reward for being patient and faithful for three years, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1975.76s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to bless you with this. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1980.3999999999999s)]
*  You understand what I'm saying? [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1982.6s)]
*  And then it didn't happen. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1984.36s)]
*  You know, it's like it didn't happen. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1985.76s)]
*  And I was I was able to see my other the other parents. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1988.04s)]
*  I was I found them in the crowds, you know, where they were at [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1992.12s)]
*  and just the way that they were looking, the despair and the [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=1995.96s)]
*  the sadness that they had at that state of the union, everyone was slumped over, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2000.16s)]
*  just kind of devastated, you know. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2004.72s)]
*  And another thing I was like concerned, like like the state, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2008.24s)]
*  you would think that the speaker of the House would have the best seats, right? [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2012.5600000000002s)]
*  Like, all right, well, these two families are getting the speaker of the House. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2015.6000000000001s)]
*  And I was I remember praying to Lord like. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2019.76s)]
*  Lord, you know, why don't I have those seats? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2021.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, why don't I have the best seats? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2025.04s)]
*  I'm thinking I don't know that they are. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2026.8799999999999s)]
*  And then McCall gives up one of his seats, you know, and he's the head of the chairman. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2028.8s)]
*  Right. So whoever got that, say, oh, Lord, why didn't I get that seat? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2033.24s)]
*  You know, and that's all right. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2039.32s)]
*  Thank you for the seats that you give. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2040.52s)]
*  I don't even know where my seats are, but I'm just assuming, you know, that's how people they do. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2041.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, we do this. We do our own assumptions. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2045.8799999999999s)]
*  As it turns out, the seats I got were like right directly like I was watching the president, like, you know. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2048.24s)]
*  Right in front of him, like right where he comes out of that tunnel. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2057.2s)]
*  I was sitting right above there. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2060.7999999999997s)]
*  So the Lord had given me like the best seats in the whole world. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2062.4399999999996s)]
*  And like for the last two weeks, I'm like, oh, Lord, you didn't give me, you know, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2066.0s)]
*  I don't even know what the seats are, but I'm assuming that the worst. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2069.72s)]
*  And a lot of this has happened to me in the course of of the last two weeks. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2072.4399999999996s)]
*  Of this, you know, by being patient, I feel like the Lord has blessed me. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2078.28s)]
*  And these these are the little blessings that I need. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2082.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't need any praise. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2084.44s)]
*  I don't I don't want to put anything on Facebook and then read those comments. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2085.56s)]
*  Oh, God bless you. You're so awesome. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2089.48s)]
*  And none of that. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2091.6400000000003s)]
*  So what happened after? [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2093.8s)]
*  So you called out your son's name and said, Abby, gate. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2095.44s)]
*  And then what happened? Yeah. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2098.56s)]
*  So then those there was these two young men and they came and kind of grabbed me. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2099.8s)]
*  And escorted me up. Who were they? [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2107.72s)]
*  So I guess they were the Capitol Police, but they were in like suits. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2111.2799999999997s)]
*  So they weren't they weren't dressed. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2116.12s)]
*  In police uniforms or anything like that. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2119.2799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, they escorted me into the hallway. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2122.64s)]
*  And then at that time, the guy that was telling you that's been with us [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2126.52s)]
*  from the beginning, Marlon, he came, he ran. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2129.4s)]
*  He was sitting at the other side and he ran to me. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2132.2799999999997s)]
*  And I wasn't scared until I seen his face. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2135.4s)]
*  Then I was like, when I seen him turn the corner, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2141.76s)]
*  like around gallery six and I saw his expression, then I was nervous. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2145.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, I was like, oh, you know, I would travel. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2150.76s)]
*  And yeah, so they they frisked me. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2153.76s)]
*  He tried to say, oh, release them to me, you know, really. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2156.96s)]
*  So they're like, no, you know, you're getting them. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2159.6000000000004s)]

*  And I had to give you a ticket. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2165.04s)]
*  And I kept telling him, hey, Marlon, get my Bible, get my Bible. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2166.6s)]
*  I want him to grab my ticket out of my pocket to go and get my Bible. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2169.64s)]
*  But he doesn't he doesn't want to touch me because I'm detained. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2173.44s)]

*  And they knew I was a gold star dad, too, because he had told him. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2187.16s)]
*  He's all hey, he's a gold star dad, you know. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2189.88s)]
*  And there was a reporter who after she said that, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2193.0s)]
*  after he said that, she said, sir, why did you do what you did? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2196.32s)]

*  No, no, no. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2250.0s)]
*  That wasn't until I got back to the Capitol Police. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2251.92s)]
*  But at the Capitol Police, they asked, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2255.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, they turned in all my stuff. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2260.32s)]
*  They take it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2262.56s)]
*  And the one of the boys that was just in his [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2264.1200000000003s)]
*  his his suit was asking me questions, like, you know, my my name and everything. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2267.6800000000003s)]
*  And then afterwards, secret service and another guy from Capitol Police [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2274.28s)]
*  come in and then they read me my Miranda rights [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2278.28s)]
*  and asked me if I wanted to talk to them and let me know that, look, [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2282.4s)]
*  you know, you'll probably be out of here in an hour. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2286.92s)]
*  It's fifty dollars. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2290.48s)]
*  And, you know, do you want to talk to us? [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2292.2400000000002s)]
*  And I said, yeah, I'll talk to you. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2294.0800000000004s)]
*  What do they ask you? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2296.0400000000004s)]
*  So he asked me. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2297.8s)]
*  So the one gentleman that wasn't that worked for Capitol Police [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2298.8s)]
*  asked me why I had done what I did. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2301.76s)]
*  And so I'm crying. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2304.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, I'm telling them. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2305.12s)]
*  And both of these kids [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2306.52s)]
*  were service members, ex-service members. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2310.36s)]
*  I think he was a soldier and the secret service guy. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2313.6s)]
*  I think he was in the Air Force. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2316.36s)]
*  And so I was telling them, you know, my story, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2318.36s)]
*  you know, like, hey, this guy's never said my kid's name. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2322.7599999999998s)]
*  I lost my kid in Afghanistan. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2325.04s)]
*  And, you know, I'm really emotional, you know. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2327.08s)]
*  But that Capitol policeman, he kept every five minutes, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2329.72s)]
*  he would say, Kareem, would just look at me [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2332.9199999999996s)]
*  and say my kid's name and he would tell me I'll never forget. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2336.68s)]
*  You know, like every five minutes, he would just say this to me. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2340.0s)]
*  And to come for you. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2343.64s)]
*  Yeah. Good man. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2345.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was a great man. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2346.68s)]
*  Then, you know, asked me, hey, have you gotten any help? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2347.9199999999996s)]
*  Like, no, I don't need any help. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2352.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm just right now, you know, I'm feeling this way. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2354.7999999999997s)]
*  He had told me that, he had told me that, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2357.28s)]
*  well, we, you know, if you say something [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2363.0400000000004s)]
*  and then we tell you to be quiet and then you don't, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2365.92s)]
*  then we arrest you again, then we arrest you. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2368.1200000000003s)]
*  And I said, well, nobody ever told me to be quiet, you know. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2370.8s)]
*  I never was afforded that opportunity. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2373.96s)]
*  And then he left. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2376.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he left. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2378.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he left. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2380.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he left. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2382.6800000000003s)]
*  And then he left. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2385.3599999999997s)]
*  And then they asked me more questions. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2387.04s)]
*  The other kid in the suit, you know, just basic questions, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2389.24s)]
*  sex, weight and stuff like this. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2393.8799999999997s)]
*  And then he came back and he said that again. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2395.48s)]
*  And then he said, well, there's two ways. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2398.04s)]
*  Like we can ask you. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2400.08s)]
*  And then ask you again and arrest you or we can just arrest you. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2403.0s)]
*  And he's all, you don't want to be that because that's a felony. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2408.16s)]
*  So I felt like he was kind of throwing me a bone, you know, like [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2410.56s)]
*  and I kind of picked up on that and I was all, all right. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2414.48s)]
*  You know, I appreciate that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2417.08s)]
*  Yeah, I guess they did tell me. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2418.64s)]
*  When did they let you go? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2421.92s)]
*  So what happened was, was that, you know, as we're talking [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2423.56s)]
*  and he's telling me this stuff, he says the congressman is outside. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2426.96s)]
*  So we I was invited by Congressman Brian Mast [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2430.32s)]
*  and Brian Mast bailed me out of jail. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2434.2s)]
*  Look, was there. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2437.44s)]
*  And he's all the congressman's right outside the door. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2439.04s)]
*  And I felt like. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2441.6000000000004s)]
*  Like a million dollars, because I knew like, all right, I'm all right now. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2445.0400000000004s)]
*  You know, I mean, I've got the congressman, you know, to help me. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2448.6400000000003s)]
*  And so, yeah, he got me out and walked me [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2453.92s)]
*  and had met, you know, had met him. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2457.1200000000003s)]
*  We've met him several times. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2459.52s)]
*  He's there's only, you know, there's there's four congressmen [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2462.1600000000003s)]
*  that I call the four horsemen and they're military men. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2465.0800000000004s)]
*  So they understand it's Issa, Mills, Mast and Waltz. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2469.64s)]
*  And then they're all led by [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2473.96s)]
*  the chairman, Michael McCall. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2477.64s)]
*  So he's he's the chair of the House of Foreign Affairs. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2480.2799999999997s)]
*  And he's the one that's able to bring these hearings. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2483.68s)]
*  And then these guys are just, you know, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2486.48s)]
*  they're the ones that we're telling our stories to. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2489.44s)]
*  And they're helping do whatever they do in Washington to get get the message out. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2492.04s)]
*  So the fact that he was there meant a lot to me, like, [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2496.96s)]
*  like, all right, you know, I'm not. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2501.52s)]
*  Because to be honest with you. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2503.68s)]
*  From what I see on TV, you know, yeah, we love you. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2506.48s)]
*  But the next day, I'll be on my own. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2509.84s)]
*  This is my I'm thinking, you know, I'm like, I'm going to be all by myself. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2511.2s)]
*  You know, this is great for tonight. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2514.2799999999997s)]
*  But come the 28th, when I've got to go to court, I'm going to be by myself. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2516.6s)]
*  But the fact that he was there and, you know, [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2521.92s)]
*  he's a man of God and we prayed before. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2525.88s)]
*  I don't know if we prayed before, but we talked about like what we're talking about [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2529.2400000000002s)]
*  in our in our the spiritual. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2532.6800000000003s)]
*  You know. Road that that I've taken with my son. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2537.28s)]
*  And it was I was just really blessed that he was there and he got me out. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2542.44s)]
*  And then when I got out, you know, I said, Waltz, all of them, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2548.44s)]
*  we're not going to let anything happen. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2553.8s)]
*  You know, we're going to stand by. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2555.4s)]
*  And even they telling me this, I still felt like, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2557.1600000000003s)]
*  a week from now, would it be by myself? [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2560.88s)]
*  You know, I never really had any. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2562.76s)]
*  You know, true belief like, hey, these guys are going to be here [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2565.7200000000003s)]
*  till the end, but they were, I mean, every couple of days they would [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2569.2000000000003s)]
*  they would do what they have to do. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2572.6800000000003s)]
*  And and from what I understand, they found out that because the gavel [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2574.1200000000003s)]
*  wasn't hit, that I didn't I didn't obstruct Congress. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2578.6800000000003s)]
*  So the fact that Mike Johnson helped that. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2583.6000000000004s)]
*  So Ken Calvert, Mike Johnson, Waltz and Darrell Issa. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2585.88s)]
*  And to some extent, Mast and Mills, they, you know, helped to get this out. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2592.2400000000002s)]
*  Like, hey, he didn't he didn't obstruct anything because the gavel wasn't hit. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2596.92s)]
*  What's your life been like at home since you died? [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2601.36s)]
*  Yeah. So. Yeah. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2605.2400000000002s)]

*  It's better now. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2612.3999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, at the beginning, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2613.3999999999996s)]
*  when this first happened was was just devastating. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2616.52s)]
*  I didn't really have a home where I could [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2620.24s)]
*  recuperate from this. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2623.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, my son and I, you know, [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2625.64s)]
*  Kareem's real best friend was his little brother, Steven. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2627.52s)]
*  And he was like 15 when this happened. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2630.6s)]
*  And so I just said, focus, I'm focusing on him. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2633.52s)]
*  Like, you know, he's and he's so strong and so brave, you know, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2637.56s)]

*  He was 15. And they were best friends. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2644.44s)]
*  And man, he's a rock, you know, you know, Kareem was a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2647.3599999999997s)]

*  They're not weak in that aspect, but, you know, they're very [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2665.3999999999996s)]
*  compassionate to the underdog. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2669.2s)]
*  They're very quiet. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2670.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, Kareem was a little guy growing up, so he sometimes would be bullied. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2673.64s)]
*  And that was one of my concern when he started to learn how to fight. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2679.48s)]
*  You know, I was like, you know. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2682.56s)]
*  I don't ever want to hear that you're bullying anyone or you're doing any of this. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2685.3599999999997s)]
*  And and luckily, that never happened, you know, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2689.3199999999997s)]
*  he was always compassionate to the underdog and the people [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2693.2s)]
*  that couldn't speak for themselves. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2697.64s)]
*  So, you know, our home life was just [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2699.64s)]
*  it was just chaotic for the first year. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2704.52s)]
*  And but but I think maybe the Lord had that happen [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2707.08s)]
*  to keep me from. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2712.4s)]
*  Ruining myself, to understand I'm saying, like all that probably happened [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2717.72s)]
*  just so I wouldn't ruin whatever, you know, I just [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2722.3599999999997s)]
*  I just went in my room and just focused on the little things, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2727.12s)]
*  you know, my son and whatever I could. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2731.84s)]
*  And because there's a there's a lot of, oh, we want to do this for your kid [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2733.96s)]
*  and we want this interview and this and that. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2739.48s)]
*  And for me to mitigate, like, how could how could these parents [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2743.56s)]
*  not like feel some sort of like pride or something after all this? Right. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2748.7599999999998s)]
*  And I remember telling my kids, look, you know, be careful. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2753.96s)]
*  How you deal with this, because it won't always be there. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2757.6s)]
*  And then you're going to resent the fact that it's not there. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2760.88s)]
*  That's right. And don't forget, there's tens of thousands of service [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2763.48s)]
*  members who died that don't have, you know, [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2767.96s)]
*  shootery boards at their front doorstep with a knock. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2770.56s)]
*  I mean, it was just insane stuff at your front door. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2773.2s)]
*  Cards, we love you money, checks, you understand. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  And every check, every cash ever got, I still have it. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2782.04s)]
*  So I never spent any of that night in every card that we got. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2785.64s)]
*  I not probably every one of them, because it was just too much. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2789.3199999999997s)]
*  But I wrote, you know, back to them. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2793.72s)]
*  I remember telling my kids, hey, you know, watch out how you [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2797.52s)]
*  how you process this and what you do with it, because [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2801.12s)]
*  it's going to ruin you in your faith. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2805.64s)]
*  Another thing that that two other things today is our anniversary, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2809.44s)]
*  my sons and I got baptized. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2815.08s)]
*  We got baptized on. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2818.1600000000003s)]
*  March 26, 2017, and we got baptized together in the same pool and. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2823.1200000000003s)]
*  In the year, so the other thing is, is that like when you lose someone, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2831.6000000000004s)]
*  like when I lost my mom, I lost my dad within a week, like they died on a Thursday. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2835.56s)]
*  Next Thursday, you bury him and that was it. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2839.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, I mean, you start trying to put your life together. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2842.3999999999996s)]
*  And this situation didn't really happen. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2847.24s)]
*  I mean, it was like five weeks. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2849.08s)]
*  They brought back his body and. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2850.6s)]
*  You know, things come up, certain little things would come up like I know that they had the. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2855.2s)]
*  And when these things come up, you kind of focus towards that. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2862.52s)]
*  So you repress your feelings and everything for this one event. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2865.12s)]
*  Right. And you're like, OK, well, this event's coming up [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2868.52s)]
*  and I'm going to I'm focusing on that. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2871.8s)]
*  And one of the events we had in November was the [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2874.52s)]
*  the memorial at Camp Pendleton. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2878.1200000000003s)]
*  Now, since he was he lived, we live like 45 minutes from Camp Pendleton. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2880.36s)]
*  He came home every weekend. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2885.96s)]
*  So the only time I never seen him was when he actually deployed, you know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2887.96s)]
*  and he'd bring his marine friends home with them. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2892.04s)]
*  And I felt bad because some of them lived in Iowa. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2894.4s)]
*  There was no way they could see their family. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2898.2000000000003s)]
*  So if we can give them a weekend where they felt at home, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2899.96s)]
*  then I was all for that, you know, it was kind of like around covid. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2903.96s)]
*  So we were cooking breakfast and couldn't really go to church. And I had the [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2908.64s)]
*  sometimes I'd have the TV on [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2914.6800000000003s)]
*  with. Our preacher, our pastor, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2917.6800000000003s)]
*  and they'd play games and they do whatever, you know, and my son would take them on hikes [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2922.76s)]
*  and they would drink on Fridays, you know, whatever they [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2927.16s)]
*  however they had their own mind, you know, they were able to do it at our house. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2931.56s)]
*  And I was I was blessed that that we could provide that for them. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2934.96s)]
*  And so we had this memorial for the Marines. Right. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2939.96s)]
*  And, you know, I never did any interviews or anything. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2943.72s)]
*  I didn't want to be I didn't that wasn't right for me. And [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2946.68s)]
*  so I had focused on my heart towards this memorial, which was in November [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2952.1600000000003s)]
*  and surpassed all my feelings and everything. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2958.36s)]
*  And well, I'm just going to focus on on that part. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2960.92s)]
*  And we went to the memorial and it was beautiful. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2963.92s)]
*  And they had the missing man formation with the helicopters that went over the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2966.28s)]
*  the mountain where he would hike over there in Camp Pendleton. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2971.0s)]
*  And then I think that was either on a Thursday or Friday. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2975.4s)]
*  And then on that Sunday, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2978.3999999999996s)]
*  I just I felt like a lot of remorse. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2982.72s)]
*  I felt like grief, you know, and for me, but my religion, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2985.24s)]
*  which is Christian, you know, for me, that I felt like for me to display [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2988.9199999999996s)]
*  grief is me saying I don't believe in the Lord. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=2996.9599999999996s)]
*  You know, is that weird? I don't know. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3000.9599999999996s)]
*  And so I'd never really just had any grief. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3003.2s)]
*  I never had any sorrow. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3006.0s)]
*  Except for that day. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3009.52s)]
*  I remember I was in my master bedroom and it was the Sunday [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3010.7599999999998s)]
*  and there was nothing else to look look forward to. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3015.3999999999996s)]
*  There was no other event. That was the last event. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3018.12s)]
*  And I remember just like [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3022.2s)]
*  feeling, you know, immense grief, sorrow. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3026.12s)]
*  And I was like, Lord, why am I looking out at the mountains that he would [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3029.64s)]
*  put weights in his rucksack and hike? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3033.16s)]
*  And I was like, Lord, you know, why do I have this feeling? [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3036.68s)]
*  You know, why do I have this? Why? Why am I feeling this way? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3039.2s)]
*  And then he said, hey, the Holy Spirit or the Lord told me, [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3043.12s)]
*  hey, look at the day that you went to Harvest Festival. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3048.12s)]
*  So Harvest Festival. So we gave our lives to Jesus Christ together. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3051.36s)]
*  All right. And the day that we went to Harvest Festival, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3055.3199999999997s)]
*  we went to Harvest Festival together. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3058.96s)]
*  All right. In this place, in Angel Stadium, [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3061.16s)]
*  by a fellow named Greg Laurie, who does the same thing that [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3066.12s)]
*  I forgot his name, but [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3073.56s)]
*  Evangelical in the 70s. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3075.3199999999997s)]
*  Billy Graham. Billy Graham would do the same thing. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3078.2s)]
*  So they'd go to these stadiums, they'd preach the gospel, [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3080.44s)]
*  and you had an opportunity to give your life to Jesus Christ there. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3083.44s)]
*  And Billy Graham's things, he's doing the same thing. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3086.92s)]
*  He's been doing it for like 20 years. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3090.52s)]
*  So if I could just go back in like 2015, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3092.52s)]
*  I realized that my kids didn't have the same faith like like I did. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3097.24s)]
*  You know, that guy said, you need to be Christian. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3101.0s)]
*  And once in a while would say, but I didn't lead and I didn't tell them about it. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3104.12s)]
*  So my kids were already older, you know, so I didn't have it. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3108.8399999999997s)]
*  I didn't have an opportunity to indoctrinate them when they were younger. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3112.6s)]
*  And I was praying, you know, Lord, please, you know, I failed, you know, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3116.52s)]
*  give me an opportunity. And he did, you know, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3120.04s)]
*  Kareem started asking about a church in like, in 2015, we started going. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3123.7999999999997s)]
*  And I knew that I could tell them, hey, you got to do this. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3129.96s)]
*  But they, I had to change, you know, I had to make an [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3133.24s)]
*  a concerted effort to make a change and be [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3136.68s)]
*  sincere with the faith so that they would follow because I can't just tell them something, [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3141.32s)]
*  I have to lead by example. And so that transformation happened. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3145.3199999999997s)]
*  It took a year or something and the pastor was like, hey, you know, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3149.24s)]
*  Greg Laurie is having this thing down there and we encourage everyone to go. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3155.88s)]
*  So I'm thinking, Lord, this is our opportunity. Thank you. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3161.3199999999997s)]
*  You know, and they're that we're going to church every weekend, me and my sons every Sunday. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3164.2799999999997s)]
*  And we're working through, I'm working through the different things and being real with them, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3169.3199999999997s)]
*  you know, ties, you know, how do you deal with ties? Right? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3174.84s)]
*  Like at first I was like, I'm not giving them any money, you know, and, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3177.96s)]
*  and my pastor had said something at the time. He's all like, well, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3182.28s)]
*  do you guys like in this weeks later, he had said, well, do you guys like air conditioning? [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3187.1600000000003s)]
*  And that just, I realized like my ties are for the air conditioning and it made me. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3190.84s)]
*  So I made a point to, yeah, I talked bad about the ties before. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3195.88s)]
*  I'm going to make a point to show my kids that look, I've changed. I realized, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3200.92s)]
*  and we're going to start giving ties. So the boys, I would give them their money so that they would [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3205.4s)]
*  know to give ties. So every Sunday we would be given our ties. And that's just an example of how [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3209.96s)]
*  we worked through some of the obstacles in our faith, you know, and we're real about it. You know, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3214.84s)]
*  we weren't just saying it, we were acting upon it. And so we went to Greg Laurie's [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3220.92s)]
*  and we all gave our lives to Jesus Christ, you know, Steven Shiler, Steven, Kareem, me, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3228.68s)]
*  and Shanna, we all gave our lives to Jesus. And, and I felt blessed, you know, I was like, wow, [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3236.52s)]
*  like this doesn't happen. You know, I mean, who gets this opportunity? I failed. And then, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3243.3999999999996s)]
*  but I prayed for a solid year, you know, please Lord, please. And just such a blessing. And then [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3249.0s)]
*  from that blessing, you know, we were, we always went to church, you know, it was, it was became [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3256.12s)]
*  part of our background and me telling and preaching to the boys, you know, you know, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3261.08s)]
*  about the gospel as well as our, our pastor. And then fast forward to that time when I was right [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3267.0s)]
*  after the, right after the Camp Pendleton Memorial, the Lord, and I'm looking out in the backyard and [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3273.48s)]
*  I'm feeling grief and I'm just feeling horrible, you know, the first time in like eight months or [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3283.48s)]
*  whatever. And I'm like, why do I feel this way? You know, I, you know, and the Lord said, hey, Steve, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3287.96s)]
*  look at when you went to harvest festival. That's what it's called. And we only went on Fridays [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3295.0s)]
*  because Sunday would be, people wouldn't go to church. So they'd go Saturday, same thing, [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3303.16s)]
*  but Friday would be after work. So I just knew like, Hey, we went to the first time it was on [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3309.8s)]
*  Friday. And then every other time we went on Fridays. So I knew that it was on a Friday [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3314.28s)]
*  and I Googled, you know, when was, when was the harvest festival? [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3319.7200000000003s)]

*  And like, I got goosebumps and like all my grief went away and it just let me know that the Lord [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3334.2000000000003s)]
*  had planned this for me. And, and that was verification, you know, that on August 26, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3339.4s)]
*  2016, we gave our lives to Jesus Christ. And on August 26, 2021, he took my son. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3347.64s)]
*  And that was, that's pretty powerful, you know, to let me know, you know, and that was just for me, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3358.2000000000003s)]

*  And, and he didn't know this otherwise he would have been all over it. You know, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3383.5600000000004s)]
*  everyone would have been all over that, I would assume, but that was just for me. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3387.8s)]
*  That was just for me, you know, that the Lord told me that like, to let me know that [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzHSK7WXqok&t=3393.16s)]
