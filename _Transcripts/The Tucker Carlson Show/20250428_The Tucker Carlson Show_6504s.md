# Catherine Fitts: Bankers vs. the West, Secret Underground Bases, and the Oncoming Extinction Event
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew)
*  The US economy and financial system is the leader globally in laundering dirty money. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=0.0s)]
*  I said to this wonderful group, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the lectern [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5.2s)]
*  and if you push that button, you can stop all hard narcotics trafficking tomorrow. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=9.52s)]
*  Who here will push the button? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=14.8s)]
*  And out of a hundred people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, guess how many would [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=16.32s)]
*  push the button? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=20.6s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=21.6s)]
*  One. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=22.6s)]
*  You suggested the control grid is in part designed to manage the population. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=23.6s)]
*  So if you want to move people to a much lower economic footprint, having complete control [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=27.8s)]
*  is obviously very convenient. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=32.76s)]
*  Okay, so the bottom line is the majority is about to get a lot poorer. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=34.04s)]
*  So the question is where's all this money going? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=36.8s)]
*  And one of the things I've looked at is the underground base and city infrastructure and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=38.8s)]
*  transportation system that's been built. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=44.64s)]
*  What would be the purpose? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  I think if you're worried about a near extinction event. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=48.0s)]
*  So thank you for doing this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=57.8s)]
*  You get, I know you worked on this for years, but you get the sense if you're just a sort [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=74.4s)]
*  of aware person that there is a concerted attempt by governments around the world to [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=78.88s)]
*  commerce and to digitize currency and to basically control people through money. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=84.34s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  So that was my first question. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  Is this happening? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=96.58s)]
*  Am I imagining it? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=97.58s)]
*  It's absolutely happening. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=98.58s)]
*  And what's important to understand, it's been happening for a long time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  In other words, this is like an invisible corral that they've been building around you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=104.10000000000001s)]
*  for a long, long time. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=110.7s)]
*  How do a few sneak up on the many? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=113.06s)]
*  Well, you have to do it very quietly invisibly before you throw the trap. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=114.94s)]
*  So essentially what they're building, because it's converting a currency system into a control [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=119.66s)]
*  system. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=125.54s)]
*  So it's really the end of currency. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=126.54s)]
*  And what they're doing is they've been building the different digital pieces. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=129.38s)]
*  And when it integrates and comes together, then you literally have a digital concentration [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=134.02s)]
*  camp. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=139.14000000000001s)]
*  It's complete and utter control. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=140.14000000000001s)]
*  Otherwise known as the world. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=141.7s)]
*  Here's the thing to understand. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=143.7s)]
*  You and I grew up in a world where there was mass media, where you were pitching stories. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=146.17999999999998s)]
*  So you had 57 varieties of ice cream and you're pitching them to 57 different niches, but [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=151.54s)]
*  you're still pitching to mass audiences. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=156.57999999999998s)]
*  What we're talking about is a system where you can surveil, control, and influence one [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=159.5s)]
*  person at a time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=166.7s)]
*  And with AI and software, each person can have their custom surveillance, influence, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=168.54s)]
*  nudging, and control system. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=174.1s)]
*  And punishment. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=176.38s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=177.38s)]
*  Enforcement. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=178.38s)]
*  Because ultimately if you control money, you can starve people to death. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=179.38s)]
*  You can kill them. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=182.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=183.06s)]
*  So go back and think of the pandemic. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=184.06s)]
*  So if I say you can't go more than a mile from your home, and I say you have to be mandated [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=186.26s)]
*  a pharmaceutical, then if you don't take the pharmaceutical, I can turn off your money. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=194.70000000000002s)]
*  If you go more than a mile away from your home, your money and your credit cards won't [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=200.54s)]
*  work. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=204.46s)]
*  So whatever rules I lay down, there's a wonderful, wonderful example. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=205.54s)]
*  The head of the Bank of International Settlements is the central bank of central banks. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=211.74s)]
*  And it's been running the process to implement basically an all digital monetary system. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=217.82s)]
*  And they have innovation hubs all over the world. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=224.78s)]
*  They've been running this process for a long time. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=226.98s)]
*  In 2020, when the pandemic started, or it was October 2020, so the pandemic was underway, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=229.06s)]
*  the general manager of the Bank of International Settlements was on an IMF panel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=236.1s)]
*  And in one minute, first time in my life I ever saw a central banker tell the truth. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=241.54s)]
*  I fell off my chair. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=245.9s)]
*  And he said, you know, the beauty of this is we can set the rules on how your money [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=247.86s)]
*  works and we have the technology to enforce them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=255.18s)]
*  And what he was saying is literally from one place in, you know, anywhere in the world [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=259.52s)]
*  where the technology exists, you can track each person individually, you can set a complex [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=266.98s)]
*  list of rules, you know, like legislation, regulation and administrative policy, and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=273.58s)]
*  you can enforce them all with the technology, with AI and software. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=279.18s)]
*  So have you ever seen, there's a wonderful movie called The Lives of Others about the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=283.62s)]
*  German Stasi and surveillance. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=288.9s)]
*  It's about a group of artists and sort of creative, talented people who are under surveillance [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=290.94s)]
*  by the German Stasi. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=295.5s)]
*  And you see what it's like to be under surveillance for 24-7. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=297.26s)]
*  Think of each one of us, we're all under surveillance, not just by governments, but [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=303.04s)]
*  by corporations who are trying to do something. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=307.44000000000005s)]
*  And it may not be anything nefarious. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=310.72s)]
*  So 80 different companies are trying to sell you something or 80 different companies are [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=313.16s)]
*  trying to get your data for some reason. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  And so they have AI and software bots that track you and follow you and learn from you [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=321.6s)]
*  and try and influence what you do because they're trying to extract some kind of value [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  from you. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=331.96s)]
*  And literally think of being attacked by a swarm of bees. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  We're surrounded now by a swarm of AI software bots, all trying to learn from us, extract [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=336.59999999999997s)]
*  something from us or get us to do something. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=345.28s)]
*  Now, when you go to an all digital system, then there is no escape. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=347.12s)]
*  And then they can start literally to enforce rules. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  They do now. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  So what are the manifestations of this that maybe we're not paying attention to or don't [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=356.92s)]
*  perceive for what they are? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  So look at what they did to the Canadian truckers. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=363.8s)]
*  We don't like what you're doing. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=366.84000000000003s)]
*  We cut off your money and we cut off your friends' money. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=367.96000000000004s)]
*  And if people help you, we cut off their money too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  So I've known so many different people around the country who've been debanked. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=373.32000000000005s)]
*  We just got legislation passed in Tennessee that a bank over a certain size couldn't [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=377.68s)]
*  someone for political or religious reasons. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=382.64s)]
*  You know, and you're one of the things that's happening. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=385.56s)]
*  There's no such federal law. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=388.2s)]
*  Not that I know of, but I haven't. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=390.12s)]
*  I've been working with the states because ultimately the one power currently under the [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=391.72s)]
*  Constitution in the United States that can stop this, the power is not delegated to the [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=399.72s)]
*  federal government by the states, are reserved to the states. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=404.6s)]
*  In other words, the states are technically more powerful than the federal government. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=408.28s)]
*  And under the Constitution, they have the power to override the federal government on many [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=412.84s)]
*  different issues, including health care. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=418.12s)]
*  And so one of the tensions we see in America is more and more there is a debate between the [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=420.84s)]
*  feds and the states about who has what power. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=427.28s)]
*  So we've seen a lot of the conservative AGs and treasurers pushing back in a wonderful way, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=431.35999999999996s)]
*  in a marvelous way. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=438.71999999999997s)]
*  The challenge they have is this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=441.11999999999995s)]
*  This was said to me by a senator in northern Ohio. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=444.0s)]
*  Northern Ohio has one of the best groups of sort of freedom fighting legislators in the [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=446.67999999999995s)]
*  country. And as you probably know, because you know, it's very beautiful. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=451.28s)]
*  And so what? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=455.96s)]
*  Montana, Idaho, Idaho. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=457.15999999999997s)]
*  So so but it's right, you know, it's right next to Montana. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=459.36s)]
*  So one of the Idaho senators said to me, he said, my problem every time I fight to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=462.15999999999997s)]
*  implement the Constitution, he said, what I learn is that every year we send a dollar to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=467.28s)]
*  Washington and every year Washington sends back a dollar and 19 cents. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=473.88s)]
*  And when I say I want to implement the Constitution, my constituents say to me, I'd [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=478.48s)]
*  rather have the 19 cents. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=482.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=484.08s)]
*  So what we've been watching literally since World War Two is the federal government and a [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=484.48s)]
*  very, you know, largesse both monetary and fiscal policy, buying people out of the [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=491.16s)]
*  Constitution and buying the whole federal. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=497.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the federal government is right now operating so far outside the law. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=500.52s)]
*  It's, you know, you know how unbelievable it is. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=504.08s)]
*  So that's the challenge before us. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=507.08s)]
*  If we want to be free, you know, we're going to have to decide we're not going to let [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=509.68s)]
*  ourselves be, you know, it's like being sort of walked into the slaughterhouse. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=515.96s)]
*  We're not going to walk into the slaughterhouse. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=521.4s)]
*  But you don't even I guess what bothers me about it, there's something wonderfully [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=523.76s)]
*  straightforward, horrifying, but wonderfully straightforward about just a conventional [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=528.64s)]
*  invasion where people show up with guns and tell you what to do, because at least you [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=531.52s)]
*  know who the enemy is. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=534.64s)]
*  But there's something very scary in an insidious way about being lulled into slavery. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=535.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=543.36s)]
*  And the thing to understand about the lulling is the lulling. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=543.68s)]
*  The marketing plan works one person at a time. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=547.68s)]
*  In other words, you know, you I buy with money, your friend, I buy by knocking them off for [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=550.72s)]
*  the other, you know, your other friend, I get a control file on. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=556.76s)]
*  So there are thousands of different ways of nudging, buying carrots and sticks to get [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=560.56s)]
*  everybody into the control and into the trap. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=566.24s)]
*  And and what is so insidious about this is much of the marketing plan is invisible and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=569.88s)]
*  it's and it really is crafted one by one. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=577.52s)]
*  The odds seem overwhelming against the average person in a system that you just described. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=580.56s)]
*  So how far are we from not being able to exercise constitutional freedoms? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=585.16s)]
*  So I don't know how many years they're clearly pushing to have this done by 2030. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, what I do have to say is if you look at what it takes to stop it, I [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=599.48s)]
*  believe they're going to fail. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=605.52s)]
*  Now, what I don't underestimate is how much damage they could do. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=607.2s)]
*  And the, you know, the failure may not come in time to save America. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=611.32s)]
*  So if we just stop and define terms, who's they? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=615.36s)]
*  The central bankers. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=619.88s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=621.52s)]
*  So we have a democratic republic or we have a republic and use this democratic process. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=622.44s)]
*  What happened in 1913 is the bankers took control of monetary policy. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=630.0s)]
*  What they're trying to do now is take control of fiscal policy. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=634.8s)]
*  Once they get control of fiscal policy, it's going to be much harder to reverse it. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=638.2s)]
*  Can you, I'm going to ask a series of really dumb questions. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=642.48s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  I hope you'll indulge me. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=645.88s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  Taxation without representation. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=648.24s)]
*  But between fiscal and monetary policy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=650.2s)]
*  OK. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  Monetary policy is I control the process by which currency is issued, including through [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=652.32s)]
*  credit. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=659.72s)]
*  So I generally govern and control credit issuance. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=660.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=664.72s)]
*  And from that, the currency, the creation and management of the currency. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=665.2s)]
*  Fiscal policy is when I control the taxes and the borrowing of the US government. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=670.32s)]
*  Now, because the central bank basically operates the borrowing, you know, it's the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=675.0400000000001s)]
*  borrowing is shared. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=681.96s)]
*  But this comes down as the, you know, this is the Boston Tea Party moment. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=682.9200000000001s)]
*  Can they tax without representation? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=687.84s)]
*  So I'll give you a little story. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=690.36s)]
*  During the Biden administration, Biden nominated somebody for control of currency who [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  was ultimately not approved. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  The Republicans in the Senate killed the nomination before she was nominated three [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=700.6800000000001s)]
*  weeks before she wrote an article in the Vanderbilt Law Review that said the great [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  thing about central bank digital currency, in other words, an all digital currency [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=709.5600000000001s)]
*  system is you have the perfect tool to deal with inflation. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=713.9200000000001s)]
*  If inflation gets out of hand, you just freeze everybody's bank accounts. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=718.08s)]
*  Nice. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=723.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=724.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=725.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=725.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, so it's, so. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=725.88s)]
*  Inflation is a creation of monetary. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=730.8399999999999s)]
*  It's the effect of monetary policy. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=733.0s)]
*  It's like something that somebody did to you. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=734.4s)]
*  Well, there are two things that cause inflation. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=737.5999999999999s)]
*  So one is monetary policy, managing monetary policy in a way that creates [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=740.04s)]
*  and monetary inflation, but you also have, and we're going through it now, what I [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=746.76s)]
*  call de-globalization where you have real increases in the cost of goods. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=752.04s)]
*  So my cost of goods are going up and it's not because they're issuing, you [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=757.08s)]
*  know, too much currency relative to growth. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=761.48s)]
*  It's because we are reversing globalization. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=763.68s)]
*  Globalization created a whole lot of lower costs for variety of reasons. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=767.04s)]
*  So if you had a severing of supply chains, for example, that would cause inflation [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=772.36s)]
*  because it just costs more to get the materials and the goods. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=775.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=778.12s)]
*  And, and it's not just higher prices. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=778.48s)]
*  It's, you know, some products, a lot of products stop being economic and just go away. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=781.1999999999999s)]
*  So, you know, when you hiccup supply chains, especially if you do it by [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=786.76s)]
*  shock doctor or shock and all, which is what we're watching now, you know, it wrecks [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=792.3199999999999s)]
*  havoc, so think of it like a flotilla of ships that need to turn. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=796.8399999999999s)]
*  If the aircraft carrier doesn't let everybody know they're turning, then the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=802.8s)]
*  boats aren't ready to turn and you have boats smashing into each other. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=806.88s)]
*  You sink a lot of ships. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=810.48s)]
*  You sink a lot of ships. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=811.32s)]
*  Um, so leaving aside whether that was wise or not, that's what we're doing. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=813.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=817.72s)]
*  Um, so you get inflation out of that. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=818.36s)]
*  Of course, you're absolutely right. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=820.32s)]
*  If oil prices go up, you get inflation. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=821.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=823.08s)]
*  And that de-globalization started in the financial crisis. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=823.48s)]
*  So, you know, so it's accelerating now, but it's not that we just started it. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=827.7600000000001s)]
*  How did it start during, in 2008? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=832.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=834.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=835.6800000000001s)]
*  Because why? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=836.4000000000001s)]
*  Because for several reasons, but one is we were trying to exercise more and more [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=837.44s)]
*  control through the dollar system. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=843.52s)]
*  And we've always exercised a lot of power and control and, and extracted [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=846.2s)]
*  a subsidy from the dollar system. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=850.1600000000001s)]
*  But you have more and more people trying to get out of the system. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=853.1600000000001s)]
*  And, um, the financial crisis, that first, the Asian crisis in [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=856.6800000000001s)]
*  97 was a real wake up to Asia. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=861.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, you need to create more resiliency, but more and more things [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=863.84s)]
*  happened and then in 2008, it started to accelerate with the creation of the, you [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=868.4s)]
*  know, as the bricks started to organize and work to sort of pull out of the. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=873.44s)]
*  So the idea was you've got a world economy based on the dollar, the people [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=877.28s)]
*  who issue and administer the dollar are not running things responsibly. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=881.6800000000001s)]
*  Therefore we need a separate safe haven. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  They're the people running the dollar system, one, a unipolar model. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=894.2s)]
*  The U S wants a unipolar model and we don't want to be part of a unipolar [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=894.6s)]
*  model because we don't want, if you look at the level of subsidy they're [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=898.64s)]
*  extracting, we don't want that level of, of subsidy extracted. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=902.6800000000001s)]
*  And if you look at some of the rules and regulations, we don't want to be a part [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=907.76s)]
*  of it. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=911.32s)]
*  So we in India, the, the, I don't know if you ever saw it, one of the greatest [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  explanations of globalization ever given. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=917.68s)]
*  Sir James Goldsmith came to the United States in 1994 and he did an interview [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=920.56s)]
*  with Charlie Rose and he described why we should never approve the Uruguay [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=924.76s)]
*  round of GATT and Institute the WTO. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=929.76s)]
*  And he, to this day, he nailed, nailed it perfectly. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=932.5999999999999s)]
*  He described. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=936.4s)]
*  If you could summarize his argument, what would it be? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=936.76s)]
*  He said, we are going to hollow out the middle class in the West. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=939.0799999999999s)]
*  And we are going to devastate our culture. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=944.16s)]
*  All the culture. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=948.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=950.0s)]
*  Our culture. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=950.48s)]
*  We're going to devastate our culture and we're going to devastate the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=951.12s)]
*  quality of the food supply. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=954.68s)]
*  He said that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=956.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=957.36s)]
*  So now those are my words of way of saying it. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=958.32s)]
*  You should watch it. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=962.08s)]
*  And I think to this day, I think it's the best description. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=962.76s)]
*  And, and if you read my online book and you listen to Sir James Goldsmith, what [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=967.04s)]
*  they both describe is the fact we knew, we knew what we were in other words, the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=971.92s)]
*  leadership knew that this would destroy or devastate the West. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=976.92s)]
*  So why'd they do it? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=981.1999999999999s)]
*  That's the $64,000 question. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=984.0799999999999s)]
*  I think they hate the West. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=986.88s)]
*  Defenders of the West. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=988.9599999999999s)]
*  I don't think I think one of the reasons they did it is I think they wanted to [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=990.12s)]
*  create the capacity and centralize the capital to the West. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=996.1999999999999s)]
*  They wanted to globalize the capital they needed to go into space. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1000.88s)]
*  And I think they knew that they would need every hundred or so years, the [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1006.28s)]
*  central bankers do a reset. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1010.64s)]
*  And I think they knew they were coming into a reset and, and they felt with this [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1012.76s)]
*  technology that they, you know, if they didn't globalize someone else would and, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1019.24s)]
*  and they wanted to control the process. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1024.32s)]
*  They needed the money to go into space. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1026.12s)]
*  The capital. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1028.84s)]
*  I don't even know what that means. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1029.6s)]
*  So I think they wanted to build the capacity to become a [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1031.1599999999999s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1039.8s)]

*  It means you get to go outside and frolic in the sunshine. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1043.8799999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately, there's a downside. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1047.12s)]
*  Burglars are psyched for the longer days. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1049.36s)]
*  It means fewer people are home and that gives them more chances to break in and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  steal your stuff. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1056.4399999999998s)]
*  This is not our imagination. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1057.12s)]
*  FBI crime data backs it up. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1058.8799999999999s)]
*  More daylight means more burglaries. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1060.4399999999998s)]
*  That's bad, but there is a solution. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1063.3999999999999s)]
*  You can leave your house feeling secure with simply safe. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1066.7199999999998s)]
*  This is a really cool idea. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1070.28s)]
*  Millions of Americans use this. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1072.28s)]
*  It's the highest standard in home security. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1073.84s)]
*  You get peace of mind every time you leave. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1076.04s)]
*  So a traditional burglar arm system of the kind maybe you already have only [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1077.84s)]
*  sets off when someone has already broken into your house. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1082.04s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1084.7199999999998s)]
*  Smash the window, come through the basement door, whatever. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1085.6s)]
*  Simply safe prevents intrusions before they happen. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1088.6399999999999s)]

*  Man, I was caught up in such minutia in 1994. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  I never heard anybody say that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1121.1999999999998s)]
*  I had no idea that was happening. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  So I became, I didn't become convinced of that in 1994. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1124.9199999999998s)]
*  I became convinced. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1128.12s)]
*  Were you still working for the federal government in 94? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1129.1599999999999s)]
*  Uh, my company was the lead financial advisor for the department of housing [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1131.8s)]
*  and urban development, and I was trying to clean up the mortgage corruption. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1136.9199999999998s)]
*  And what I ran smack into is that they were clearly and intentionally setting [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1141.44s)]
*  up the infrastructure to dramatically increase mortgage fraud, intentionally [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1147.96s)]
*  mortgage fraud is a public private partnership between the New York fed [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1153.16s)]
*  member banks and the, and the federal government. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1156.3200000000002s)]
*  So, so the treasury and the fed were clearly engineering a massive new [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1160.52s)]
*  mortgage bubble and essentially I was doing a series of things and, and that [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1165.3600000000001s)]
*  mortgage bubble was going to centralize capital and I was working on a whole plan [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1170.72s)]
*  coming out of the Bush administration. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1175.72s)]
*  We were taking all our profits and investing in building a software [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1177.8s)]
*  infrastructure that would help communities decentralize political and economic power, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1181.8s)]
*  but in a way that would create new great wealth. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1187.76s)]
*  And one of the projects we had was we were working with, uh, I had a subsidiary [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1190.68s)]
*  that had a project working with the top pension fund leaders in the country. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1197.04s)]
*  And, and essentially our job was to figure out how the pension funds could [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1202.56s)]
*  invest so that they could handle this baby boomer demographic going through [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1208.44s)]
*  the pension and retirement system and, um, and, and how we could do it, how they [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1213.48s)]
*  could invest their money cause they're operating at such a size that it would [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1219.72s)]
*  be good for America, you know, how do you build a stronger America? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1223.36s)]
*  In a way that helps the baby boomers, you know, live in retirement. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1227.2s)]
*  And, um, I made a presentation in the spring of 1997 to, we were at a big [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1232.08s)]
*  money management firm outside of Pennsylvania and one of the board members [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1239.72s)]
*  was a money manager who worked with a lot of the pension funds. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1243.68s)]
*  And so we had all these top corporate and state pension fund leaders. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1247.88s)]
*  And I made a presentation. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1251.24s)]
*  We had done a simulation of re-engineering the Philadelphia economy to achieve this. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1252.44s)]
*  And, um, the top pension fund leader looked at me and he said, Oh my God, you [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1258.8400000000001s)]
*  know, this is very similar to what we tried long ago and it didn't work. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1264.04s)]
*  And I said, you didn't have the internet, you didn't have the tools to get the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1267.72s)]
*  average person's learning metabolism high enough, you know, on an economic basis [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1272.52s)]
*  to do that, we had built a data servicing company in low income communities. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1277.1200000000001s)]
*  And we were able to show how easily we could get the labor force or people on [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1281.36s)]
*  welfare, off of welfare and make, making lots of money and being very productive [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1286.6s)]
*  at high speed. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1290.28s)]
*  And, and he looked at me and he said, you don't understand it's too late. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1291.6s)]
*  I said, what do you mean it's too late? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1296.24s)]
*  He said, they've given up on the country. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1297.84s)]
*  They're moving all the money out starting in the fall. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1300.08s)]
*  He said, you've got to get to Nick Brady. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1303.12s)]
*  Nick had been my, I had been a partner at Dylan Reed and Nick had been the [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1304.84s)]
*  chairman of Dylan Reed before he became secretary of treasury. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1308.32s)]
*  And at that point, Nick is out, but you know, sort of involved. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1311.12s)]
*  Anyway, he said, you've got to get to Nick and let him know it's not hopeless. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1315.08s)]
*  This can all be turned around. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1318.1599999999999s)]
*  And, and I thought he meant we, the pension funds have been instructed to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1320.12s)]
*  reinvest equity and reallocate our equity into the emerging markets, which [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1326.08s)]
*  made sense because they had a much higher growth rate. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1330.72s)]
*  Um, what I didn't realize then was, and I realized shortly thereafter in October [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1333.56s)]
*  of 1997, that's the beginning of the 1998 fiscal year, huge, enormous amounts [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1340.8799999999999s)]
*  of money started, started disappearing from the U S government. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1347.48s)]
*  And literally, um, by the time of nine 11, there was 4.1 trillion missing from [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1351.52s)]
*  DOD and HUD. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1358.76s)]
*  And if you remember the day before nine 11, Donna Rumsfeld stood up and, and [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1360.24s)]
*  basically said, he, he did a press conference and he said there's 2.3 [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1365.04s)]
*  trillion in undocumented adjustments last year at DOD and we're missing money. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1369.52s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's worse than terrorism. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1374.0s)]
*  And then of course, I was working with a reporter on a huge story that would [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1376.88s)]
*  have published that Friday after nine 11 about the missing money. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1381.0s)]
*  We'd been working on it for over a year and she'd done nine stories. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1384.6000000000001s)]
*  I'd helped her do nine stories because we were trying to get the general accounting [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1388.36s)]
*  office, um, now that now they call it to the general accountability office, but [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1391.76s)]
*  we were trying to get both Congress and the GAO to do something about it and to [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1397.6799999999998s)]
*  try and stop it. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1403.32s)]
*  And, um, anyway, as you know, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1404.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1408.1599999999999s)]
*  Priorities changed. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1408.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1409.76s)]
*  Um, for reasons that we still don't understand. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1410.0s)]
*  And there was no, well, I don't think the average person, the average [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1412.84s)]
*  person, I think sort of thinks, well, maybe there were 19 guys from Saudi or [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1418.28s)]
*  something. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1422.68s)]
*  I call the Patriot act that the control and concentration of cashflow act, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1423.32s)]
*  because what, one of the things that happened after nine 11, if you, if you [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1427.76s)]
*  look at the history of the black budget and sort of secret financing that the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1432.48s)]
*  government uses for secret and classified projects, that pot of money had grown and [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1436.72s)]
*  grown and grown and it, it had become very dysfunctional to try and get that [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1441.56s)]
*  money mortgage fraud to, I believe was one of the biggest sources. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1446.24s)]
*  And that's why what I was doing sort of went into the heart of the problem. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1450.44s)]
*  But, um, uh, the Patriot act and that whole process was very successful at [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1454.16s)]
*  moving a lot more money onto the budget. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1462.04s)]
*  In other words, it made it much easier to get enormous amounts of money for the [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1466.04s)]
*  national security state, um, as a result of what happened now, you know, whenever [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1470.16s)]
*  you do an operation like this, you stack function. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1476.0s)]
*  So it's only one of many goals, but it was very successful. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1478.16s)]
*  We went all went right over my head. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1482.0s)]
*  Um, I thought it was all about Muhammad. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1483.96s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1485.76s)]
*  I know you're laughing. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1487.04s)]
*  Um, I want to tell you my church story. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1487.92s)]
*  Wait, hold on. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1490.4s)]
*  There's so many threads here. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1491.36s)]
*  Um, yeah, there's a lot of threads. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1492.8s)]
*  Yeah, there's a lot of threads. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1494.36s)]
*  I just want to, I don't want to let it continue to hang in the air. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1495.2s)]
*  This question of space. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1498.56s)]
*  You sort of threw that out parenthetically, but like, well, I've never heard that [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1500.24s)]
*  before. So you believe going back 30 years that people in the U S government and in [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1503.04s)]
*  the finance world wanted money for. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1508.2s)]
*  Yeah, it wasn't just go. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1510.72s)]
*  It was the central banking. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1511.8s)]
*  If you look at the center, if you look at the group of people who meet through the [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1513.6s)]
*  BIS, the bank, the BIS is the bank of international settlements and it's the [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1516.6s)]
*  central bank of central banks. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1523.12s)]
*  Where is that looking? [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1524.36s)]
*  It's in Basel, Switzerland. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1525.12s)]
*  And, um, it has 63 of the most powerful, uh, central banks as its members and the [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1526.88s)]
*  New York fed and the fed are both shareholders. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1534.3200000000002s)]
*  They became shareholders in 1994. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1536.48s)]
*  In one sentence, what's the, what's the purpose of the bank of international [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1538.88s)]
*  settlements? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1542.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1542.4s)]
*  So there are two things you need to know about the bank of international settlements. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1542.72s)]
*  I'm not sure my brain's big enough for this, but keep going. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1545.8000000000002s)]
*  It is. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1547.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1548.16s)]
*  It has sovereign immunity. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1549.48s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1552.68s)]
*  It's above the law. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1553.52s)]
*  It's its own country. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1554.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1555.68s)]
*  It's its own country. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1556.04s)]
*  It has its own police force. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1556.92s)]
*  And essentially other than one of its staff being in a car accident or, you [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1558.64s)]
*  know, minor things, no one has the legal authority to move against it. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1562.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  And a sovereign immunity. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1569.64s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1570.68s)]
*  Number two, it can move money and hold it on its bank, uh, on its balance [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1572.4s)]
*  sheet and manage money secretly. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1578.16s)]
*  So if I want to, I'm, and I'm grossly oversimplifying. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1581.64s)]
*  If I want to steal 21 trillion from the U S government and park it on the [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1584.32s)]
*  balance sheet of the BIS, it can move it anywhere in the world and it can keep [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1589.56s)]
*  it on its balance sheet secretly. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1593.3999999999999s)]
*  Why would there be an organizational, first of all, where does its power, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1597.48s)]
*  like who empowered it to have sovereign immunity in the right? [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1601.36s)]
*  It was created after world war one and, and, and sort of collected its powers [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1604.36s)]
*  and got going in the thirties. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1609.6799999999998s)]
*  And it was created in theory to manage the reparations of the German government. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1611.08s)]
*  But if you read the real history, it was because the bank of England and the [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1616.2s)]
*  central bankers wanted an entity that had sovereign immunity, they wanted to [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1619.76s)]
*  be able to move money secretly. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1625.1599999999999s)]
*  So for example, if you look at what happened during world war two and all the [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1627.56s)]
*  money that was moving back and forth between the Germans and Americans, you [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1630.92s)]
*  know, Dulles was over in Switzerland helping to match these, all these transfers [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1635.72s)]
*  back and forth. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1641.0s)]
*  So there's a wonderful book called the tower of Basel by a wonderful Hungarian [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1641.96s)]
*  journalist where he documents and describes the whole history of the bank [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1646.6s)]
*  of international settlements. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1650.72s)]
*  And if you want to understand power in this world, understanding the, how the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1651.76s)]
*  bank of international settlements and the, and the plumbing of the central banking [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1656.84s)]
*  system works is very, very important. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1660.24s)]
*  I've always been worried that if I knew more, that I would become mentally ill. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1664.08s)]
*  No. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1668.36s)]
*  No. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1669.36s)]
*  So I just have to say that reality is sort of the door that you open to find [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1669.8s)]
*  real solutions. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1678.08s)]
*  So there are real solutions and the biggest obstacle to implementing them is [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1679.6s)]
*  nobody wants to face it. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1684.32s)]
*  So I used to have a pastor who would say- [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1686.12s)]
*  Nobody wants to face the truth of how things actually work. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1687.52s)]
*  Nobody wants to face the truth. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1689.12s)]
*  And I understand that because the hardest thing I ever had to do, Tucker, was look [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1690.8s)]
*  in the mirror and say, I'm the Patsy. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1695.2s)]
*  I was the assistant secretary of housing. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1697.4s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1700.44s)]
*  And I went along and I didn't face this. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1701.48s)]
*  I should have seen this faster. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1703.84s)]
*  I should have said, I'm the Patsy. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1705.24s)]
*  And it was, it's sometimes it's harder than facing death to admit that you've [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1707.72s)]
*  been part of, you know, a big lie and you've been tricked. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1713.28s)]
*  As someone who advocated for the Iraq war on television, I, I've lived this to [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1717.64s)]
*  some extent. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1721.04s)]
*  Oh no. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1721.48s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1722.12s)]
*  Well, you know, part of facing this is you have to forgive yourself. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1722.72s)]
*  You really have to, but I used to have a pastor who would say, if we can face it, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1727.4s)]
*  God can fix it because you have to understand we can't fix it. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1732.2s)]
*  There are many, many things we can do to change the course. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1735.88s)]
*  And I believe ultimately freedom can prevail and there's many things we can do [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1740.68s)]
*  to help that happen, but ultimately this is a spiritual war and you have to call [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1744.96s)]
*  on God, you have to call on the divine. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1751.64s)]
*  And that's where the battle is ultimately going to be decided. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1754.04s)]
*  And that means literally, I believe this is true. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1758.04s)]
*  The divine intelligence cannot go to work unless we're willing to face it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1762.12s)]
*  You know, we have to look at it. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1766.52s)]
*  We have to pray. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1768.24s)]
*  We have to ask for help and we have to deal with it. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1769.6s)]
*  And the solutions, the real solutions will be cultural. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1772.76s)]
*  There'll be millions of people acting in their own life, refusing to be [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1776.24s)]
*  controlled individually. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1780.84s)]
*  So very, very wise what you just said. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1784.36s)]
*  I think it's true. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1787.28s)]
*  And thank you for saying that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1788.32s)]
*  I want to just go one more time to the space question. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1790.9199999999998s)]
*  So you said that people with power at the central banks decided that we need to [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1793.96s)]
*  sort of colonize space or move towards space. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1801.48s)]
*  Did that happen? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1805.1599999999999s)]
*  So here's what happened. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1806.84s)]
*  And we have two wrap ups and I think I sent them to you. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1808.84s)]
*  One is we published in 2015 called Space Here We Go and it's got a picture of a [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1811.28s)]
*  businessman, you know, taking off in a spaceship. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1816.6399999999999s)]
*  And then we, in 2017, after a couple of the big investment banks wrote big things [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1820.24s)]
*  about space investment, we wrote one called The Space-Based Economy. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1825.52s)]
*  And then we track space on Salir Report. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  So I would refer you to that. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1832.6799999999998s)]
*  But I think, you know, first of all, you've seen a lot of capital centralized into a [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1835.3200000000002s)]
*  few billionaires who then reinvest that money in space. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1846.76s)]
*  So Musk, Bezos, you know, so clearly there's a centralization of capital and a [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1851.68s)]
*  reinvestment. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1857.68s)]
*  So the idea of space is what, I mean, just the biggest possible picture. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1859.0s)]
*  Why would you be interested in space? [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1863.6s)]
*  I say this as someone who's not. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1865.6399999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1867.24s)]
*  So, so let me give you a couple of reasons why. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1867.6399999999999s)]
*  First of all, you're looking for, the miners are looking for a variety of [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1870.12s)]
*  different resources. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1875.1599999999999s)]
*  So there are practical reasons if you can get the costs down that you would want to [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1876.72s)]
*  do asteroid mining. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1880.6799999999998s)]
*  The big one, the big economic one is control is most easily implemented by [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1883.0s)]
*  satellites. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1888.28s)]
*  So you want to put up a whole ring of satellites that combined with [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1889.48s)]
*  telecommunications can basically help run the control grid. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1894.12s)]
*  And not just the control grid in the West, the control grid, if you're going to [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1898.2s)]
*  shift huge amounts of money globally, how are you going to track and enforce that [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1903.04s)]
*  your money is being properly invested? [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1908.72s)]
*  Well, you need a control grid globally. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1911.12s)]
*  So I think that's part of it. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1913.24s)]
*  The last thing, and I don't know the answer to this, is I think there is real [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1915.0800000000002s)]
*  concerned about geophysical risks. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1919.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1922.2s)]
*  And one way to deal with that is to make sure we don't bet the [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1922.96s)]
*  ranch on one planet. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1927.1200000000001s)]
*  So to that, if we could just linger on that, thank you for that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1929.28s)]
*  That'll make sense. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1932.6000000000001s)]
*  If we just linger on one question, so geophysical risks. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1934.4s)]
*  So we've been lectured for, I don't know, 30 years now about climate change. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1937.28s)]
*  Climate change is obviously an ongoing feature of life on this planet. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1941.2399999999998s)]
*  The glaciers. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1945.3999999999999s)]
*  It's just an op. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1945.8s)]
*  So of course it's an op. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1947.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think we, you know, people have figured that out. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1949.9199999999998s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that smart, highly informed people aren't worried about [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1954.7199999999998s)]
*  geophysical risks. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1960.8s)]
*  They are. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1961.6799999999998s)]
*  And I know some of them. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1962.1999999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1962.9599999999998s)]
*  So what do you think those risks are that honest, smart people who are interested [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1963.9199999999998s)]
*  in self-preservation and thriving, like what are the risks they're worried about? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1969.08s)]
*  So I think, I think the first is a solar minimum where you get big drops in the [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1972.72s)]
*  economy and the agriculture and you can't feed the population. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1978.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1982.1999999999998s)]
*  So. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1982.8799999999999s)]
*  Because there are changes in climate because of the distance of the earth from [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1983.28s)]
*  the sun, and that changes. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1986.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1988.3999999999999s)]
*  So we know throughout history, we go through periods of solar minimum. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1988.6399999999999s)]
*  Solar minimum is the name. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1991.8799999999999s)]
*  I think it's called solar minimum. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1993.52s)]
*  I'm not an expert in any of this. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1995.1599999999999s)]
*  So. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1997.1599999999999s)]
*  So they are worried about climate change, but they don't think it's coming from your [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=1998.76s)]
*  suburban. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2001.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2002.48s)]
*  It's not coming from human behavior. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2002.76s)]
*  Now there are environmental problems coming from human behavior. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2004.6399999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2007.84s)]
*  And those are. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2008.24s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2008.6799999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2009.1999999999998s)]
*  So, so, so, so that's one. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2010.0s)]
*  And do you think that risk is real? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2013.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2015.52s)]
*  For the record, I have one friend who's very well informed, who has convinced me [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2017.0s)]
*  that that is real, that they're, that they're very concerned about water. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2021.9199999999998s)]
*  If, if you look at the history, you know, of solar minimums and you look at what it [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2026.36s)]
*  does to, you know, there was a Russian, I can't remember if he was an economist or [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2032.0s)]
*  science that did a lot of research on the stock market and solar activity, you know, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2036.84s)]
*  and the, the, if you're the central bankers and you're in charge of managing the [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2041.2s)]
*  financial system, that, that reality would make me very nervous. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2045.08s)]
*  So. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2050.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2051.96s)]
*  So I think, I, you know, I think there's something there worth understanding. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2052.52s)]
*  The other thing is every, it appears to me, if you go back through history, every [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2055.92s)]
*  10,000, 12,000 years, we have, you know, some kind of huge disaster, an extinction [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2060.92s)]
*  event, an extinction, a near extinction event. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2066.7599999999998s)]
*  So I don't know if you've ever read the science fiction book, three body problem. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2069.7999999999997s)]
*  No, it's fascinating. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2073.48s)]
*  It's a, one of the tops Chinese science fiction. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2074.96s)]
*  Uh, and, and it's about, um, uh, I've read no Chinese science fiction. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2078.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2083.72s)]
*  I'm feeling very ignorant this morning. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2086.24s)]
*  No, no, no, no, because I, here's the thing. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2088.0s)]
*  I'm just trying to figure out what in the world's going on. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2090.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2092.36s)]
*  Amen. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2092.52s)]
*  We'll start in the same place. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2092.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2094.08s)]
*  So that always, as you know, that always leads you to the most. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2094.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2098.08s)]
*  It does. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2098.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2099.08s)]
*  So in one, I think it was, I think the thing that got me to read three body problem [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2099.84s)]
*  was, um, Obama made some cryptic comment about people ought to read this book. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2103.84s)]
*  It was like, can't hint, you know, here are the problems I'm dealing with. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2109.7599999999998s)]
*  And the three body problem is about, um, uh, uh, other bodies that come into the [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2113.84s)]
*  solar system and you is there, it's impossible to predict their trajectory. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2120.68s)]
*  And then when they do, they create this catastrophic flooding and earthquakes [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2126.84s)]
*  and all this other stuff anyway. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2130.48s)]
*  But, but I think that there, whether it's a pole shift magnetic pole shift is one [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2132.28s)]
*  of the, you know, theories of what causes these events. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2137.56s)]
*  Um, but there is a history of near extinction events. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2141.56s)]
*  And one of the things that I've looked at, because I'm trying to figure out, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2144.88s)]
*  you know, when, between 19, uh, fiscal 1998 and fiscal 2015, there were 21 [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2148.92s)]
*  trillion of undocumented adjustments in the U S government. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2156.32s)]
*  If you go to our website, missing money.saliher.com, we have years and years [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2159.92s)]
*  of documentation, including the government financials that show this. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2164.4s)]
*  And so the question is, where's all this money going? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2168.2799999999997s)]
*  And one of the things I've looked at in the process of looking at where all [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2171.12s)]
*  this money is going is the underground base and city infrastructure and [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2175.24s)]
*  transportation system that's been built. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2181.08s)]
*  And I'm sorry. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2183.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2185.04s)]
*  So, so we have built an extraordinary number of underground bases and [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2185.6s)]
*  supposedly transportation systems. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2192.0s)]
*  Some of these are a record of some of these are documented as part of the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2194.36s)]
*  national security infrastructure. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2198.72s)]
*  I think there are many more. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2200.96s)]
*  So, um, in the United States, in the United States on all over the world. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2202.4s)]
*  But, um, in, uh, from 2021 to 2023, I took one of the smartest subscribers in [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2207.48s)]
*  the Salir report network, and he and I spent two years collecting all the data. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2217.64s)]
*  And all the allegations on underground basis. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2224.24s)]
*  And then we, um, we systematically went through and tried to estimate our guess. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2227.4s)]
*  This is totally a guess of how many underground bases, both underground [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2233.92s)]
*  in the United States, but also underground under the ocean around the United States. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2238.76s)]
*  And our estimate was 170 with the transportation network connecting them. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2244.56s)]
*  And what would be the purpose? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2250.72s)]
*  The purpose, if you thought you were going to get a near extinction event. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2253.04s)]
*  So, so there, to me, there are two purposes. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2257.04s)]
*  You have so many activities going on that you need to keep secret that you're [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2259.16s)]
*  basically building the capacity to, for example, if you're doing a secret space [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2263.84s)]
*  program, you need to platform it from, you know, things that can't be seen. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2268.48s)]
*  But I think if you're worried about a near extinction event, you know, that's. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2273.2799999999997s)]
*  So I know nothing about this other than my only [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2280.12s)]
*  window into it. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2282.0s)]
*  Um, I knew a contractor who worked on one in Washington, in the city of Washington, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2283.2s)]
*  DC, and, um, I remember him telling me about a power box, like a transformer box [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2286.76s)]
*  on constitution avenue that he told me, cause he worked on it personally, uh, was [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2294.84s)]
*  actually the exit, the egress from White House that was kind of by vehicle. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2300.88s)]
*  I thought that was, I was like, really? [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2306.92s)]
*  He goes, oh yeah, no, I, I installed it. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2308.76s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2310.84s)]
*  And I thought, well, that's kind of crazy. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2312.2s)]
*  Then the middle of this big city where I live, I lived in that I was on [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2313.92s)]
*  constitution avenue every day that you could build something like that without [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2316.56s)]
*  me knowing it under the VP's house at the Naval observatory, same thing. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2319.76s)]
*  I think most people know that next to my brother's house on McComb street in DC. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2324.48s)]
*  So also, so like, but that's, I always thought that was like preparation for [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2329.76s)]
*  nuclear war, like I didn't really think about it that much. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2334.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2336.56s)]
*  It's it's preparation for catastrophe. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2337.16s)]
*  So, but you think that there are facilities like that in other places outside DC? [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2339.8799999999997s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2344.7999999999997s)]
*  So if you're interested, we have a great interview. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2346.08s)]
*  I did an interview of Richard Dolan on underground basis on the ciliary report [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2348.6s)]
*  and it's sort of an introduction to the topic and it's based on a lot of the [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2352.7599999999998s)]
*  research of a guy named Richard Souter, who is very hard to interview. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  So Richard kind of went through all the material and, and, um, you know, clearly [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2361.4799999999996s)]
*  it's, I don't know if you ever saw Washington Post did a project, it was in [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2367.64s)]
*  2010 or 12 called top secret America. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2372.6s)]
*  And one of the reporters, it was a team of two reporters. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2376.64s)]
*  One of them put together a database of all the different top secret installations [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2379.3599999999997s)]
*  that had been built in the country, including since the Patriot act. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2384.8399999999997s)]
*  And what you saw was just this explosion of money and building so many both [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2390.44s)]
*  underground and above ground facilities. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2396.8s)]
*  Not all sleep aids are made by pharmaceutical companies. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2399.1600000000003s)]
*  You probably heard about eight sleep by now. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2401.88s)]
*  They develop the country's most innovative products for sleep. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2404.04s)]
*  Almost everybody in our office uses something they make called the pod and [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2407.6000000000004s)]
*  they love it and there's a reason that professional athletes and lots of other [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2411.28s)]
*  smart people do too, you add the pod to your mattress, like a mattress cover, and [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2414.28s)]
*  it helps you get a better night's sleep and fill with vitality at the start of [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2418.4s)]
*  each day in an intimidating way. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2421.76s)]
*  Almost it's amazing. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2423.2400000000002s)]
*  How does it do it? [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2425.52s)]
*  Well, it uses advanced technology to track your sleep and automatically adjust [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2426.08s)]
*  the temperature of your side of the bed to what's perfect for sleep and [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2430.08s)]
*  temperature makes all the difference. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2435.08s)]
*  It's backed by over 600 million hours of data. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2436.64s)]
*  They've also used those insights to create their new product, sleep elixir to [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2440.24s)]
*  help you get quiet before you go to bed, fall asleep faster and stay knocked out [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2443.2s)]
*  longer, no grogginess, no weird side effects, just better deep sleep. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2448.48s)]
*  So if you're ready to take sleep and recovery to the next level, go to [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2452.0s)]
*  eight sleep.com slash Tucker to get 350 bucks off your pod for ultra full [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2455.0s)]
*  refund for 30 days. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2460.4s)]
*  If you don't love it, it works just as a theological matter. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2462.2s)]
*  I hate to say this, but I think it's true. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2467.2400000000002s)]
*  If you're building a lot underground, you're on the wrong side. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2470.08s)]
*  I just don't, I don't think that's a good sign. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2475.76s)]
*  So I'll tell you very right. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2477.68s)]
*  Like, God, just like, let's just the obvious first. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2480.36s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2483.36s)]
*  So I'll tell you a very funny story. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2484.56s)]
*  Um, so in, uh, after I left the administration, uh, after I left the [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2487.64s)]
*  Bush administration, I went on the board of Sallie Mae and, um, I'm on the [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2493.56s)]
*  board of Sallie Mae and after one of the first meetings, there was a wonderful [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2498.2s)]
*  stop. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2501.12s)]
*  I don't, I, you've been talking about underground bases and colonizing space [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2501.52s)]
*  and you clearly seem totally sane, but I'm sure some people are like, well, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2505.3199999999997s)]
*  she's obviously crazy. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2508.96s)]
*  I should have set the stage at the beginning with your biography. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2510.4s)]
*  Like you're as mainstream, you're on the board of Sallie Mae, Sallie Mae, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2514.0s)]
*  you're a partner at Dylan Reed. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2517.8s)]
*  It's like, you're not just like on the internet. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2518.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2524.44s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2524.7200000000003s)]
*  I just want to say, I just want to say that this is like a former high level [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2525.08s)]
*  federal official who's on the board of Sallie Mae and a partner at Dylan Reed. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2529.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2532.92s)]
*  Just want to say that out loud. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2533.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2534.04s)]
*  So, so I'm on the board and there was a lovely chairman, a really lovely guy. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2534.6800000000003s)]
*  And he comes up, he says, can I talk to you after the meeting? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2540.0s)]
*  And I said, sure. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2543.08s)]
*  And he pulls out this big glossy brochure for the council on foreign relations. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2544.52s)]
*  And he said, the time has come for you to join. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2549.36s)]
*  And he said, we want you to ask Nick, Nick Brady to sponsor you. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2551.92s)]
*  And I said to him, you know, Sam, I just don't want to do this. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2556.8s)]
*  I just, I really don't want to do this. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2560.1600000000003s)]
*  And he looked shocked and he said, you don't understand if you don't do this, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2563.08s)]
*  you're out forever. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2566.6400000000003s)]
*  And just at that moment, just at that moment, you know, it's, it's these [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2568.52s)]
*  moments when things come to you. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2573.08s)]
*  I saw in my mind, I'm very pictorial. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2575.04s)]
*  I saw in my mind a locker in the underground base and they were taking my [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2577.32s)]
*  name off of the locker. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2582.04s)]
*  And I thought, I thought, you know, if it comes to that, I'll take my [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2585.4s)]
*  chances upstairs with the way of life. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2589.92s)]
*  Yeah, me too. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2592.04s)]
*  And I said, but it's this, it's a, you know, something it's at the deepest [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2592.8s)]
*  root, it's a spiritual and cultural question. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2597.04s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2598.88s)]
*  Who's cowering underground, like in the dark places? [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2600.08s)]
*  No. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2603.56s)]
*  There's, but to me, there's nothing wrong with going into a bunker if they're [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2604.64s)]
*  bombing, okay, you know, I don't have a problem with that, but I, I really [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2608.84s)]
*  didn't want to be with all of them in a concentrated space. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2613.48s)]
*  It was like, no, I'd rather. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2617.36s)]
*  And you know them at this is you're not guessing at this. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2619.48s)]
*  Like you know a lot of these people. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2621.72s)]
*  I know a lot of these people. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2623.68s)]
*  And the one thing I will have to say, if there's anything I learned from my [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2625.04s)]
*  history, the problem is not they are bad and we are good. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2628.7599999999998s)]
*  That's not how this works. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2634.2s)]
*  The evil in the good is threaded at every level of society, every [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2636.48s)]
*  community, every enterprise. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2640.92s)]
*  It doesn't work like that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2642.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm not especially good. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2644.64s)]
*  I know that I know that for a fact. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2645.72s)]
*  So I think you're pretty good. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2647.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2649.84s)]
*  But of course, you know more about yourself than anyone else does. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2650.08s)]
*  And I know that what a flawed person I am. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2652.76s)]
*  So I'll never declare myself on, on, you know, I'll never say God's on my side. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2654.32s)]
*  I'll say, I want to be on God's side, but it's an open question. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2660.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, it's a journey. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2663.96s)]
*  It's never over. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2665.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2665.96s)]
*  And, and we're not perfect and it's, you try every day to do as good as you can. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2666.48s)]
*  You know, and it's like baseball, you get some hits some days and [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2671.92s)]
*  some days you strike out. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2674.48s)]
*  So, but you believe that there's a whole constellation of underground bases [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2676.76s)]
*  built by the U S government. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2680.76s)]
*  In the United States, like that fact alone, just the physical [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2683.1600000000003s)]
*  infrastructure of it, because normally we talk about what are they doing? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2686.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, it's unbelievable. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2690.7200000000003s)]
*  And like it raises lots of practical questions. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2691.92s)]
*  How do you ventilate them? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2693.6000000000004s)]
*  What about food and water supply? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2694.36s)]
*  You know, where's the energy? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2695.88s)]
*  Are we using breakthrough energy or where's the energy come? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2697.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2700.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2702.0800000000004s)]
*  Because I'm sure that we have the ability to, to produce [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2702.32s)]
*  breakthrough energy at very low cost. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2707.48s)]
*  You know, if you go back, why are you sure of that? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2709.7200000000003s)]
*  Um, my Dutch partners, uh, I met because they were doing a series of [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2712.44s)]
*  conferences on breakthrough energy. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2717.7999999999997s)]
*  And they brought together breakthrough energy inventors from around the world. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2720.04s)]
*  And you know, you can see all the videos up on the internet and, and really [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2724.24s)]
*  went through the history from Tesla on of different inventors who have discovered [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2728.56s)]
*  and claimed different innovations with breakthrough energy. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2733.56s)]
*  And I'm convinced that this energy exists. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2736.3599999999997s)]
*  And I'm also convinced if you look at a lot of the really fast ships, you know, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2739.6s)]
*  flying around the planet, you know, that they, you know, they're not using [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2744.7599999999998s)]
*  classical electricity, right? [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2750.2799999999997s)]
*  So, so, you know, they're not running in diesel. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2754.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2757.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2758.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2759.12s)]
*  So, um, yeah. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2759.88s)]
*  So we know that these, I'm sorry to, I get so caught up in the details, but we [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2763.64s)]
*  know that there are quite a number of large underground bases in the United States. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2768.24s)]
*  We can state that as fact. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2772.8399999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2774.24s)]
*  And then the question becomes, of course, like if they're connected to the power [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2775.56s)]
*  grid, you know, if they're pulling off just a conventional natural gas, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2778.4399999999996s)]
*  electricity generation station, you could like know that measure it, but you [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2783.7599999999998s)]
*  think they have independent energy sources. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2787.08s)]
*  Of course they do. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2788.52s)]
*  So one of the, one of the questions I have that I think is really important is [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2789.12s)]
*  when you look at breakthrough energy, if you are running the planet. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2795.24s)]
*  So I have this nickname for the committee at the top, Mr. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2800.16s)]
*  Global, if you were Mr. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2803.3199999999997s)]
*  Global, you would not want to implement breakthrough energy on a widespread [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2805.0s)]
*  basis for a variety of reasons. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2809.64s)]
*  One of which is everybody got ahold of it and weaponized it. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2811.12s)]
*  It could be very dangerous. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2814.3999999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2815.7599999999998s)]
*  Um, my understanding is that, um, uh, literally one small group of people could [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2816.9199999999996s)]
*  take this, you know, with no sovereign powers or, you know, just organize crime [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2823.48s)]
*  and use it in a way that could weaponize it and make it very dangerous. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2828.76s)]
*  I don't, I, I'm not a scientist. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2832.36s)]
*  I don't really understand. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2834.28s)]
*  Energy by definition is dangerous. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2835.4s)]
*  You know, gasoline is dangerous, right? [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2836.92s)]
*  Electricity is dangerous. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2839.2s)]
*  Of course, nuclear energy is dangerous. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2840.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2841.92s)]
*  But if you're, if you're, if you're the risk manager and you're [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2842.2s)]
*  charged with managing the planet, you know, this has more disruption capability, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2844.72s)]
*  both weaponization, economic. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2850.8s)]
*  You know, suddenly everybody's free to do whatever they want. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2853.28s)]
*  And so they're much harder to control. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2855.8s)]
*  So, so if you're Mr. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2858.16s)]
*  Global and you have the capacity, dramatically lower the energy cost, the [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2859.84s)]
*  other danger is then population skyrockets and you, you're concerned about that. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2865.12s)]
*  So if you're Mr. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2870.6s)]
*  Global and you're worried about what will happen, if you bring this technology out, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2871.64s)]
*  it's very convenient to get complete control. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2875.76s)]
*  If you don't trust the population to be environmentally responsible or [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2878.24s)]
*  politically responsible, then complete control. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2883.6s)]
*  So I have a, we have a good mutual friend who's been bothering [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2887.08s)]
*  me for years to interview you. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2889.88s)]
*  You've got to interview her. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2891.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, just cause she's, he said, this is like the best informed, smartest, most [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2894.16s)]
*  reasonable mainstream sane person I know of you. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2898.12s)]
*  He said this and I was like, yeah, okay. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2902.24s)]
*  Anyway, and we're just really glad we did this interview because you're [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2904.16s)]
*  blowing my mind up and down. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2906.52s)]
*  So how convinced are you that breakthrough energy, alternate forms of energy, [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2907.48s)]
*  non-publicly disclosed forms of energy are in use by the US government? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2912.52s)]
*  I think there's a very high chance that, that they're in some kind of use in a [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2920.7999999999997s)]
*  very controlled secret way. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2926.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2928.48s)]
*  Well, there are tons of indications and you've had, right. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2928.68s)]
*  Like at the contractor level, like I'm a federal contractor, electrician, or a, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2931.56s)]
*  you know, concrete guy or whatever. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2936.44s)]
*  And I was working on this underground facility. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2937.96s)]
*  There are a number of people who come forward to say this. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2939.96s)]
*  And I saw, appeared to be some brand new form of energy. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2941.8s)]
*  I didn't understand insane people too. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2945.68s)]
*  Sean Ryan, who's a friend of mine, wonderful guy, honest man, who's a [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2948.8s)]
*  podcaster interviewed, did an interview with this guy. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2952.28s)]
*  It was just like a, it was like a, it was like a, it was like a [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2954.68s)]
*  just a random blue collar guy. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2958.08s)]
*  I think he was a concrete guy, you know, and he got a call for a million yards of [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2960.6s)]
*  concrete or whatever, and went to this underground facility, DOD facility and [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2965.16s)]
*  saw clearly signs of some energy source that was, you know, defied the laws of [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2968.92s)]
*  known physics. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2976.16s)]
*  So, and there are a bunch of people have said stuff like that. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2976.84s)]
*  So I don't think it's crazy. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2979.16s)]
*  So I have a, one of, I have two businesses. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2979.96s)]
*  One is the celeriac part, the other is celeriac screens. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2982.28s)]
*  I do an interview with a guy who's a podcast. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2984.6s)]
*  I do an interview with celeriac screens. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2986.8s)]
*  I do an investment screen. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2987.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think, you know, a lot has to shift in investment if we're going to have a [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2989.44s)]
*  real civilization and not misallocate. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2993.7200000000003s)]
*  I think we're misallocating capital terribly anyway, but he, he for 30 years [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=2996.4s)]
*  has been an investor in a breakthrough energy company. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3001.36s)]
*  So when you know has been. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3004.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3006.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3006.7200000000003s)]
*  And, and it's called brilliant light. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3007.28s)]
*  You can go look at their website, you know, and, and they're really, you know, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3008.92s)]
*  they swear they've got it. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3013.84s)]
*  And what is it? [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3016.84s)]
*  Don't ask me. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3019.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3020.5600000000004s)]
*  You got to get him on and. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3021.5600000000004s)]
*  So, um, you think this money has been taken by people who've really thought [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3022.96s)]
*  through the future and are determined to survive it. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3030.96s)]
*  So I think I call it a financial coup. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3033.5200000000004s)]
*  I think what happened was when the budget deal busted in 1995, they gave up on the [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3036.8s)]
*  government, they just said, you know, this form of government will not work as a [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3046.72s)]
*  governance structure to manage the dollar system. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3052.56s)]
*  They're right about that. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3055.8399999999997s)]
*  And, and, you know, they just felt it was impossible. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3057.3199999999997s)]
*  If you're a risk manager, you got to turn the aircraft carrier before you [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3061.6s)]
*  hit the iceberg and that could be 20 years before, do you know what I mean? [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3066.16s)]
*  And they just felt that the system wasn't working and it required to get [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3070.52s)]
*  consensus, you just had to dumb people down and buy them off. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3076.16s)]
*  And it just wasn't working. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3079.08s)]
*  So I think they decided, okay, we're going to re-engineer government on the [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3081.0s)]
*  just do it method. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3084.6s)]
*  And the first thing we're going to do is we're going to pull all the money out. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3085.52s)]
*  We're going to put the government in a debt trap and then we'll squeeze it and [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3089.7599999999998s)]
*  shift to the control model. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3093.44s)]
*  And it was a financial coup and it started in fiscal 1998. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3095.2s)]
*  So it started literally October 1st, 1997. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3099.2s)]
*  By 2015, they had had 21, we had reports in their financials of 21 trillion of [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3102.72s)]
*  undocumented adjustments from a cash standpoint, you know, that could be 50. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3109.52s)]
*  It could be 50 trillion or 10 trillion. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3114.88s)]
*  There's no way to tell unless you can get access to the bank records. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3117.0s)]
*  And then what happened was Dr. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3120.7999999999997s)]
*  Mark Skidmore of Michigan State University. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3123.7999999999997s)]
*  And I published a study, sort of a survey we had done thanks to him and his [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3126.0s)]
*  students that announced that we were up to the 21 trillion. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3131.16s)]
*  At that point, then the next step that happened, remember the Kavanaugh hearings? [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3137.2s)]
*  Very well. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3141.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3141.72s)]
*  What you don't remember is during the Kavanaugh hearings, the White House, the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3142.3999999999996s)]
*  Senate, the House, Republican and Democrat, all of them together, instituted, issued [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3148.92s)]
*  an administrative policy called Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3157.08s)]
*  Statement 56. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I did miss that. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3163.04s)]
*  I'll just say. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3164.0s)]
*  You did miss that. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3164.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3164.92s)]
*  I was busy watching Kavanaugh yell about his teenage drinking or whatever. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3165.2s)]
*  And what that policy said is as a matter of administrative policy, we do not have [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3169.0s)]
*  to obey the constitutional provisions related to financial budgeting and [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3175.44s)]
*  disclosure, we do not have to obey the laws and we do not have to obey the [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3179.7999999999997s)]
*  regulations. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3184.72s)]
*  What we can do is appoint a secret group of people by a secret process to move [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3185.92s)]
*  money out of the financial disclosures of the United States and 150, so it's the [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3192.36s)]
*  24 covered agencies plus approximately 150 governmental entities. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3199.56s)]
*  And when you throw in the classification laws and the national security laws, it [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3205.52s)]
*  also applies to the big banks and contractors working for the U.S. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3212.36s)]
*  government. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3217.28s)]
*  Now, let me explain what this means as a matter of investment. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3217.7200000000003s)]
*  When I look at the U.S. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3221.28s)]
*  large cap stock market or the U.S. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3223.2400000000002s)]
*  bond market, the treasury market, I have no financial disclosure that has any [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3225.84s)]
*  meaning. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3230.1600000000003s)]
*  Everything's secret. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3231.6400000000003s)]
*  I have no idea what it means. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3233.2000000000003s)]
*  If I pick up the financials of a New York Fed member bank that is running the [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3234.84s)]
*  New York, the U.S. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3240.48s)]
*  Treasury Department's bank accounts, or if I pick up the treasury financial [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3242.12s)]
*  statements, they're meaningless. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3247.7200000000003s)]
*  They don't mean anything. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3248.88s)]
*  What's missing? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3250.48s)]
*  You can't know. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3252.2400000000002s)]
*  All you can know is a secret group of people can move whatever, make whatever [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3253.4s)]
*  they want to go missing and you can't know what it is. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3257.56s)]
*  It's all secret. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3261.2000000000003s)]
*  So I'm looking at half the cake, but I don't know what part of the cake is [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3262.92s)]
*  missing. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3268.68s)]
*  So it's meaningless. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3269.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't even know if it is half. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3272.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3273.44s)]
*  I don't, it's, you know, it has reached a level of absurdity where, and, but, but [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3273.92s)]
*  the absurd thing is as a legal matter to take the position that an administrative [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3282.16s)]
*  policy agreed upon by the uniparty can overrule the constitution, can overrule [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3287.64s)]
*  the laws and can overrule the regulations simply by, you know, like the, you know, [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3295.0s)]
*  you, you wave the wand and suddenly magically law doesn't matter. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3304.4s)]
*  I mean, now you're talking and, and you also saw this in the financial crisis. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3308.16s)]
*  A decision was made by Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to not prosecute [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3313.2s)]
*  HSBC. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3317.68s)]
*  There's a wonderful video on the best evidence channel by John Titus about this [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3319.04s)]
*  whole thing. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3324.28s)]
*  And basically what they said is a systemically important, this is under the [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3324.76s)]
*  BIS, there's a definition under the BIS, under the financial stability board of a [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3331.4s)]
*  financially systemically important institution. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3336.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3339.96s)]
*  These institutions are free to break the law with no, they're free to break the [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3340.8s)]
*  law. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3347.88s)]
*  At most all they have to do is kick back a piece of the profits to the Department [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3348.4s)]
*  of Justice. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3352.04s)]
*  So it's like a formal kickback system. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3352.48s)]
*  And what you're saying is that you're taking the sovereign immunity of the BIS [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3355.08s)]
*  and through the New York Fed extending it to the banks that are running these [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3359.36s)]
*  operations. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3364.08s)]
*  JP Morgan and the rest, Bank of America. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3364.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3366.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3367.08s)]
*  So, so what you're, what you've done with the BIS, the IMF, the World Bank, the [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3368.16s)]
*  UN, you've created all these different organizations. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3373.92s)]
*  And if you look at, we, we did like 40 in Latin America, you've created an [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3378.32s)]
*  international overlay of organizations that have various forms of sovereign [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3382.16s)]
*  immunity, of course, the big one being the BIS. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3387.6s)]
*  And so if they are free to break the law, I mean, if you, if you look at the [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3391.08s)]
*  financial crisis, what you're saying is these companies can lose trillions of [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3395.2799999999997s)]
*  dollars, have it replaced by the taxpayer and keep on going. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3400.04s)]
*  So now is the point of the conversation where I have to ask the obvious question, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3404.36s)]
*  which is who are these people? [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3407.52s)]
*  So can you name some of the people who you believe are making these decisions [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3409.1200000000003s)]
*  whose, whose decisions are effectively, as you just said, above the law have [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3412.7200000000003s)]
*  effective immunity. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3417.7200000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3419.32s)]
*  So, so that's the question sort of who is Mr. Global. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3419.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3422.6s)]
*  And, and my experience is the bureaucracy that, that sort of runs things is the [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3422.8s)]
*  central banking bureaucracy. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3428.0s)]
*  So we've described the BIS and the central bankers. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3429.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3431.92s)]
*  So think of the planet as a house. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3432.12s)]
*  So you have the house, then you have financing the house. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3434.68s)]
*  That's the mortgage. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3438.36s)]
*  Then you have the insurance and you know, if you don't have the insurance, then [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3440.04s)]
*  you're, then you have the equity in the house. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3444.12s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3446.04s)]
*  And, and the insurance layer is very, very important to make sure that [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3446.7999999999997s)]
*  the equity is protected. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3450.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3452.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3453.36s)]
*  So you've got the real assets, you've got the banking system, you've got the [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3454.16s)]
*  insurance system, and then you've got the office. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3457.68s)]
*  And then you've got the insurance system and then you've got the owners. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3460.08s)]
*  So in my experience, if you go to the BIS and you look at the systemically [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3464.48s)]
*  important institutions and the members, you know, that's the bureaucracy that [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3468.04s)]
*  runs the debt and the transaction system. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3472.8s)]
*  So the, you know, the transactions, because the whole thing depends on [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3475.32s)]
*  being able to swap and, and transact. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3479.88s)]
*  The insurance group is very important for the reasons you just described, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3483.84s)]
*  same as on your house. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3487.08s)]
*  The question is who are the real owners? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3488.44s)]
*  And that's the mystery. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3490.84s)]
*  And I've spent my whole life trying to figure out who are the real owners. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3492.16s)]
*  And basically from what experience I've had, if you know their name, they're [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3495.84s)]
*  not one of the important owners. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3501.64s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3504.68s)]
*  It's, it's intergenerational pools of capital. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3505.28s)]
*  Now here's what's interesting. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3508.6s)]
*  One of the most powerful pools of intergenerational capital that I've [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3510.08s)]
*  ever dealt with is the Harvard endowment. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3514.12s)]
*  And if you look at the squabble going on over who controls the [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3517.04s)]
*  Harvard endowment right now, it's a very interesting squabble. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3520.28s)]
*  Can you summarize it? [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3524.76s)]
*  Well, you have, you have the Trump administration and the department of [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3527.4s)]
*  justice now in a lawsuit with Harvard over who has what powers over Harvard's [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3532.7200000000003s)]
*  policies, but I think the big, the big fight is not the, you know, an [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3538.76s)]
*  asymmetrical warfare, the fight is never what the fight's really about. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3544.32s)]
*  The real fight is about who controls the, so Harvard corporation, the [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3548.28s)]
*  university is only a portion of the Harvard corporation. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3556.6000000000004s)]
*  The Harvard corporation runs the university and it runs the endowment. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3560.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3564.96s)]
*  And the Harvard corporation, in my experience, is one of the most important [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3565.32s)]
*  investment syndicates in the world. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3569.1200000000003s)]
*  And because they have a tax exemption, they don't have to pay taxes. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3571.2400000000002s)]
*  They spin off, I think the last time I looked, I don't know what it is [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3575.2000000000003s)]
*  currently, but they spin off about 4% a year for the university, which is [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3578.32s)]
*  a lot cheaper than paying taxes. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3583.0800000000004s)]
*  And it's a great investment because the university provides all sorts of [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3584.6800000000003s)]
*  intellectual and human capital to the investment syndicate, you know, so [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3588.6400000000003s)]
*  it's a very brilliant, elegant model. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3592.2000000000003s)]
*  And my theory is it was the model that was really created to sort of [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3595.5200000000004s)]
*  compete with the Vatican and the Catholics who had 2000 years of, you [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3599.88s)]
*  know, diplomatic immunity and no taxes. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3604.96s)]
*  Anyway, so, so, but it is the Harvard corporation is run by a perpetuating board. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3607.7200000000003s)]
*  So, so the board members, if board member leaves, they pick a new board member. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3614.48s)]
*  So it's a perpetuate, self-perpetuating board. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3618.52s)]
*  And my guess is behind the scenes, if there's a fight, one of the fight is [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3621.4s)]
*  who gets on that board because then you control a $50 billion plus endowment. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3625.48s)]
*  And a $50 billion plus endowment, which now is, has a 39% private equity portfolio. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3631.12s)]
*  And these are, you know, I said to on money and markets, which is our [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3638.2000000000003s)]
*  weekly show, I said the other week, you know, if this is a monopoly board, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3641.52s)]
*  that would be part place because it's such a flagship in the world of [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3644.8s)]
*  investment, it's such a major leader. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3649.44s)]
*  What would happen if the Congress decided to the new tax bill to tax [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3652.48s)]
*  university endowments, which they should do? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3656.64s)]
*  I don't know because, because that will happen at the same time, [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3662.92s)]
*  something else is going to happen. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3667.08s)]
*  And these things are going to happen at the same time. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3671.36s)]
*  The thing that's going to rock the universities is if you look at how much [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3674.12s)]
*  money it costs you as a father to put one child through college, you know, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3680.04s)]
*  you're talking about enormous bills. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3687.2s)]
*  And if you look at how far the universities have gotten away from [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3690.44s)]
*  providing a great education, it's not a good investment. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3695.04s)]
*  So when I was an investment advisor, I used to work with my clients' kids [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3701.68s)]
*  and we would literally do something. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3707.2799999999997s)]
*  We have a learning plan on Solary now that came out of this. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3709.8s)]
*  I would literally make them price time and money for each course they took by [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3713.2400000000002s)]
*  course, and I would basically make them say, look, what do you want to do in [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3720.4s)]
*  this life and what are the skills and tools you need to do it? [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3725.1200000000003s)]
*  And how are we going to go get those tools with the least amount of your time [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3728.6800000000003s)]
*  and the least amount of your parents' money? [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3733.1200000000003s)]
*  How are we going to really, and we would come up with these wild education [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3735.6400000000003s)]
*  plans where they would like, you know, go to San Francisco for this audio [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3739.64s)]
*  video course, and then they would be next year in Budapest studying at the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3743.68s)]
*  university, you know, because you want kids to learn about the world and [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3747.96s)]
*  you want them to be, you know, not provincial stuck in- [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3754.56s)]
*  You want them to be educated. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3758.68s)]
*  Yeah, you want them to be educated. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3759.92s)]
*  Anyway, but we would come up with these very creative things and what you [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3761.7999999999997s)]
*  discover is in a world of YouTube university and access to extraordinary, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3765.32s)]
*  you know, resources all around the world to get a great education, the [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3772.6000000000004s)]
*  universities in the United States have gotten unbelievably bloated and [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3777.6400000000003s)]
*  unbelievably off track. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3782.1200000000003s)]
*  I think everyone senses that. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3784.48s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3786.0800000000004s)]
*  And there are terrible, if you're a loving parent, there are [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3786.76s)]
*  terrible investment. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3790.7200000000003s)]
*  You love your children. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3791.56s)]
*  You want your children to be successful. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3792.48s)]
*  If I want my child to be successful in the world we're going into, you [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3794.52s)]
*  know, whether it turns into a control grid or the control grid as I believe [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3798.68s)]
*  will fail, you know, you want them to have an outstanding education. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3802.0s)]
*  And I will tell you bluntly, the reason the unipolar model failed is because [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3806.7999999999997s)]
*  we don't have a culture that can field and manage unipolar. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3812.7999999999997s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3816.92s)]
*  We don't, we don't have the human capital to run the world. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3818.24s)]
*  We don't have the human capital, but we're teaching our human capital to adopt [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3821.88s)]
*  a culture that, that cannot succeed. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3826.2400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3828.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3829.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3829.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3829.56s)]
*  So if you're going to run the world, you need Eaton and Sandhurst to, to, to [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3829.72s)]
*  provide an administrative class that's tough, clear thinking, has a well-defined [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3833.64s)]
*  mission, sacrificing. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3838.4s)]
*  You need Christianity. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3840.76s)]
*  Well, both of those, you know, certainly Eaton was a Christian school. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3842.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3846.0s)]
*  You, you, if you, if you're going to be part of a project that is longer than a [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3846.7599999999998s)]
*  lifetime, then you have to understand that this is about, you know, at the root, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3852.52s)]
*  this is about your immortal soul and your soul is immortal. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3858.9199999999996s)]
*  And that, that triggers a very different way of looking at the world and a very [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3862.3599999999997s)]
*  different way of thinking, and then you have to be able to collaborate across [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3867.08s)]
*  time and space in very powerful ways. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3871.4399999999996s)]
*  That takes trust and faith. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3873.8799999999997s)]
*  You have to be agreement capable and you can't run a, a unipolar model, let [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3875.44s)]
*  alone a successful multipolar model, unless you're agreement capable. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3881.36s)]
*  So this is Lavrov's term and this is what the Russians understood. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3885.2400000000002s)]
*  And this is why they whooped our ass in Ukraine. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3888.84s)]
*  They are agreement capable and we are not. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3891.28s)]

*  model in the mid nineties when the budget deal failed. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3987.64s)]
*  I think you said 90 was 95. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3990.08s)]
*  I vaguely remember that. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3991.6s)]
*  Um, you know, this, this democratic system or whatever version of a democratic [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3993.12s)]
*  system we have, our system is incapable of self perpetuating longterm. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=3998.68s)]
*  It's just too dysfunctional. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4003.92s)]
*  And that's obviously true. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4004.96s)]
*  It's too corrupt. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4006.0s)]
*  It's too corrupt. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4006.84s)]
*  It's too corrupt. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4007.56s)]
*  It's clearly true. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4008.08s)]
*  Everyone senses that, um, this isn't working. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4009.12s)]
*  We're going to get a new system. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4012.0s)]
*  They figured that out 30 years ago. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4013.48s)]
*  The one kind of brick wall that is looming right in the windshield is the debt, is [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4015.8s)]
*  the debt meltdown? [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4020.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, Ray Dalio talks about it every single day. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4021.4s)]
*  Like we have too much debt. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4023.28s)]
*  People are going to stop buying our debt because it's clearly a bad deal. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4025.2400000000002s)]
*  And like, what happens then? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4029.76s)]
*  And you suggested the control grid is in part designed to manage the population [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4030.96s)]
*  during that moment, maybe. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4035.92s)]
*  Yeah, in part. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4037.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4038.96s)]
*  So, so if you want to move people to a much lower economic footprint, let [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4039.7200000000003s)]
*  alone do it on a shocking basis, having complete control is obviously very [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4045.2s)]
*  convenient. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4049.6s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4049.8799999999997s)]
*  So the bottom line is everybody's about to get a lot poorer, not everybody, but [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4049.9199999999996s)]
*  a lot of the majority is about to get a lot poorer. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4053.3199999999997s)]
*  Depends on how they do that. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4056.48s)]
*  If you bring out breakthrough energy, you can soften the blow. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4057.7599999999998s)]
*  There are many things you can do to soften the blow. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4060.9199999999996s)]
*  It doesn't have to be like Russia in 90 and 91. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4063.64s)]
*  That's exactly what I was thinking. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4066.48s)]
*  It doesn't have to be, can they do it that way? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4067.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4069.7599999999998s)]
*  So it comes down to who governs and, and do they want to do it? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4071.0s)]
*  You know, one of my favorite lines is from Tina Turner. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4075.76s)]
*  She says, we can do this nice or rough. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4077.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4080.6800000000003s)]
*  And we could do it nice and we can do it rough. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4081.4s)]
*  There are ways of doing the control grid nice and we can do it rough. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4084.1200000000003s)]
*  And what are they planning? [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4088.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4089.36s)]
*  To a certain extent, remember the way, in my experience, the way they govern is [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4090.36s)]
*  they have targets and goals and then, you know, you sort of make it up as you go. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4095.2799999999997s)]
*  And sometimes it works and say, it's very fluid. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4100.24s)]
*  So I wonder if the AI, if the data center boom, which really is the only sort of [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4102.16s)]
*  crackling, sparkling piece of the real estate market right now, I think it's [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4107.0s)]
*  building data centers, development market. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4110.719999999999s)]
*  Just call them control grids. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4113.5599999999995s)]
*  Control grids, control. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4115.12s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm totally opposed to it, but massive bets, economic bets on the [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4116.08s)]
*  success of AI, right? [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4122.92s)]
*  And the missing piece is energy and how do you power all that? [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4124.4800000000005s)]
*  And we're already, as you pointed out in analysis, I read that. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4128.04s)]
*  You have to, you have to bring out the breakthrough. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4130.6s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4132.36s)]
*  So like either they're going to build it on coal deposits in Wyoming, or which is [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4133.6s)]
*  going to be kind of hard because they're going to have to say all that climate [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4138.88s)]
*  stuff we've been yelling at you about for 30 years is total bullshit. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4142.2s)]
*  Now we're burning coal. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4144.88s)]
*  I don't know if they can. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4146.16s)]
*  There was just an article in Bloomberg, the Texas needs 30 new nuclear plants and [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4146.88s)]
*  the Chinese are building enormous numbers of nuclear plants. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4151.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4154.5599999999995s)]
*  And there are risks in nuclear. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4154.84s)]
*  I mean, I'm a right winger and I've always defended nuclear, but let's be totally [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4155.92s)]
*  honest, like it's not risk free, big time. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4159.12s)]
*  Well, here's the thing. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4161.12s)]
*  How do you, how do you govern and manage nuclear plants with leadership that's [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4161.8s)]
*  not agreement capable? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4166.4s)]
*  Completely. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4168.16s)]
*  And also like in a country that's not turning out enough people in the [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4168.84s)]
*  heart, not enough engineers. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4173.24s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4175.32s)]
*  So no, there are huge problems with that. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4175.599999999999s)]
*  And, um, but that's like, that question is being forced on policy makers. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4177.92s)]
*  Like, what do you do about energy? [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4182.72s)]
*  What do you do about energy? [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4183.84s)]
*  What have you been in wind and solar? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4184.64s)]
*  Like, we're going to be laughing about that in five years. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4186.32s)]
*  Cause it's just silly. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4188.28s)]
*  Well, one of the things you can do about energy is depopulate. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4189.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4194.12s)]
*  And I know for a fact, I'm not guessing at this, that there are people running [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4196.12s)]
*  countries around the world who've thought about like, what does AI mean for my [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4199.72s)]
*  population means I've got too many people. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4202.96s)]
*  So this is something I know this for a fact, I'm not guessing that leaders of [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4205.24s)]
*  countries are talking about between each other. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4209.599999999999s)]
*  Like I know that. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4212.44s)]
*  And I'm not saying they're committing genocide or whatever, but they know that [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4213.599999999999s)]
*  they're about to be far fewer people. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4217.96s)]
*  They are. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4219.92s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4220.36s)]
*  So there's another thing that I don't understand very well. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4221.599999999999s)]
*  I've just listened to people, but if you listen to Sean Parker saying, I'm going [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4225.8s)]
*  live to 145, where there's an interview where the president's son-in-law says, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4229.56s)]
*  you know, we're going to be the last generation to die or the first [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4235.64s)]
*  generation to live forever. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4239.56s)]
*  So you clearly have a group of people biohacking who think they can [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4241.68s)]
*  engage in massive longevity. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4246.84s)]
*  It makes me want to start smoking again. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4248.8s)]
*  I'm just being honest. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4250.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't want to be, I just want to move. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4251.400000000001s)]
*  I want to pivot away from that level of soul destroying hubris. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4253.4800000000005s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4257.0s)]
*  Cause that's what that is. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4257.200000000001s)]
*  I'm God. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4258.0s)]
*  No, you're not. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4259.0s)]
*  And you're going to find out the hard way that you're not. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4259.52s)]
*  So it does make me want to smoke. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4261.360000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4263.120000000001s)]
*  But what I'm saying is if you, if you truly believe you can do that and you're [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4263.400000000001s)]
*  not going to allow the general population to do it for environmental reasons, then [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4268.120000000001s)]
*  you would be for depopulation. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4272.120000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4273.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4274.320000000001s)]
*  Well, that's totally true. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4274.52s)]
*  So this is again, Farfield, do you think there's evidence that [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4275.76s)]
*  people will be living to 145? [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4278.200000000001s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4280.52s)]
*  I don't either. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4281.320000000001s)]
*  I don't really care. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4281.88s)]
*  In other words, there's a whole set of scenarios I don't care about. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4282.92s)]
*  I'm interested in freedom. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4287.04s)]
*  And I believe that the only way we can be free is through a culture that embraces [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4289.8s)]
*  the divine and builds true wealth, enduring wealth and living wealth, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4296.56s)]
*  not just financial wealth. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4302.200000000001s)]
*  What is true wealth? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4304.160000000001s)]
*  True wealth. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4305.6s)]
*  Well, you know, cause I would say you're truly, truly wealthy. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4307.56s)]
*  I feel I am. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4311.280000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4312.240000000001s)]
*  I don't have that much money, but I feel that way. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4313.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it's an integration of living equity with financial equity. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4315.16s)]
*  And what I learned being a financial advisor is that everyone had been taught [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4320.0s)]
*  to build financial equity and they couldn't integrate it with living equity. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4325.36s)]
*  So you'd, you'd work with somebody who's, you know, worth millions of dollars who [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4329.0s)]
*  said they couldn't afford organic food. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4333.24s)]
*  I was like, are you crazy? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4334.76s)]
*  You know, the number one thing that causes a diminution of family wealth is [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4336.48s)]
*  health problems and, and, you know, healthcare fraud and healthcare [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4341.5599999999995s)]
*  bankruptcies, like, you know, please take a million dollars out of your bank account [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4346.76s)]
*  and start investing in really building, you know, doing everything you and your [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4351.92s)]
*  family need to be really healthy, you know, to have perfect water, to have great [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  food, et cetera. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4361.679999999999s)]
*  The other thing I discovered was, you know, everybody was trained to put their [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4362.96s)]
*  money in the national security state instead of helping their kids buy homes. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4366.44s)]
*  And, and integrating with, you know, building the living equity. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4370.68s)]
*  So my mother's family were Quakers and you didn't even think about buying [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4375.320000000001s)]
*  stock until you sent all your kids to the best Quaker schools. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4379.84s)]
*  You know, that was like, that was first. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4383.12s)]
*  That's what you think. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4385.360000000001s)]
*  It's a, you're dropping so much here. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4386.320000000001s)]
*  I'm just trying to pause, like tease out certain themes, but you think it's wiser. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4388.16s)]
*  Um, you know, if you have children and you care about them to help them [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4393.320000000001s)]
*  buy homes than it is to. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4395.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4397.04s)]
*  Who, who's so can I, there are two stories I'm dying to tell you. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4399.08s)]
*  Please. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4403.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4403.76s)]
*  During the litigation, um, you know, you get in the situation where, so I [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4404.88s)]
*  litigated with the department of justice for 11 years, or actually it was, it was [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4409.88s)]
*  some of that was fisticuffing with the tax guys, but anyway, so, so I had the [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4416.4s)]
*  sort of, uh, enemy of the state process of, I had 18 audits and investigations. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4421.4s)]
*  Um, 12 tracks of litigation, a smear campaign and physical harassment. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4428.08s)]
*  So they didn't like what you were saying? [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4432.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, they didn't like the idea that I would try and stop the mortgage bubble. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4434.28s)]
*  They really wanted to have a mortgage bubble and, and we were doing things [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4437.32s)]
*  to bring disclosure to, um, to play it's called place-based financials. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4441.72s)]
*  I really believed that if local communities could see how all the money [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4447.16s)]
*  worked in their neighborhood, that we could change things. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4453.0s)]
*  So for example, I would constantly, when I was at the department of [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4456.5199999999995s)]
*  housing and urban development, I would find neighborhoods where we were [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4460.04s)]
*  spending 250,000 per unit to build public housing and $50,000 would buy and [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4464.5199999999995s)]
*  rehab a defaulted, a foreclosed property in the FHA, uh, inventory. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4470.5199999999995s)]
*  And so literally, if you could just within a four or 10 block area, you [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4477.639999999999s)]
*  know, take that 250,000 and, and, and spend it in the way that was the most [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4482.44s)]
*  efficient in that place, you could get four or five homes for the price of one. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4487.32s)]
*  And it was really amazing when I took those numbers, we did all sorts of [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4491.839999999999s)]
*  due diligence, this is when I was a contractor, um, to the woman who worked [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4495.799999999999s)]
*  for the guy who ran the $250,000 program. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4501.08s)]
*  And I showed it to her and I said, look, we could, you know, New [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4504.679999999999s)]
*  Orleans, Chicago, LA, we could get four or five homes for the price of one. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4507.599999999999s)]
*  And she turned bright red and she said, but how would we generate fees for our [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4512.44s)]
*  friends? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4516.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4516.799999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4517.5199999999995s)]
*  Or how would we, you know, pay off foreign countries who flood our, our [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4518.36s)]
*  political system with donations if, you know, if we're actually spending it to [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4522.5599999999995s)]
*  like build nice houses for Americans, like repair Reading, Pennsylvania, we [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4525.639999999999s)]
*  could be spending it in more of a disgusting Middle Eastern place. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4529.96s)]
*  So, so if you look at place-based financial statements, there's [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4533.24s)]
*  extraordinary opportunity to just re-engineer what's already there. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4536.36s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4540.12s)]
*  Without taking money from anybody else and, and making it. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4540.84s)]
*  So I really thought if you, if you create, so we created a software tool called [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4544.280000000001s)]
*  community wizard that would allow everybody on the internet to just come [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4547.96s)]
*  and download the data and start looking at how the money worked in their places [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4551.68s)]
*  in way that you could see real opportunities. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4554.76s)]
*  Okay. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4557.280000000001s)]
*  So let me tell you two stories. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4557.56s)]
*  The, the, um, the litigation starts and literally you go from being very wealthy [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4559.320000000001s)]
*  and very trusted and very respected to being an enemy of the state. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4565.96s)]
*  No one will talk to you, don't you know, it's your phone and suddenly all [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4571.64s)]
*  your income stops, all your income stops, your credit stops, you're just frozen. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4575.0s)]
*  And by years, you mean yours. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4580.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4582.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4582.56s)]
*  So, so, uh, anyway, so, you know, you, you have the assets that you have. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4582.96s)]
*  Luckily they never turned off my bank account, so I was lucky that way. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4588.16s)]
*  But one of the things that happened was they started, I had had a farm in New [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4591.72s)]
*  Hampshire and I sold my share to my uncle and a wonderful and very wealthy uncle [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4597.56s)]
*  who was like the patriarch and, and he bought my, and I warned him, if you buy [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4602.4400000000005s)]
*  this, you know, they may come after you too. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4608.320000000001s)]
*  And he was a very standup guy, very fearless. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4611.56s)]
*  And he said, you know, I'll deal with that. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4613.96s)]
*  So sure enough, um, I sell him the farmland, they call him and they say, [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4615.320000000001s)]
*  you know, your niece is a criminal and you shouldn't be doing this. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4620.28s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4622.8s)]
*  And, um, and they said, we want the financial records from the farm. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4624.16s)]
*  We want all the financial records of the farm. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4630.639999999999s)]
*  And he said, well, send me a letter so I can give it to my lawyer and I'm [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4633.44s)]
*  happy to send them to you. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4636.4s)]
*  So they, you know, and this is the summer farm where all the family goes. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4638.12s)]
*  Anyway, so, so instead of sending him a letter, they show up at his house in [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4642.24s)]
*  Portsmouth, New Hampshire at 9 PM at night, three FBI guys and a HUD IG guy [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4648.0s)]
*  with a subpoena and it was designed to scare him. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4654.8s)]
*  So the family had a big powwow. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4658.08s)]
*  Should they drop me because they don't want to be targeted. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4661.4s)]
*  And, um, and he said, well, you know, uh, she always helped us. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4665.04s)]
*  So it turned out, I counted it up at that point. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4671.6s)]
*  I had lent or given to family and friends, $250,000. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4675.6s)]
*  Just, I made a lot of money. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4680.92s)]
*  I loved making money and people needed help. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4683.200000000001s)]
*  And that's what's money's for. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4686.0s)]
*  So that is what to restate. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4687.160000000001s)]
*  That is what money is for. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4689.04s)]
*  So I just always said, I hadn't even thought about it. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4690.400000000001s)]
*  By the way, your average, like 23 year old NBA player who's floating all of [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4692.92s)]
*  his cousins and single mom, he understands that better than your average rich person. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4697.120000000001s)]
*  Your obligation is to your family and including with money. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4701.72s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4704.92s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4705.8s)]
*  Some of us are lucky. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4706.0s)]
*  Some not. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4706.96s)]
*  Amen. [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4707.400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4708.120000000001s)]
*  So, so he said, she helped everyone. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4708.92s)]
*  So I'm going to help her. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4713.120000000001s)]
*  And it took 11 years, but at the very, no, it was 2006. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4715.72s)]
*  So that was about nine years at the end of the process. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4720.160000000001s)]
*  When I won the litigation, I got, we got money coming in. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4725.56s)]
*  I sat down to either repay everybody who loaned me or gifted me money. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4730.6s)]
*  And, or almost everybody, some had just gifted. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4735.36s)]
*  And I, I counted it up. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4738.64s)]
*  And what I realized is I had come into the litigation, having loaned a quarter [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4740.92s)]
*  of a million, and then over the next nine years, exactly a quarter of a million had [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4745.76s)]
*  come back and it wasn't tit for tat. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4751.8s)]
*  I mean, it was different people, different thing. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4754.92s)]
*  You know, some had gotten said, well, I guess she needs it back and repaid it. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4757.16s)]
*  Or some had just gifted it because they knew I'd gifted. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4760.68s)]
*  And literally I put a quarter of a million out and a quarter of a million came back. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4763.959999999999s)]
*  And Tucker, if it wasn't for that money, I wouldn't be here. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4768.48s)]
*  I would never have made it through. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4770.839999999999s)]
*  And it was because it was in the people bank and they couldn't [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4773.639999999999s)]
*  shut the people back off. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4776.48s)]
*  You know, they could, they could do all sorts of things to shut off all, all [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4778.679999999999s)]
*  sorts of resources and income. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4782.24s)]
*  But if it's in the people back and the people you love and trust, you know, it [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4784.16s)]
*  comes back so when I love that, yeah, it's great. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4788.48s)]
*  So when I finished, when I finished the litigation, I had had a 401k that I'd had [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4792.599999999999s)]
*  to bust and had 500,000 in it. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4797.96s)]
*  I paid 225,000 in fines and taxes to get it out. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4801.12s)]
*  Well, I don't think they thought they put my 401k under audit so I couldn't use it [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4805.759999999999s)]
*  to finance the business. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4810.799999999999s)]
*  It was dirty tricks. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4812.32s)]
*  Anyway, so, so I take the money out. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4813.799999999999s)]
*  So my accountant, when we get the settlement money, she said, let's [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4816.719999999999s)]
*  fund up the 401k. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4820.5199999999995s)]
*  I said, no, I'm never going into business with the U S government again. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4822.719999999999s)]
*  No way. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4825.879999999999s)]
*  I don't, I don't want any of those vehicles. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4826.44s)]
*  I'm out. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4828.679999999999s)]
*  And I said, but the other thing is I'm taking that 500,000 and I'm [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4829.92s)]
*  bonusing it out on the people bank. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4833.799999999999s)]
*  And I'm going to start a new business and I think that business will be successful. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4836.799999999999s)]
*  So I don't need that 500,000. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4840.719999999999s)]
*  It'd be nice, but I don't need it. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4842.44s)]
*  But I need to get that money back in the people bank because that is the only bank [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4844.28s)]
*  in this world I trust. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4847.799999999999s)]
*  And so, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4849.44s)]
*  Oh, that's like a beautiful story. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4850.52s)]
*  Well, here's the question. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4853.16s)]
*  And I used to always say this with my clients, who's going to be there for you. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4855.84s)]
*  Right. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4861.44s)]
*  Who's going to be there for you that that's the people bank and you want to [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4861.88s)]
*  invest in the people bank. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4866.16s)]
*  Now it may not be money. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4867.28s)]
*  It may be time. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4868.32s)]
*  It may be help. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4869.56s)]
*  It may be, there's a, a wonderful book called family wealth by a guy named James [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4870.52s)]
*  Hughes. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4875.28s)]
*  I don't know if you've ever heard of it or seen it. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4875.68s)]
*  And basically what he does, my great uncle didn't like the book so much. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4878.04s)]
*  He said, you're trying to turn our family into a corporation. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4882.4800000000005s)]
*  I said, no, I'm not. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4884.72s)]
*  But it basically teaches a family how to conspire together. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4886.0s)]
*  It basically have a dinner once a month or once a whatever, and talk about what's [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4889.04s)]
*  in your heart to do. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4895.120000000001s)]
*  You know, this person wants to do this. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4896.120000000001s)]
*  This person wants to do this. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4898.400000000001s)]
*  Some things make money. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4899.84s)]
*  Some things don't, but, but, but help each other be successful at whatever your [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4900.8s)]
*  passion is and, and work as a family. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4906.24s)]
*  You know, I always, it's hilarious. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4909.8s)]
*  We say, don't worry about if there is a conspiracy, if you're not in one, you [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4911.04s)]
*  need to start one and a great family should be a, a conspiracy where you're [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4914.32s)]
*  trying to help each other succeed. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4919.2s)]
*  I love that. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4921.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4922.679999999999s)]
*  I mean, these are ancient and with respect, very obvious points, but I, I [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4923.48s)]
*  don't think I've heard someone say I'm in a long time. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4930.16s)]
*  Well, but if we're going to build a successful culture, that culture has to [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4933.0s)]
*  be good at building wealth, living wealth and financial wealth, both on an [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4938.04s)]
*  integrated basis. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4943.4800000000005s)]
*  So if you come to Saleri, we have a curriculum called building wealth and it [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4944.92s)]
*  has six pillars and we organize all of our content into and around building [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4948.88s)]
*  wealth and, um, because it's, it's part of what you have to build, to build a [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4954.36s)]
*  culture that can really be part of real solutions. [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4960.12s)]
*  So the first pillar is free and inspired life. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4963.24s)]
*  And so, you know, our theory is you have a goal, you have a relationship with the [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4966.44s)]
*  creator and you decide, you know, what's, what's your free and inspired life. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4971.5599999999995s)]
*  Everybody's unique. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4976.04s)]
*  Um, and in a decentralized world, everybody is unique. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4978.64s)]
*  You know, there's no, there's no formula, so to speak. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4981.64s)]
*  The second one is navigation tools and that's where people get burnt. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4987.160000000001s)]
*  So we say in navigation tools, there's an official reality and then there's [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4991.160000000001s)]
*  reality and you need to know both. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4995.160000000001s)]
*  And reality is for the management of your time and money and the official [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=4997.92s)]
*  reality is for the cocktail party. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5001.0s)]
*  And you need to not get those. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5003.04s)]
*  Don't use the official reality to manage your time and money. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5004.76s)]
*  Cause then you're going to get, I mean, I clean so many people up from financial [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5007.400000000001s)]
*  fraud and healthcare fraud because they believe the official reality. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5011.92s)]
*  So you can't do that. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5015.92s)]
*  The third is risk management because in this kind of dangerous environment, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5017.5199999999995s)]
*  everything's about keeping your risk down. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5021.5599999999995s)]
*  And that's more important than making money. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5025.24s)]
*  It's more important to lower risk than make money. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5027.36s)]
*  So in a, in a, in a well-governed world, we'd all be focused on outside growth. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5030.5599999999995s)]
*  But now we're just, we got to be focused on preventing loss. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5036.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5040.12s)]
*  And then the fourth is living equity and that's all living things. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5041.08s)]
*  That's people, that's family, that's culture, that's education, you know, [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5045.32s)]
*  all the things that go into that. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5050.4s)]
*  And then financial equity, all the things, you know, and then the last one is to [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5052.28s)]
*  me, the most important it's called turtle forth. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5057.36s)]
*  So did you get the hat, the turtle forth? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5059.84s)]
*  I did. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5062.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5062.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5063.56s)]
*  Turtle forth is about never quitting. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5063.84s)]
*  You must never ever quit. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5066.5199999999995s)]
*  And the whole goal of the people who are trying to centralize is to [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5069.6s)]
*  get you to think it's hopeless. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5075.6s)]
*  And John Rappaport used to always say hopelessness is an op and it's planet wide. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5077.88s)]
*  Well, cause I am, I am actually struck by, well, by everything that you've said. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5085.96s)]
*  Um, I think this could be like a nine hour conversation if we let it, but. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5091.4800000000005s)]
*  I have one more story. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5095.16s)]
*  But I am struck also by your tone. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5096.76s)]
*  I don't think I've ever heard someone describe dark deeds with more [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5099.64s)]
*  cheerfulness, like how do you, how do you not go crazy? [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5104.28s)]
*  So you have to keep a state of amusement. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5106.92s)]
*  I mean, it's, I really, you know, I, one of the most breakthrough [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5109.24s)]
*  moments for me in the last 20 years was when I, I realized that it was okay [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5114.64s)]
*  to be happy no matter what was going on. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5120.92s)]
*  And sometimes you can't be, it's so horrible what's going on, but I'll [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5123.8s)]
*  tell you exactly what had happened. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5127.28s)]
*  I had a wonderful church where I studied spiritual warfare for two and a half [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5128.56s)]
*  years at the beginning of the litigation. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5132.96s)]
*  And it was that training that saved my life. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5134.6s)]
*  And, uh, but I was at a sermon and there was a co-pastor had very long fingernails [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5137.92s)]
*  and she was very angry and she was shaking her hands with her long fingernails. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5143.64s)]
*  And you know, sometimes when you're in a big church and they point right at you [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5149.32s)]
*  and she said, she said, she said, the devil can have my house and the devil [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5152.68s)]
*  can have my car, but the devil cannot have my joy. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5157.52s)]
*  And it was like, I exploded in my head and I said, that's it. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5161.68s)]
*  That is it. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5167.0s)]
*  That is it. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5167.68s)]
*  Hey, it's Tucker Carlson. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5169.04s)]
*  You may have noticed that the companies whose products you buy tend to kind of [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5170.0s)]
*  hate you, they're controlled by massive multinational corporations and they have [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5172.84s)]
*  all kinds of weird agendas that you're supporting when you buy their products. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5177.72s)]
*  We didn't realize that nicotine pouches, which we've used for years, were in this [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5180.92s)]
*  category. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5185.4800000000005s)]
*  We just want a nicotine pouch and then they'd lecture you and take the money you [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5186.04s)]
*  give them to support things that you hate. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5189.4800000000005s)]
*  So we decide we're going to make our own and we did. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5191.68s)]
*  And it is, we can say, not bragging here, just stating fact, the single best [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5194.12s)]
*  nicotine pouch in the world is called Alvin. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5198.88s)]
*  And it comes in all kinds of excellent flavors, winter green, tropical fruit, [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5201.4800000000005s)]
*  chilled mint, refreshing, chill, sweet nectar, and a bunch of others that were [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5206.56s)]
*  rolling out. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5210.48s)]
*  By the way, there are 20 per tin, not 15 like some of our competitors will not be [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5211.0s)]
*  named Alvin. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5215.5199999999995s)]
*  And they're in three, six, and nine milligrams. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5216.599999999999s)]
*  It is the single best nicotine pouch ever made. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5219.36s)]
*  You will not regret it. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5222.2s)]
*  So it's a conscious decision not allow that to allow that joy to be stolen from [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5225.2s)]
*  you. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5228.679999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5228.959999999999s)]
*  And it's sometimes it's hard. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5229.32s)]
*  Did you ever, did you ever see the never ending story, the movie, the never [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5230.919999999999s)]
*  ending story, read the book? [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5234.48s)]
*  So, so it's a wonderful child's story where the child is the protagonist and he's [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5236.200000000001s)]
*  fighting a force in the universe called the nothing. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5243.4800000000005s)]
*  And the nothing is running around the universe, sucking meaning out of [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5247.240000000001s)]
*  everything. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5250.280000000001s)]

*  And if you look at this digital control, it comes with an energy that's very [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5253.280000000001s)]
*  demonic and, and sucking meaning out of everything. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5258.08s)]
*  And they're very good. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5261.52s)]
*  They're masterful at turning, you know, turning allies against each other. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5262.72s)]
*  The divide and conquer thing is really heartbreaking. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5266.2s)]
*  It's happening right now. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5268.360000000001s)]
*  I'm right. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5269.2s)]
*  I see it. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5269.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5270.280000000001s)]
*  And so you're up against the nothing. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5270.84s)]
*  And so sometimes we'll come together in a team meeting and somebody will say, I've [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5273.8s)]
*  lost my state of amusement. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5279.92s)]
*  And then the team's job is to help them to get it back. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5283.240000000001s)]

*  I can't, you know, [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5290.88s)]

*  If you understand, if you understand love, you can't fathom why anyone would, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5321.0s)]
*  would reject that and embrace evil because it's so stupid. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5333.44s)]
*  It's so wasteful. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5340.16s)]
*  It's so, as my mother used to say, it's so unnecessary, you know, it's just like, [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5341.56s)]
*  it's, you just can't fathom why anybody would do it. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5349.200000000001s)]
*  I, you know, I, I, I watch the folks who are in the financial system, who are [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5354.320000000001s)]

*  What they're doing is not fun. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5371.64s)]
*  I love, you know, it's not fun. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5373.04s)]
*  When, when, so I will tell you, I would, my gift, everybody has a gift. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5376.5199999999995s)]
*  My gift was an investment bank. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5381.0s)]
*  I was absolutely fantastic. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5382.5199999999995s)]
*  I was just really, really good at it. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5384.48s)]
*  And the heartbreak for me was when I got, had to leave the establishment, I lost the [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5386.8s)]
*  ability, you know, it's like a painter and you lose your ability to paint. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5391.24s)]
*  You can't get access to colors anymore. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5395.08s)]
*  So, but I loved it. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5397.5199999999995s)]
*  And when you do it in the right way, two plus two equals 20. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5399.4s)]
*  And it's so exciting. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5404.76s)]
*  It's the best feeling in the world. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5406.16s)]
*  It's like, uh, I've lived it. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5407.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5409.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5410.04s)]
*  So when Vanco, it's my theory, when Vanco finished a painting that it's [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5410.24s)]
*  what he's like, wow, you know, it's great. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5414.76s)]
*  And, and you watch these guys do the fraud and destroy, you know, all the [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5418.6s)]
*  mortgage fraud and it destroys neighborhoods and it destroys family. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5424.32s)]
*  And it's just, it's just, it's like a lose, lose, lose. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5427.4800000000005s)]
*  And you think that's no fun. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5430.68s)]
*  No, and, and they're not happy. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5433.16s)]
*  I know a number of them. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5435.4400000000005s)]
*  And, um, I had a conversation with Ray Dalio who I do like, I don't agree with [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5437.12s)]
*  them and everything, but I do like Ray Dalio and he's got more perspective on life. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5442.0s)]
*  He had lost a child. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5445.6s)]
*  I think he was forced to kind of think through what matters. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5446.68s)]
*  And I asked him off camera recently, like, do you know, I know a lot of [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5450.0s)]
*  miserable billionaires, I know a couple of happy billionaires, but how [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5453.320000000001s)]
*  many happy billionaires do you know? [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5455.8s)]
*  And he's like, I know a few, like I'm, I'm actually pretty happy, but not that [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5458.08s)]
*  many. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5461.5199999999995s)]
*  And that's a tell. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5461.879999999999s)]
*  Right. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5462.879999999999s)]
*  That's a tell. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5463.32s)]
*  And I will tell you the debt is a symptom. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5464.04s)]
*  It's not the problem. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5467.719999999999s)]
*  What's the symptom? [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5468.799999999999s)]
*  The debt. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5469.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5470.28s)]
*  The debt. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5470.48s)]
*  The debt is a simple. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5471.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5472.5599999999995s)]
*  When there was 21 trillion missing as of 2015, when we published that study in [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5475.08s)]
*  2017, there was 21 trillion of debt. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5482.28s)]
*  Now, first of all, remember the treasury can just issue currency. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5484.799999999999s)]
*  They don't need debt. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5488.28s)]
*  To create the currency. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5489.4s)]
*  And in fact, I would say historically the greatest currencies are fiat [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5490.96s)]
*  currencies that are not debt-based. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5494.32s)]
*  So our problem is the debt basing, but, but let's just grossly oversimplify and [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5496.639999999999s)]
*  talk about what that means with the 21 trillion. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5502.719999999999s)]
*  So the treasury sells pension, sells treasury bonds to our pension funds, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5505.719999999999s)]
*  moves 21 trillion into the bank accounts at the New York Fed member banks for the [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5510.2s)]
*  treasury, they're the depository. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5516.4s)]
*  And then the 21 trillion disappears out of the back door. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5518.679999999999s)]
*  So it's just a straw that's sucking our pension fund money into, I call it [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5523.08s)]
*  the breakaway civilization. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5530.76s)]
*  And meantime, we as taxpayers are now obligated to pay the debt into that [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5533.16s)]
*  we owe our pension funds and the money is gone. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5538.719999999999s)]
*  Why do you call it the breakaway civilization? [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5541.5199999999995s)]
*  Breakaway civilization was a term made famous by Richard Dolan. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5543.5199999999995s)]
*  And it simply described a decision to create a parallel system. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5547.32s)]
*  You know, first it started with the black budget, but it grew, you know, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5554.679999999999s)]
*  call it the national security state. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5558.12s)]
*  But, but to build a civilization that literally was separate and not [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5560.5599999999995s)]
*  subject to the laws of the existing ones. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5565.44s)]
*  So if I'm running a company and I want to bring up my own business, I'm [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5567.12s)]
*  if I'm running a company and I want to bring up new systems, I'll bring up the [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5571.5199999999995s)]
*  new systems while I'm running the old and I'll run them in parallel and I'll [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5575.8s)]
*  move things over slowly. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5579.2s)]
*  And then at some point I bring the current thing down. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5580.679999999999s)]
*  And to me, that's what the financial coup was. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5583.84s)]
*  You're moving the money out of one system and putting it in another. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5585.679999999999s)]
*  So in theory, 21 trillion is enough at a 5%, you know, interest rate to basically [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5590.28s)]
*  finance a private government, if you will. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5597.88s)]
*  Right. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5601.68s)]
*  I'm not saying that's what happened, but in theory, do you think it did? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5602.28s)]
*  So when I was at HUD in 1989, it was late 89 or early 90, I was in a meeting with [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5607.76s)]
*  the secretary and we had brought all the regional administrators in for a meeting [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5616.16s)]
*  with the secretary and he was very upset because the regional administrator [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5622.08s)]
*  from California had implemented something in response to a court decision. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5627.76s)]
*  There was a court case in the court of appeals and they decided, okay, you [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5632.84s)]
*  got to go to the right. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5637.320000000001s)]
*  And so he had implemented that. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5638.24s)]
*  And the secretary was having literally like a manic episode, screaming a huge [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5640.84s)]
*  temper tantrum, screaming at him. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5647.320000000001s)]
*  And finally this guy said, but Mr. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5649.16s)]
*  Secretary, it's the law. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5651.24s)]
*  And he just exploded with fury and he said, the law, the law, I don't have to [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5654.84s)]
*  obey the law, I report to a higher moral authority. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5661.16s)]
*  And just at that moment, it was like, remember the scene in Eyes Wide Shut [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5665.88s)]
*  when you first walk in on the, you know, the secret society doing their occult [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5669.84s)]
*  ritual, you know, you had this image of, oh, you know, he literally, he doesn't [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5675.08s)]
*  have to obey the laws of the United States. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5682.12s)]
*  He's operating under a different governance structure. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5684.24s)]
*  People feel that way. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5687.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5688.48s)]
*  And that, you know, there, there are many, there's a very famous story of [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5688.92s)]
*  Lincoln when he's talking about his, what he wants to do to implement the [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5695.84s)]
*  reconstruction policies and he tells a story about a young child saying, you [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5701.48s)]
*  know, if I throw the fish back, dad'll get mad at me, but if I, if I, if it [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5708.5199999999995s)]
*  slips from my hand accidentally and you grab it, then dad won't be mad at me. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5716.839999999999s)]
*  And the implication of the story is that Lincoln has a dad that he, he can't buck. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5722.04s)]
*  And, and, you know, we're back to the question, who's dad? [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5729.04s)]
*  It's the same question as who's Mr. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5731.839999999999s)]
*  Global. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5733.36s)]
*  And you've never gotten closer to the answer or you've never settled on an [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5734.04s)]
*  answer. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5737.799999999999s)]
*  I, here's my guess. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5739.0s)]
*  So we did, I once did a two hour interview on the Salary Report on Who [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5742.08s)]
*  is Mr. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5745.679999999999s)]
*  Global, where we go through all the different theories. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5746.08s)]
*  So I think literally you have intergenerational pools of capital, which [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5749.32s)]
*  meet and work by consensus, you know, it's a committee system and they do have a set [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5754.799999999999s)]
*  of rules and what I don't understand, I think their challenge is their risk [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5759.48s)]
*  managers and they're, they're constantly pulling out a lot of money and they [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5765.76s)]
*  always need to get that dividend. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5770.52s)]
*  And the question is, why do they need the dividend? [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5772.400000000001s)]
*  Where's the money going? [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5774.4800000000005s)]
*  Cause they're constantly running the financial system to extract extra money. [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5775.92s)]
*  There's always disappearing money. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5781.76s)]
*  And the question is why and where's it's going. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5783.360000000001s)]
*  And you think it's going to infrastructure projects? [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5786.360000000001s)]
*  I think it's going to infrastructure projects. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5789.4400000000005s)]
*  I think it's going to big investments in infrastructure projects. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5791.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's going to big investments like, you know, building the control [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5794.88s)]
*  grid is a big one. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5798.84s)]
*  And one of my questions on the financial coup is are they literally setting up an [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5800.56s)]
*  endowment so they can run, you know, the world on a global governance that's a [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5805.16s)]
*  dictatorship with an endowment. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5810.8s)]
*  So it's the, you know, it's, it's a bigger endowment than anybody else's. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5813.2s)]
*  You said a couple of minutes ago that the debt, the US government's debt, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5819.04s)]
*  even people are not interested in this stuff are aware that it's, it's, it's [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5825.0s)]
*  there and that it's a problem is not the problem. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5828.6s)]
*  It's a symptom. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5831.8s)]
*  What, what did you mean? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5832.6s)]
*  We, if you look at our current model, it is not being run on an economic basis [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5834.16s)]
*  and it's getting much worse and it's getting worse steadily. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5843.4800000000005s)]
*  So let me give you an example. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5846.16s)]
*  Our military budget this year is approximately 850 billion and the [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5848.28s)]
*  president wants to take it or the secretary of defense is saying we've [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5854.36s)]
*  got to take it to a trillion. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5857.12s)]
*  Our HHS budget is 1.8 trillion. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5859.719999999999s)]
*  Dr. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5865.28s)]
*  Skidmore just did an analysis. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5865.639999999999s)]
*  If we went back to 2010 levels of disability, we would lower that by half a [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5867.4s)]
*  trillion dollars, half a trillion, half a trillion. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5872.4s)]
*  So America is, I call it the great poisoning. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5876.16s)]
*  We've poisoned ourselves and it's blowing the budget. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5880.32s)]
*  And it's not just blowing the budget of the federal government. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5883.719999999999s)]
*  If you look at family budgets, it's blowing their budgets. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5885.92s)]
*  You know, poison people are not productive and their healthcare [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5888.96s)]
*  costs can be very expensive. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5892.599999999999s)]
*  And you see that at the federal level and you see that at the state level, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5894.36s)]
*  the local level and the family level. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5897.36s)]
*  That's got to be dealt with. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5899.719999999999s)]
*  But, you know, if, if you look at the budget right now, it's expenses are [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5901.24s)]
*  skyrocketing and, and it's skyrocketing because the fundamental model of what [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5906.12s)]
*  we do and how we do it, it helps to centralize, but it's not economic. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5911.68s)]
*  And so you got to change that. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5917.160000000001s)]
*  Now, [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5919.12s)]
*  what we do and how we do it. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5919.8s)]
*  Do you mean how we live? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5921.76s)]
*  Right. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5923.200000000001s)]
*  So now I get to tell you my last story. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5923.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5926.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't wait. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5928.320000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5931.0s)]
*  This is called the red button story. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5931.320000000001s)]
*  And if you put my name in on the internet, you'll get, you know, a copy of [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5933.64s)]
*  this story because it happened to me in 2000. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5937.52s)]
*  I was asked by a healthcare practitioner to give a presentation called how the [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5941.32s)]
*  money works on organized crime. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5947.5599999999995s)]
*  And it later became a very famous article called Narco dollars for beginners. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5949.48s)]
*  And it was meant to be a light, funny description of the intersection of [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5954.84s)]
*  organized crime flows with Washington and Wall Street. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5959.599999999999s)]
*  So my book, I have an online book called Dylan Reed and the aristocracy of stock [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5963.48s)]
*  profits. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5967.36s)]
*  That is a case study that teaches people it's designed to be like a business [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5968.4s)]
*  schools case study that shows you that intersection between illegal cash flows [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5972.88s)]
*  and Wall Street in Washington. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5978.84s)]
*  Anyway, so I'm in the middle of the speech and I'm describing the congressional [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5981.44s)]
*  testimony on the dark Alliance allegations that happened in 1998. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5986.679999999999s)]
*  And at the time I was helping a reporter, um, do research and she was covering the [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5991.4400000000005s)]
*  hearings and a spokesperson for the department of justice told her, so I'm in [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=5997.84s)]
*  the middle of the speech and there are about a hundred people and the conference [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6003.4800000000005s)]
*  that where I'm speaking is, um, a conference that happens once a year by this group. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6007.64s)]
*  And the focus is on how we evolve our society spiritually. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6015.24s)]
*  So this is a very spiritually committed group of people who want to evolve our [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6018.5599999999995s)]
*  society spiritually. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6022.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6023.2s)]
*  So I'm describing the, um, the fact that a spokesperson for the department of [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6024.0s)]
*  justice told this reporter, I was helping that the U S economy launders 500 billion [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6029.28s)]
*  to a trillion dollars a year of all illegal money. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6034.2s)]
*  So that's narcotics trafficking, that's financial fraud, that's, you know, [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6037.84s)]
*  everything it's human trafficking. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6041.36s)]
*  And, um, and the number is now much, much bigger, but they were describing the fact [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6043.72s)]
*  that the U S economy and financial system is the leader globally in laundering [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6048.44s)]
*  dirty money. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6053.5599999999995s)]
*  So I said to this wonderful group of spiritually evolved people, what would [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6055.12s)]
*  happen if we stopped being the global leader in money laundering and we had a [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6060.28s)]
*  little conversation, they said, well, you know, the money would leave the New York [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6066.68s)]
*  stock exchange and go to Singapore, Zurich or London. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6070.72s)]
*  Um, and, and we'd have, we might have trouble financing the government deficit [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6074.96s)]
*  cause we, you know, now we borrow over half of the money currently. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6079.16s)]
*  Um, and, and so we, we, you know, our taxes might go up or our government [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6083.88s)]
*  checks might stop. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6088.4800000000005s)]
*  So I said, okay, let's pretend there's a big red button up here on the [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6089.96s)]
*  lectern and if you push that button, um, you can stop all hard, hard narcotics [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6092.88s)]
*  trafficking in your town, your County, your state tomorrow, thus offending the [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6099.2s)]
*  people who control 500 billion to a trillion dollars a year of all dirty [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6105.8s)]
*  money in the accumulated capital they're on who here will push the button and out [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6108.96s)]
*  of a hundred people dedicated to evolving our society spiritually, guess [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6113.599999999999s)]
*  how many would push the button? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6117.24s)]
*  One. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6119.48s)]
*  The other 99 would not push the button. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6120.679999999999s)]
*  So I said, keep all those kids from dying. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6123.32s)]
*  Yeah, it would. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6125.8s)]
*  So wait. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6127.12s)]
*  So, so I said to them, I said, why would you not push the button? [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6127.6s)]
*  So we had a little conversation. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6131.96s)]
*  They said, we don't want our taxes to go up. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6133.240000000001s)]
*  We don't want our government checks to stop and we don't want our [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6135.52s)]
*  401ks and IRAs to go down. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6138.84s)]
*  So if I had voted, there would have been two pushing the red button. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6142.84s)]
*  So when I discovered that day, the problem was that not that they [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6146.0s)]
*  wouldn't push the red button, but they wouldn't go into the invention room [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6151.64s)]
*  and have an honest conversation about what the real problem was and how I call [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6155.2s)]
*  it, how we turn the red button green, how we make money pushing the red button, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6160.68s)]
*  because then we can push the red button and you have to push the red button [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6164.44s)]
*  because you cannot become wealthy liquidating your children. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6168.96s)]
*  You cannot become wealthy by poisoning your children and your people. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6173.84s)]
*  And yet that's what we've been doing in America for decades now. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6177.96s)]
*  And now here's the political problem. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6181.96s)]
*  If you're the new president of the United States and you walk into the Oval Office, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6184.92s)]
*  your political guy is going to say to you, Mr. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6191.44s)]
*  President, the American people just spent billions getting you voted in as president. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6194.639999999999s)]
*  And now they want payback. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6199.08s)]
*  They want their government contract. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6200.28s)]
*  They want their privatization. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6201.96s)]
*  They want the coal increase on social security. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6204.36s)]
*  They want a community block development grant. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6206.639999999999s)]
*  And you're going to turn to your secretary of charging. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6209.16s)]
*  He says, well, you better be nice to the people who control 500 billion [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6210.96s)]
*  dollars and the accumulated capital there on. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6214.320000000001s)]
*  And of course, the number is much bigger now. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6217.08s)]
*  Now, how are you going to press the red button? [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6218.8s)]
*  You can't. And if you look at the history of politics in America, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6222.0s)]
*  the history is everybody wants their check and they want the story of I am good. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6226.2s)]
*  I'm a good Christian. [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6231.04s)]
*  I'm not doing any of this corrupt, organized crime stuff. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6232.72s)]
*  You know, I'm just voting. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6236.320000000001s)]
*  You know, so so I say it this way. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6239.04s)]
*  When Goldwater, the end of World War II, George Keenan said, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6241.48s)]
*  we got six percent of the people and 50 percent of the resources, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6245.719999999999s)]
*  and we're going to have to be tough if we keep this going. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6248.799999999999s)]
*  So Goldwater ran for president. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6251.44s)]
*  He said, we're going to have to drop a lot of bombs. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6253.0s)]
*  And the American people said, oh, no, we don't want to do that. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6255.48s)]
*  We're good Christians. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6257.799999999999s)]
*  So Jimmy Carter came along and he shivered in front of the fireplace. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6259.16s)]
*  And Americans said, oh, no, we don't want to do that. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6262.799999999999s)]
*  We don't want to cut back. [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6266.839999999999s)]
*  And so the Bushes came along and said, you know something? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6267.879999999999s)]
*  You all are good Christians. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6270.36s)]
*  Here's your check. Don't ask questions. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6271.6s)]
*  And that's where we've been. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6274.5599999999995s)]
*  Everybody wants the story of I am good. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6276.2s)]
*  And the problem, you can you can push the red button. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6278.04s)]
*  You can turn it green, but it has to be done one neighborhood at a time. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6282.8s)]
*  You need to take all the money in a place. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6287.24s)]
*  And instead of spending the government money to centralize control [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6289.96s)]
*  and on the control grid, you need to reengineer it to build real wealth. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6293.68s)]
*  And and you've got to decentralize the economic power. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6298.360000000001s)]
*  If you centralize and you create lots of billionaires, [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6302.16s)]
*  you're going to shrink the pie. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6305.280000000001s)]
*  And that's what we've been doing. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6306.400000000001s)]
*  And we've been making money from poisoning each other. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6307.8s)]
*  If people want to learn more about your research and your views on things, [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6312.4800000000005s)]
*  if they want to know about the 11 years you spent fighting the feds [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6319.2s)]
*  for blowing a whistle on them, where do they where do they get that information? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6323.0s)]
*  So we published the Soleri report at Soleri.com, S-O-L-A-R-I.com. [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6326.52s)]
*  And we have a subscription service and we have a lot of free, you know. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6332.080000000001s)]
*  So if you want to get to know us, you can come in and you can learn [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6336.64s)]
*  tremendous amounts from the free stuff. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6339.320000000001s)]
*  We'd love to have you as a subscriber. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6341.4800000000005s)]
*  And we have a great group of subscribers. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6343.8s)]
*  We have what happened to me was I I fell into this because I had terrible, [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6346.68s)]
*  terrible experiences with the corporate media. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6354.120000000001s)]
*  And and so I just started doing shows and giving out my email and saying, [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6356.92s)]
*  if you have a question, ask me. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6361.240000000001s)]
*  And over many years, the questions would come in and we'd publish the answers [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6363.160000000001s)]
*  and, you know, it'd go on and on and went on for free for a long time. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6367.120000000001s)]
*  And then finally I got so many questions that I would just, you know, [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6370.4800000000005s)]
*  I finally said I need to hire people. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6375.200000000001s)]
*  But we have this global network of subscribers and audience who get on the [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6377.400000000001s)]
*  site, share comments. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6382.6s)]
*  They're brilliant. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6383.84s)]
*  And we help each other figure, figure things out. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6384.68s)]
*  And we've literally become an intelligence network, you know, and it's all people [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6387.96s)]
*  who want to be free and they all understand one can't be free unless we're all free. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6392.6s)]
*  You know, this is an all or nothing thing. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6397.56s)]
*  They either get the control grid or we're free. [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6399.92s)]
*  And the only way we're going to be free is if everybody's free. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6402.52s)]
*  It's an all or nothing deal. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6405.120000000001s)]
*  And there are a lot of people now who understand this and are gathering. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6407.0s)]
*  And, you know, so I have many subscribers. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6411.16s)]
*  I don't I just know from what they say, I have many subscribers who are your [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6413.76s)]
*  subscribers because they feel and I feel you're on the same journey. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6417.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6421.32s)]
*  I'm just not a very systematic thinker. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6421.48s)]
*  So a lot of my instincts tell me that you're telling the truth. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6423.12s)]
*  And of course, I agree completely with your orientation. [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6427.32s)]
*  I just, my brain doesn't work that way. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6429.599999999999s)]
*  So it's been a true pleasure to hear all of this. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6431.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6435.88s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6436.72s)]
*  I, I love your work. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6437.599999999999s)]
*  So thank you. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6439.12s)]

*  Gatharawson Fitz. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6447.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6447.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6448.56s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6453.24s)]
*  That's not surprising. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6457.04s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6458.12s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6458.88s)]
*  right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8pA2TDXtew&t=6462.12s)]
