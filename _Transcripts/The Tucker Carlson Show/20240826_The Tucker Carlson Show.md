# RFK Jr Teaming up With Trump, Pavel Durov’s Arrest, CIA, and the Fall of the Democrat Party
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [August 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g)
*  We're honored to announce that JD Vance, the vice presidential nominee, is confirmed for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=0.0s)]
*  a live tour stop in Hershey, Pennsylvania next month. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4.8s)]
*  Tickets are on sale at TuckerCarlson.com. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=9.28s)]
*  We hope to see you there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=11.28s)]
*  We'll be in cities all across the country starting next week. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  But first, our interview with Bobby Kennedy Jr., his first since endorsing Donald Trump [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=16.34s)]
*  on Friday. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  So people were shocked. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=30.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people you know well were shocked when you endorsed Trump. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=43.84s)]
*  I was not shocked because for all the areas where you disagree on specific issues, there's [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=47.08s)]
*  a consistent theme that I have noticed in both of your lives, which is you've both spent [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=52.24s)]
*  the majority of your life, in your case, your whole life in the American ruling class, and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=56.92s)]
*  both of you decided that it was corrupt and that you were going to say so out loud at [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=62.6s)]
*  great risk, at great risk to both of you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=68.04s)]
*  And so it was probably just a matter of time before you aligned in some way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=71.44s)]
*  Is that how you see it? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=75.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=76.12s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, I think there's been a bunch of realignments, political realignments [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=77.12s)]
*  about four or five throughout American history. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=82.64s)]
*  And I think we're going through one right now with the Democratic Party and with both [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=86.48s)]
*  political parties really changing in this very dramatic way. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=91.32s)]
*  And you and I talked earlier about the transformation of the Republican Party and the party of environmentalism. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=94.68s)]
*  And you know, the Democratic Party has won out one environmental issue, which is carbon [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  orthodoxy, which ends up benefiting, you know, the oil companies and BlackRock and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=109.04s)]
*  Goldman Sachs with offshore wind and carbon capture, $100 billion carbon capture projects, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  which is part of just the strip mining of the middle class. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=125.0s)]
*  And that's the only issue you can talk about in the Democratic Party. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=128.32s)]
*  I got into the environmental movement to do habitat protection, to do wildlife conservation, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=131.24s)]
*  to get toxics out of our kids. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=136.36s)]
*  And none of these are issues that Democrats, the party itself, Democrats care about them, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  but the party itself doesn't. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  There's been these big, profound realignments and it's not only on that issue. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=147.08s)]
*  It's really the, you know, the domination of this, this corrupt merger of state and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=150.68s)]
*  corporate power that is happening in Washington, D.C. now, where our democracy has really been [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  subverted by the industries that have taken over the regulatory agencies and they've [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=165.72s)]
*  become, transformed them into sock puppets or corporate profit taking. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=172.0s)]
*  And basically wholly owned subsidiaries of the industries they're supposed to regulate. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=178.16s)]
*  And the Democrats, for a variety of reasons, and I watched it happen over many, many years, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=184.72s)]
*  have clung to this illusion of these Democratic institutions that they're still Democratic [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=193.35999999999999s)]
*  and they have a belief, we all have the capacity to judge ourselves on our intentions rather [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=199.64s)]
*  than our actions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=205.72s)]
*  Right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=206.72s)]
*  I've been there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=207.72s)]
*  So, and the Democratic Party judges itself, it sees itself, my friends who are Democrats, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=210.72s)]
*  see themselves as part of the good guys, the white hats, and that, you know, it's kind [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=219.32s)]
*  of like the good guys who are in Fort Apache surrounded by the, you know, the forces of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=225.6s)]
*  barbarism that are about to storm the gate and they're the only ones, the only way to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=234.16s)]
*  keep it at bay is to elect a president who has dementia. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=239.56s)]
*  Unless you're voting for the apparatus and you're not voting for, you know, or another [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=246.76s)]
*  president, then to hand pick a presidential candidate without any elections, to basically [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=252.0s)]
*  get rid of democracy in order to save it and hand pick a candidate who in 40 days now has [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=258.64s)]
*  not given a single interview on any media outlet. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=268.1s)]
*  I think about when my uncle and father would think about that, you know, they prided themselves [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=274.2s)]
*  on being able to go on debate, it was this centerpiece, you know, to hold, you know, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=278.68s)]
*  function of democracy was to anneal ideas in the furnace of debate and have them rise [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  up in the marketplace of ideas. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=292.24s)]
*  And the idea that, you know, and we had this British tradition of Churchill and the others [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=296.32s)]
*  in the House of Commons, you know, being able to defend their policies and being forced [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=303.64s)]
*  to defend their policies articulately, eloquently. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=308.88s)]
*  And you know, my uncle and father just thought we should, ideas are important and we should [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=313.76s)]
*  be able to defend them. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=320.0s)]
*  And if you can't defend them, there's something wrong with you. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=322.04s)]
*  And, you know, why, so we have a presidential candidate that was selected by the Democratic [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=326.08s)]
*  Party who can't do that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=332.04s)]
*  And you know, one of the things that my uncle and father were always thinking about is how [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=334.68s)]
*  do we look to the rest of the world, right? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=338.12s)]
*  They were conscious that America was the template for democracy. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=342.14s)]
*  When we created our modern democracy in 1789 or 1791 when the Bill of Rights was ratified, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=347.06s)]
*  we were the only democracy on earth. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=354.68s)]
*  By 1865, during the end of the Civil War, there were five and they were all modeled [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=357.68s)]
*  on America. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=363.6s)]
*  And by the time my uncle took office, it was about 150 and by the time by the end of the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=365.52s)]
*  60s, there's 190. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=371.52s)]
*  They're all based on American model. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=373.48s)]
*  And you know, we very much were the exemplary nation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=377.64s)]
*  We were the example of democracy around the globe and people and they were very conscious. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  They were, you know, they were embarrassed at first by the Civil Rights Movement because [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=386.3s)]
*  they said, what is the rest of the world going to think about it? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=390.74s)]
*  And then they realized, well, we better correct, you know, the problem. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=394.22s)]
*  But everything that they did, they were conscious, they were being watched. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=398.98s)]
*  What is the rest of the world think of American democracy right now? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=404.54s)]
*  We have in one party selected a man with dementia to lead the free world and then turned around [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=409.26s)]
*  and picked a person, a woman who cannot give an interview. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=421.5s)]
*  She cannot defend American, her vision or America's record in the world. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=427.22s)]
*  And then she gave this, you know, Vice President Harris gave this speech at the convention [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=433.86s)]
*  that was written by neocons and they had CIA directors talking at the Democratic convention, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=440.38s)]
*  military people talking at the Democratic convention. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=447.66s)]
*  My father and my uncle were the party of anti-war. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=451.26s)]
*  My uncle was asked by his best friend, Ben Bradley, one of his two best friends who ran [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=455.5s)]
*  Washington Post, what do you want on your graves, on your epithets? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  And my uncle said immediately he kept the peace. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=466.86s)]
*  He said the primary job of a president of the United States was to keep the country [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=469.78s)]
*  out of war. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=474.03999999999996s)]
*  He said he didn't want children in Africa and Latin America and Asia, when they heard [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  about the United States of America, to think of a man with a gun. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=481.21999999999997s)]
*  They wanted them to think of a Peace Corps volunteer and the Alliance for Progress and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=485.09999999999997s)]
*  USAID. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=489.06s)]
*  Which were programs that he created to build the middle class to end run the oligarchs, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=490.98s)]
*  end run the military hunters that used to receive the USAID. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=496.14s)]
*  And instead go directly to the poor and build institutions, education and health and all [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=500.86s)]
*  the institutions of democracy to continue to model it for the rest of the world and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=507.42s)]
*  live up to what we were supposed to be doing, which is to encourage the growth of democratic [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=511.98s)]
*  rule. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=518.78s)]
*  And now we have a system that's produced people who, a candidate in the Democratic [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=520.5s)]
*  Party who can't even defend America's record in the world and who is parroting this kind [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=531.02s)]
*  of warmongering military domination ideology that's gotten us in such trouble. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=539.9399999999999s)]
*  It's caused a calamity in our country. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=547.1800000000001s)]
*  It's gutted the middle class. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=550.22s)]
*  It's made us a pariah around the globe. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=551.72s)]
*  It's led to the rise of bricks. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=554.54s)]
*  It's leading to the rise of totalitarianism all over the world. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=557.9s)]
*  And you know, I'd say this finally, that if you really look at what's happening in the [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=562.34s)]
*  Democratic Party today, it's a party that, the word demos in Greek means people. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=568.74s)]
*  But it's a party that's lost faith in the people. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=575.5799999999999s)]
*  It's a party that needs ironclad control. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=578.14s)]
*  So they didn't trust anybody during, to have a real election. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=582.9399999999999s)]
*  They got rid of the primaries because they didn't trust the people. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=586.22s)]
*  They then picked, handpicked, Vice President Harris with no election, no even pretense [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=590.3399999999999s)]
*  of election because they didn't trust the people. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=595.74s)]
*  And you know, you have, and they're the party now of censorship. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=600.06s)]
*  How can you have a democracy with censorship? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=605.18s)]
*  You cannot have a democracy. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=607.9799999999999s)]
*  They're absolutely incompatible. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  And everybody knew that everybody, you know, you and I were raised reading Orwell and Alice [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  Huxley and, you know, Robert Heinlein and Alexander Solzhenitsyn and all of these other [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=617.9799999999999s)]
*  books that were part of classical literature that was taught in every American classroom. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=627.82s)]
*  It said the first step to totalitarianism is always, it begins with censorship. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=632.86s)]
*  It's the first step down that slippery slope. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=638.62s)]
*  There's no time that we look back in history and say the people who are censoring speech [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=641.66s)]
*  were the good guys. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=645.82s)]
*  They're always the bad guys because we knew, you know, we know that they're the guys who [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=647.42s)]
*  are going to end up cracking the whip on us all and, you know, being our overlords. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=652.38s)]
*  And then, you know, the whole thing about, like you and I have talked about that clip [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=660.22s)]
*  of Tim Waltz, Governor Waltz saying that government should be the ultimate arbiter of what is [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=667.18s)]
*  protected speech and what is not. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=677.02s)]
*  You know, he said if something that the First Amendment does not protect, misinformation [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=679.58s)]
*  and disinformation, but it does. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=685.1800000000001s)]
*  The First Amendment was written to protect not only true speech but false speech and [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=687.6600000000001s)]
*  speech that not, it wasn't there and it's unnecessary to protect the kind of speech [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=695.0200000000001s)]
*  that everybody wants to hear. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=701.1s)]
*  It's there to protect the kind of speech that nobody wants to hear. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=703.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=705.98s)]
*  And especially speech that is critical of the people in charge. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=706.38s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=710.0600000000001s)]
*  And so in their current formulation, misinformation is defined as any speech that criticizes [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=710.46s)]
*  the job that they're doing. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=715.5s)]
*  So with that in mind, you see the Biden administration encouraging France, Macron, to arrest the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=716.94s)]
*  owner and founder of Telegram, Pavel Durov, who's now, as of right now, in a French prison. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=723.82s)]
*  That seems like, I mean, that's the hallmark of dictatorship, it sounds to me. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, you know, we've lost Europe. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=734.6999999999999s)]
*  Europe is now, does not have free speech. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=738.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, look what's happened to Elon Musk. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=742.2199999999999s)]
*  And Elon Musk should be the hero of the Democratic Party. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=743.9799999999999s)]
*  The old Democratic Party, he wouldn't be the hero. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=746.8599999999999s)]
*  Somehow he became a villain because he was actually the only platform that would allow [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=750.14s)]
*  free speech on his platform. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=755.5799999999999s)]
*  And he's now become a villain because of it because the Democratic Party does not believe [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=758.06s)]
*  in the people. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=762.54s)]
*  If you don't believe in free speech, it means because you don't trust the people, you don't [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=763.18s)]
*  trust them to figure it out on their own, you know, to have information on which they [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=769.3399999999999s)]
*  can base their ideas and their notions and their beliefs. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=776.62s)]
*  And their votes. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=780.4599999999999s)]
*  And their votes, and that the government has to protect them from dangerous information, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=781.26s)]
*  from things that might put bad ideas into their heads. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=788.14s)]
*  And it's very patronizing, but it's also very manipulative and conniving. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=791.5s)]
*  And really, it's exactly the opposite of democracy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=797.8199999999999s)]
*  And you will not find a single Democrat who will criticize it. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=801.26s)]
*  It's really astonishing to me because the Democrats always like to, you know, when I [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=809.02s)]
*  endorse Trump, the big, you know, the big kind of the fulcrum of the centerpiece of the [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=816.0600000000001s)]
*  text of hatred that I got back, this kind of seething anger, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=822.86s)]
*  I'm so many Democrats, we'll look what he did on January 6th. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=827.5s)]
*  Okay, January 6th was a bad day in American history. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=831.74s)]
*  And what President Trump did there, in my view, was very bad. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=836.0600000000001s)]
*  It was reprehensible. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=843.26s)]
*  But was the republic really at risk? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=845.4200000000001s)]
*  You know, we have the US military, we have the National Guard, you have, you know, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=850.62s)]
*  they have all the institutions, we have Congress, we have all these institutions of government. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=855.9s)]
*  And there was a mob of people, most of them probably didn't know what was happening. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=861.1s)]
*  Some of them were very badly intentioned, we're breaking the law. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=866.0600000000001s)]
*  But it wasn't a threat to the republic. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=870.14s)]
*  What is a threat, and this is what you cannot explain to a Democrat now, and it's astonishing [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=873.58s)]
*  to me. What is a threat is when the government is censoring your speech, political speech. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=879.1800000000001s)]
*  And you know, I just won Tucker last week. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=886.38s)]
*  But that was the centerpiece of Democratic ideology was free speech. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=889.1800000000001s)]
*  Exactly. I mean, the word liberal means free speech. That's where it comes from. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=893.4200000000001s)]
*  Oh, is that must be weird for you being named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and spending your entire [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=897.82s)]
*  life in this world? Like what? What's that like? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=903.42s)]
*  I mean, that, you know, let me just say this. I won a lawsuit. I won a new judgment and my lawsuit, [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=910.78s)]
*  Kennedy versus Biden last week. And Kennedy versus Biden was part of two lawsuits that were brought, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=921.9s)]
*  one by the attorney generals of Missouri and Louisiana and the other by me for the same [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=930.14s)]
*  issues, which was the Biden administration's censorship of speech. And so there's a series [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=935.3399999999999s)]
*  of decisions. There's a hundred and fifty five page decision. The attorney general's case went up to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=939.7399999999999s)]
*  the Supreme Court and was rejected because they, the Supreme Court found that those attorney [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=945.5799999999999s)]
*  generals didn't have standing to sue because they weren't directly harmed. My case this week, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=952.06s)]
*  the federal judge Doty said Kennedy does have standing to sue. And he reinforced, reissued his [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=957.66s)]
*  injunction against the Biden administration. Oh, I have an injunction right now against the [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  Biden White House and join them from censoring me, which they've been doing. The hundred and [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=972.6999999999999s)]
*  fifty five page decision by Judge Doty details everything that happened. Thirty seven hours [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=979.66s)]
*  after he took the oath of office, President Biden's White House opened up a portal for the FBI [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=986.14s)]
*  to begin to have access to social media posts on all the different social media sites. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=993.42s)]
*  And they, the FBI then invited in the CIA, DHS, the IRS, and CISA. CISA is this new agency that is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1000.86s)]
*  the center of the censorship industrial complex that is in charge of making sure Americans don't [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1013.42s)]
*  hear things that their government doesn't want them to hear. And those agencies and other agencies, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1020.14s)]
*  including the health agencies like CDC, were given access to go into the social media sites [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1026.86s)]
*  and change posts and slow walk things and shadow ban posts. That it was part of that effort. And [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1032.46s)]
*  they removed my Instagram account. I had almost a million followers. I they say it was for [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1042.06s)]
*  misinformation, but they could not point to a single post that I ever made. That was factually [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1047.6599999999999s)]
*  erroneous. And they actually Facebook pushed back in the email chain. You can see Facebook pushing [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1053.4199999999998s)]
*  back at the White House and saying, well, wait a minute. He's not this isn't misinformation. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1059.82s)]
*  This is not factually erroneous. What they're saying is actually true. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1066.8600000000001s)]
*  And they had to invent a new word, which is called malinformation, which is information that is [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1071.26s)]
*  factually true, but nevertheless inconvenient for the government. And that became disinformation, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1076.94s)]
*  misinformation, and malinformation. That's what that is. So everybody and, and [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1081.82s)]
*  isn't that illegal? That's illegal. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1088.22s)]
*  Yeah. And the, and the emails show that Facebook, the people said this, these, they were saying [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1089.42s)]
*  about the White House and their private emails with each other. These people are cynical, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1095.98s)]
*  you know, terrible people and they knew what they were doing was breaking the law. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1101.5s)]
*  But they were under tremendous pressure. Facebook has all these deals with the government and, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1106.6200000000001s)]
*  you know, as do all the media companies with the intelligence agencies and elsewhere. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1111.1000000000001s)]
*  Plus they were the White House was overtly telling them that they were going to, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1117.26s)]
*  if they didn't comply, that their section 230 immunity was in jeopardy. Section 230 immunity [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1126.94s)]
*  is the, you know, is, is just so that your listeners know what it is. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1135.4199999999998s)]
*  And the other thing is I used to write for the New York times regularly. Every time I wrote [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1141.26s)]
*  an article, lawyers would call me and fact check everything in that article. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1149.82s)]
*  Because if I wrote something that was defamatory in that article [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1155.02s)]
*  and somebody was defamed, that person could sue me, but they could also sue the New York Times. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1159.66s)]
*  Oh, the social media site said we cannot hire lawyers to look at every post and call the people [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1166.3000000000002s)]
*  and check on it when, you know, on Facebook or Instagram. So if this industry is going to [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1174.54s)]
*  function, we need to be able to not be liable for what is published on our site. And that is called [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1180.8600000000001s)]
*  Section 230 of the Communications Act. Congress said if you are just a platform, a mere platform [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1188.78s)]
*  that for other people to publish, like Facebook is, like Instagram, like Twitter or X, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1196.78s)]
*  that you're immune. Nobody can sue you. They can sue the person who wrote the post, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1204.46s)]
*  but they can't sue Facebook. So Mark Zuckerberg said if they take away our Facebook, our Section [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1209.1s)]
*  230 immunity, it is existential, meaning we will no longer exist. And so they were terrified [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1217.66s)]
*  because Congress was actually considering removing Section 230 immunity and the White House was [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1224.3000000000002s)]
*  telling them if you don't censor our political critics, we're going to take away your Section [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1228.94s)]
*  230 immunity. If President Trump did that, the Democrats would go berserk. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1234.94s)]
*  Google, that's criminal behavior. It does that as a criminal. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1241.9s)]
*  Right. They're violating the First Amendment, the Constitution for starters. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1244.7s)]
*  And so that's what happened. And, you know, my idea is that if somebody does something bad, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1250.8600000000001s)]
*  it shouldn't matter whether they're Democrat or Republican. It is, you know, we should all be [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1259.26s)]
*  going after them and we should be going after them as a society. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1263.5s)]
*  How much does it cost you to use the Internet? Well, it's free, right? Google's free. Facebook [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1266.94s)]
*  is free. Instagram, totally free. That's what you've been convinced of, but it's a trick. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1273.02s)]
*  None of it is free. In fact, you're paying with your data. Everything you do online can be seen [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1280.38s)]
*  and sold, not just to companies, but to governments, including foreign governments, [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1289.66s)]
*  and often is. So how do you reclaim your online privacy? It's important. Well, there is one way. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1294.7s)]
*  It's called encryption. Strong encryption protects your right to privacy online and [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1300.7s)]
*  defends you from your many potential enemies online, including your own government. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1306.06s)]
*  And it gives you back the freedom to read what you want, to write what you want without prying [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1310.46s)]
*  eyes spying on you. So how do you get this freedom through encryption? I'll tell you how we do it. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1316.14s)]
*  Express VPN reroutes 100% of our online activity through secure encrypted servers. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1321.34s)]
*  Now, normally, if we didn't use it, Internet providers would be able to read and see everything [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1329.98s)]
*  that we do online. In the United States, they could even sell it, as we said. But because we [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1334.6999999999998s)]
*  use Express VPN, they can't see any of it, 0% approximately. We also use it when we travel [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1339.82s)]
*  abroad because that same encryption shuts out hackers and might try and steal what we're doing, [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1345.58s)]
*  things like passwords or credit card details over sketchy Wi-Fi, free Wi-Fi. That's not free either. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1350.54s)]
*  It also shuts out foreign governments and might try and spy on us or censor what we're doing [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1356.62s)]
*  online. What we especially like about Express VPN is they're not a black box that promises privacy [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1360.54s)]
*  and tech solutions. We have to trust them. They've actually opened up their servers to [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1366.46s)]
*  professional auditors at PWC and KPMG, as well as independent security experts to evaluate the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1371.18s)]
*  claims they're making about what they're doing, their privacy policy and their trusted server [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1377.34s)]
*  technology. So people are watching them. So it's a carefully designed server architecture that runs [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1381.58s)]
*  on volatile memory only. That means it never stores user data because it cannot store user data. It's [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1389.74s)]
*  impossible. It's private by design. They couldn't keep your stuff if they wanted to. So in a world [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1396.54s)]
*  where it seems like every corporation wants more and more of your private information to sell and [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1402.3s)]
*  manipulate, it's nice to find a company that actually goes the extra mile to protect it. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1406.94s)]
*  That's their business, protecting your privacy. So if you want freedom online, and freedom means [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1411.5s)]
*  privacy, there's never been a better time to get it through Express VPN. You can use our special [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1417.18s)]
*  link to get three extra months of Express VPN for free. They express vpn.com slash tucker. That's [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1422.06s)]
*  express, E-X-P-R-E-S-S, vpn.com slash tucker. What I don't understand, and it is baffling to me, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1428.3s)]
*  having known a lot of Democrats, but you've been in that world your whole life, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1435.82s)]
*  how do they not see that? How do people who say they believe in civil liberties suddenly think [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1440.22s)]
*  it's okay for the government to prosecute its political opponents and silence them? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1445.98s)]
*  How do they think that? To me, I've thought a lot about that. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1452.06s)]
*  I bet. And it's about tribalism. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1457.82s)]
*  And that people put themselves in these tribal categories, and we're hardwired for tribalism. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1462.3799999999999s)]
*  That's why orthodoxies are so popular, that people get sucked into various kind of orthodoxies, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1468.62s)]
*  whether it's ideological orthodoxies or religious orthodoxies. And that impulse is not a religious [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1475.6599999999999s)]
*  impulse. It's a biological impulse. And it's an impulse that's hardwired in us from the 20,000 [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1483.5s)]
*  generations we spent wandering the African savanna and tiny little groups that were [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1490.06s)]
*  warring each other where there was always a male leader, where the women were traded as chattels [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1495.1s)]
*  because she couldn't marry her sister. So you knew from the beginning she was going to be a trade [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1502.1399999999999s)]
*  good, and you were going to trade her for somebody else. She had no power. And where you all had to [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1506.1399999999999s)]
*  ascribe to an orthodoxy and see no problems with people who were within your in-group, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1514.94s)]
*  and people who were outside were subhuman and they could be killed. And if they made a mistake, [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1521.9s)]
*  you wanted to talk about it. Everybody would talk about it. We're all hardwired that way, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1527.3400000000001s)]
*  because that's where our wiring comes from. And when somebody gets subsumed in an orthodoxy, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1533.02s)]
*  it's very, very difficult to unravel. And there are all kinds of psychiatric treatises about how [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1539.4199999999998s)]
*  do you deprogram somebody? How do you talk somebody out of an orthodoxy? And the little [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1546.4599999999998s)]
*  that I know about it is that if you challenge them directly, it pours concrete on it. And it makes [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1556.06s)]
*  them less able to move off. They get very defensive. And the way to approach them, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1564.7s)]
*  there are ways to approach them. There's deprogramming protocols, and they usually include [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1569.82s)]
*  a lot of Socratic method of asking them questions about their beliefs. But it's a one-on-one [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1575.66s)]
*  project enterprise, and it's not something that you can do with the whole Democratic Party over [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1585.74s)]
*  night. Something has to happen that's going to make this tribal thinking unravel, because it's [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1591.8200000000002s)]
*  really destroying our country. And the polarization, what's happening on both sides, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1597.8200000000002s)]
*  is put on steroids by these social media algorithms that reward people for staying on the site as long [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1603.8200000000002s)]
*  as possible. So the algorithm, all the algorithm knows is I've got to keep as many eyeballs on the [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1614.94s)]
*  site as possible. It turns out that the way people stay on the site is if you fortify their existing [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1620.94s)]
*  opinions, if you feed them information that consolidates their worldview. And so we have [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1628.3s)]
*  this problem now where it's not just polarization like the Civil War, but it's also the same [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1637.66s)]
*  polarization like the Civil War, but it's polarization on steroids because you've got [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1643.02s)]
*  machines that are manipulating us to hate each other more every single day. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1647.66s)]
*  So knowing all this as you do and have for a long time, the most radical step you can make if you're [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1652.86s)]
*  a Democrat is endorsing Donald Trump. So there are political calculations involved, there are [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1659.5s)]
*  ideological calculations, but there are also, of course, personal calculations. So you know once [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1664.62s)]
*  you do that, you've burned your boats, like that's it. You're not going back to wherever you were [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1669.74s)]
*  10 years ago. How hard a decision was that for you personally? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1673.58s)]
*  It was a very good, it was an obvious decision for me. It should have been, but it was a very, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1677.82s)]
*  very difficult decision. And we had, you know, I have a very, very good team around me and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1684.22s)]
*  I was most worried about my wife, who was, about Cheryl, you know, who, you know, it was not [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1689.1s)]
*  comfortable with it. She is a, you know, lifelong Democrat. She comes from, not the aristocracy, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1700.2199999999998s)]
*  she comes from a very, you know, I would say poor family in North Florida, but she founded her way [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1706.54s)]
*  through idealism to the Democratic Party and that, and she shares a lot of those values. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1715.74s)]
*  And her industry is very, very much aligned with the Democratic Party, probably more than any [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1724.46s)]
*  industry in our country and more than any town in our country. So this, for me, was like, you know, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1731.66s)]
*  huge impacts on her. And ultimately, if she had told me, you can't do this, I wouldn't have done [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1740.22s)]
*  it. So, but I'm very grateful that she overcame, she allowed me to do it. She was not embracing it, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1746.22s)]
*  but she said, I understand why you have to do this. And her, and we had a four-day meeting and [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1757.58s)]
*  up in Hyannisport, my home, where kind of everybody, my family members, my kids, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1765.5s)]
*  many other people, Tony Robbins, I attended remotely and a number of other kind of spiritual [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1771.34s)]
*  leaders, just people who cared deeply about our country, chimed in and made case on both sides. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1780.38s)]
*  People from the campaign organization did. But here was a calculus that ultimately was persuasive [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1789.6599999999999s)]
*  for me. My, if I, all of our internal polling showed from the outset, and if I say it in the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1796.6999999999998s)]
*  Democratic Party, I was going to get Vice President Harris elected, 57 to 60 percent and even more, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1806.06s)]
*  sometimes up to 66 percent of my voters. So my followers said that if I withdrew from the election, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1815.98s)]
*  they were going to vote for Trump, which is ironic, by the way, Tucker, because President Trump and [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1824.3799999999999s)]
*  the RNC did nothing to prevent me from being on the ballots. They didn't have a big, major organization [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1830.62s)]
*  sending private eyes out. I, the Democratic Party, was interviewing literally everybody I've ever met [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1839.82s)]
*  in 70 years to collect dirt on me. I got a call. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1848.54s)]
*  They've been doing that, I know for a fact, for over a year, as you know. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1853.18s)]
*  Yeah. And they were open about it. This is what we're going to do. They put a person in charge, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1856.86s)]
*  named Liz Smith, who's, you know, that's the kind of person she is. She does negative research on [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1861.98s)]
*  people and tries to characterize them. Liz Smith, Elliot Spitzer's old girlfriend? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1871.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes. And she was in charge of that team. And then there was other people as well, [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1874.38s)]
*  Mary Beth Cahill had been my uncle, Teddy Sheevesav, who I know. Liz Smith was in charge of [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1879.9s)]
*  you know, the negative research, what they call negative research, euphemistically. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1887.18s)]
*  And I got calls from, you know, for example, a guy that I met at an AA meeting 40 years ago, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1892.14s)]
*  and he received a call. Most of my family members received calls on contacts, either texts [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1899.42s)]
*  or telephone calls from people who said, I'm doing intelligence for the DNC, and you know, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1905.5s)]
*  we'd like to talk to you about Robert Kennedy. And if you have any negative information about him. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1911.26s)]
*  So I was getting that, you know, what could possibly be the justification for that? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1918.22s)]
*  Well, they didn't want me running. And that's the thing is, it's not [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1923.1s)]
*  democratic. It wasn't, you know, that's such a mafia tactic. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1926.46s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, but the point is, it was weird. It was it was not smart because I was [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1930.62s)]
*  actually helping the Democrats. And if they just want me to stay in and they didn't run this [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1939.1s)]
*  campaign against me, they probably would win this election. And because I was hurting Trump, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1943.74s)]
*  oddly, Trump didn't do anything about it. He's, you know, he was kind of, he made a couple of [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1951.1s)]
*  statements about me that I was a communist, etc. They were sort of good natured, you know, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1957.6599999999999s)]
*  the stuff that you're like, okay, that's okay. They weren't like calling my old girlfriend saying, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1963.74s)]
*  you know, what, you know, what did he do? Or, you know, whatever they were asking him. So, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1970.94s)]
*  but the DNC was up to that. And, and were you shocked by that? [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1980.5400000000002s)]
*  Was I shocked? I don't know. I mean, I was, I'm, I feel like I'm, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=1987.58s)]
*  I'm in a place now and nothing surprises me. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2001.26s)]
*  I bet you are. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2004.9399999999998s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, anyway, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2005.9s)]
*  So they're going to drop all that stuff now, obviously, right? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2016.94s)]
*  What? Are they going to get rid of Liz Smith and put her on some other project? I don't know. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2020.5400000000002s)]
*  You sort of wonder how does Liz Smith live with herself. I mean, that's so repulsive. Like, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2026.6200000000001s)]
*  how does she justify that to herself? I have to, I mean, I met her, she's not stupid. But [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2030.86s)]
*  that is disgusting. No, I mean, you've lived a life famously. And if you have a team of researchers [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2036.06s)]

*  my first, during my announcement speech, I said, you know, I had told my wife, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2049.98s)]
*  that I told Cheryl this couple days before I said, I have so many skeletons in my closet, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2054.2999999999997s)]

*  me because I led, let me put it, a colorful life. And, you know, people have all kinds of stories [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2065.02s)]
*  about me. But so I was, I'm ready for, you know, I'm ready for, I was, I never done anything criminal [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2072.38s)]
*  in terms of like stealing money or self-enrichment. I did a lot of stupid stuff and a lot of- [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2079.82s)]
*  Have you gotten rich off pointless foreign wars? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2086.06s)]
*  No, I have not done that. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2088.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, you haven't. Okay. You haven't forced people to inject [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2090.06s)]
*  substances in their bodies. Okay. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2094.06s)]
*  No, I've never done that. But anyway, so it became clear to me that if, if Kamala got elected, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2095.74s)]
*  the issues that I cared about, which is ending the foreign wars, you know, the unjust wars, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2104.46s)]
*  immoral wars, the wars of choice like Ukraine, stopping the censorship, which I think is [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2112.2200000000003s)]
*  existential for our democracy, and then protecting children from this extraordinary, exploding [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2118.5400000000004s)]
*  chronic disease epidemic. Those are the three reasons that got me into the campaign. That's [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2125.7400000000002s)]
*  why I ran for president. Those are three reasons. And if she got elected, I'm 70 years old, that [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2129.82s)]
*  eight years from now, our kids are going to be lost. And that, and if she's president for eight [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2138.06s)]
*  years, my chance to do anything about it would be gone. And that, and then I got a contact from [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2143.5s)]
*  Callie Means who you know well, you've made one of the best shows ever put on TV, ever aired was [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2151.1s)]
*  your interview with Callie and his wife, Casey and Callie, for those of you who haven't seen the show, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2158.7799999999997s)]
*  his show is a, is an expert, a genius, brilliant, articulate, eloquent, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2165.6600000000003s)]
*  and incredible, and encyclopedic knowledge on the food system and what is corrupting it, what is [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2173.82s)]
*  causing the corruption at FDA, at USDA, that the capture of those agencies by the processed food [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2179.5s)]
*  industry, by the chemical industry, by the pharmaceutical industry, that actually profit [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2188.1400000000003s)]
*  on sick children. One of the things that Callie says, there is nothing more profitable in our [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2193.58s)]
*  society today than a sick child because it, all of these entities are making money on them. The [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2199.2599999999998s)]
*  insurance companies, the hospitals, the medical cartel, the pharmaceutical companies have a [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2205.1s)]
*  lifetime annuities. I mean, any child that, and their earlier that kid is sick, they don't want [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2210.06s)]
*  to kill him. They want him sick for the rest of their lives. And we have now a whole generation, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2215.58s)]
*  when my uncle was president, 6% of Americans had chronic disease. Today it's 60%. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2220.86s)]
*  When my uncle was president, do you know what the, the cause, the annual cost of treating chronic [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2227.7400000000002s)]
*  disease was in this country? Zero. There weren't even any drugs invented for it. Zero. Today it's [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2234.86s)]
*  about $4.3 trillion. When your uncle was president, and none of it is necessary. What was the autism [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2242.86s)]
*  rate in 1960? In 1960, the autism rate, there's about four, five studies. And the, the, the, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2248.3s)]
*  the highest rates say about one in 2500, one in 1500, one in 2500, one in 10,000. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2257.1800000000003s)]
*  So that, you know, it was, it was somewhere between one in 1500 and one in 10,000. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2266.78s)]
*  Today it's one in every 34 kids, according to the CDC. And in some states like California, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2272.06s)]
*  I think maybe Utah and New Jersey, one in 22, one in 22 kids. And, you know, these kids should be [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2277.9s)]
*  healthy. These kids shouldn't be our highest performing kids. And they instead are, are, you [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2285.1s)]
*  know, have this extraordinary disability that's going to keep them dependent. And not, you know, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2293.02s)]
*  a lot of these, if you're full blown autism, you know, it's a nonverbal, non-toilet trained, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2299.26s)]
*  head banging, stimming, toe walking. These are kids that will never throw baseball. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2304.78s)]
*  They'll never graduate high school. They'll never go out, take a girl on a date. They'll never use [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2311.82s)]
*  the toilet alone. They'll, they'll never write a play. They'll never write a poem. They'll never [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2317.98s)]
*  vote. Never have children. Never pay taxes. Here's something you may not have known. Back in 2015, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2324.46s)]
*  the Congress of the United States repealed something called the Country of Origin Labeling Act. Now, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2330.78s)]
*  why is this relevant to you? Well, it means among other things that when you buy beef at the [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2336.2200000000003s)]
*  supermarket that says made in the USA, it may not actually be. In fact, it could be likely is from a [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2340.54s)]
*  foreign country. It means that repackaging foreign meat can be enough to get the Made in USA [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2347.66s)]
*  designation. It's a lie. It's an absolute lie. Most people don't even know what's happening. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2355.18s)]
*  So how can you be sure that the meat you're eating is from the United States and has been raised with [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2359.18s)]
*  the highest quality standards and is the tastiest? It's truly made here. Well, it's simple. You can [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2363.74s)]
*  go to our friends at Merriwether Farms. Merriwether Farms is an American small business. It's based in [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2368.7799999999997s)]
*  Riverton, Wyoming. We know the people who run it and they're great people and they have great meat. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2373.5s)]
*  They ship the highest quality meat raised free from growth hormones and antibiotics directly to [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2378.3s)]
*  your doorstep. It's delicious. We eat it a lot, including at this table. These are Americans. These [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2384.14s)]
*  are American made products. And because they're cutting out the grocery store middlemen, their [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2389.82s)]
*  prices are actually cheaper, 10 to 30% cheaper for the best meat. They are the real deal. Again, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2393.5s)]
*  we eat that meat at this table from Riverton, Wyoming. They're the best. Merriwetherfarms.com. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2398.54s)]
*  Use the discount code TUCKER10 and you get an extra 10% off. Again, that's Merriwetherfarms. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2404.54s)]
*  M-E-R-I-W-E-T-H-E-R. Farms.com. It's worth it. So that just seems like such an emergency. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2410.7799999999997s)]
*  For me, yeah. For me, like if I could save one of these kids, it would be worth giving my life for. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2421.34s)]
*  I'm 70 years old. To save one kid at birth, it would be worth dying for. And to the opportunity [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2427.18s)]
*  and need for me to save all of these kids, I would do anything for. I would literally do anything for. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2435.8199999999997s)]
*  We were talking about breakfast. I'm sure your perception is different because we're talking [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2444.54s)]
*  about you. But for 15 years anyway, there was not a single story about you that didn't dismiss you [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2447.8199999999997s)]
*  as a dangerous crackpot for questioning why autism is much more common than it once was. Much more. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2455.58s)]
*  I mean, exponentially more common. And you've written a lot about this and you were attacked. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2461.9s)]
*  I don't see those attacks very much anymore. Well, they're still in the mainstream media. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2466.38s)]
*  That's still part of the litany of my crimes. But anybody who uses their head, and that's one of the [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2470.86s)]
*  reasons they won't let me speak on the media. I mean, when Ross Perot ran, he was running for 10 months. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2481.5s)]
*  He was on mainstream media 34 times interviews. And you remember him. It seemed like he was on [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2490.38s)]
*  Larry King every week. Of course. And I got in 16 months, I had two live interviews on all of those [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2497.58s)]
*  networks. ABC, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, too. And they're just basically mouthpieces now for the DNC. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2504.94s)]
*  And there was this obligatory litany of defamation and pejoratives that were used to describe me [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2517.98s)]
*  any time I mentioned my name was mentioned, that I was not a crackpot. And I was like a super villain. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2523.82s)]
*  And I'm not complaining because that's just, you know, I knew what I was getting into. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2531.8999999999996s)]
*  But anyway, the idea that, you know, I had these meetings with President Trump, and they were [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2538.62s)]
*  partly because of you. You know, you were the one who, Cali Mains called me about, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2546.2999999999997s)]
*  I'd say three hours after President Trump was shot. Cali Mains called, although it doesn't [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2552.14s)]
*  seem possible because, but I think it was only three hours after his shooting. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2558.54s)]
*  And Saturday night. Yeah, Saturday night. And Cali Mains said to me, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2566.06s)]
*  you know, he told me, Cali had been advising me for a long time, in my campaign. He told me that [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2574.94s)]
*  night I've also been, I've been advising President Trump, which delighted me because I thought, oh, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2582.22s)]
*  my gosh, there's another candidate beside me that is listening to the truth. And he said that, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2590.2999999999997s)]
*  that there was interest in the Trump campaign by the president of including me. And then he [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2599.5s)]
*  talked about vice president, which I wasn't interested in. And, but he said, you know, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2606.54s)]
*  would you be interested in talking with Trump, with President Trump? And I said, I don't think so. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2614.14s)]
*  And part of this was, I just thought it was a non-start, it was Cheryl. And I called Cheryl up [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2622.38s)]
*  and she said to me, you should hear them out. And I immediately called Cali, I texted Cali back and [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2628.54s)]
*  said, I'm interested. And then I got a text from you. And you and I have each other cell phones. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2638.7s)]
*  And you had an unknown cell phone number, which you had linked me into, which was President Trump's [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2647.34s)]
*  number. And you said, you know, he's waiting for your call. And so I called him that night. I had [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2652.86s)]
*  a great conversation with him. And then he, and he asked, we decided to talk. And I met him the [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2658.7000000000003s)]
*  next day. He was at that point at Bedminister, which is his golf course and home in New Jersey. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2667.9s)]
*  And he had driven there from Butler, where he had been shot. And then I went to, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2675.98s)]
*  and so I flew out to Minneapolis the next day. And I had a, probably a two hour meeting with him. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2683.34s)]
*  And Amaryllis is my daughter-in-law who is running my campaign, the smartest person I've ever met. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2691.98s)]
*  And Cheryl and Susie Wiles. And it was a really interesting meeting because he was so open about, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2697.26s)]
*  about first of all, not liking the neocons. And, you know, I never imagined that because I, you [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2711.34s)]
*  know, for me, he was the guy who brought John Bolton and Mike Pompeo into office. And, you know, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2720.54s)]
*  but he was really disillusioned with them, to say the least, you know. And then, you know, he was, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2727.2599999999998s)]
*  he was deeply interested and well informed as he is on any, you know, as much as he is on any subject [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2736.54s)]
*  about what's happening to our kids, chronic disease. And then he was absolutely adamant about stopping [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2746.7s)]
*  the censorship and, you know, and making sure that we had free speech. And so we talked a little then [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2754.78s)]
*  and didn't really come to any, you know, talked about the possibility of working together. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2762.3s)]
*  After that, and then, but then we, we put it on hold. They wanted me to do something at the [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2769.34s)]
*  convention. I said, no, I'm not going to do that. And, and we still, at that point, there was still [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2775.02s)]
*  a chance that I could get into the debate. That chance was diminishing. And because I was not [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2782.3s)]
*  allowed on any media and because, you know, my really, my only chance of winning the election, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2789.18s)]
*  I believe I would have won if I had gotten on the debate stage. But my only chance was to get on the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2797.1s)]
*  debate stage. And it was, that was that possibility was vanishing. And so I was looking at kind of my [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2802.3s)]
*  options. I then contacted Harris's campaign because I thought I should talk to them and see if they're [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2813.5s)]
*  interested in any of these issues, which I suspected they were not because Camelot was still an empty, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2820.94s)]
*  you know, an empty slate. Camelot, excuse me, was empty slate. So, you know, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2827.66s)]
*  She's pronounced it both ways herself. So it's okay. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2834.7799999999997s)]
*  It's, you know, I want to, I want to respect people and give them, you know. So [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2837.58s)]
*  I reached out to her and I reached out to a number of people, including some relatives of mine, [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2849.02s)]
*  very, very close to her personally and to the Democratic Party. And they just said, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2855.66s)]
*  that's an onslaught. There's no way in the world that she's going to talk to you. And they said, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2860.2999999999997s)]
*  we can get you a meeting with a low level campaign official. And I said, okay, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2865.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm not interested in that. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2872.62s)]
*  Why wouldn't, it's interesting. Why wouldn't Camelot Harris meet with you? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2874.54s)]
*  Maybe the same reason that she hasn't given an interview. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2879.98s)]
*  You know, I think it seems to me that there's a lot of handlers involved [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2883.26s)]
*  and that, and, you know, even when you talk to Democrats about, you know, do you really think [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2888.6200000000003s)]
*  it's a good idea to be electing somebody who cannot give an interview, they say, well, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2894.46s)]
*  you're not electing her. You're electing the people around her. You're electing the apparatus [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2900.86s)]
*  and the apparatus, but the apparatus, an apparatus, I don't have any faith in it. It's an apparatus [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2905.5s)]
*  that are neocons like, you know, like Anthony Blinken and, and who are, you know, running us [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2910.7s)]
*  right up into a world war three. And there are people who, you know, who mastermind the censorship [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2919.2599999999998s)]
*  from inside the white house. That's the apparatus that they want to reelect. And to me, that's an [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2925.3399999999997s)]
*  apparatus that has no appeal. These are the people who are censoring me. Here's the people who try [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2931.1s)]
*  to throw me out of the party who canceled the primaries. That's the apparatus. You know, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2935.1s)]
*  if it was a Democrat who said, I can think on my own, I understand what this country is supposed [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2940.94s)]
*  to look like. I understand what, what democracy is supposed to look like. And I, you know, then I [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2947.1s)]
*  think that's great. Let's do that. But it's just, it's strange from her perspective. First of all, [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2953.1s)]
*  electing the apparatus is not how democracy works. That's an oligarchy, just in point of fact, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2958.7799999999997s)]
*  but as a political calculation, your presence in the race running third party hurt Trump. No [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2963.82s)]
*  one disputes that. The polling's really clear on that. So if you were the Harris campaign, [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2969.42s)]
*  kind of a win, right? To get some alignment with you. Why even human curiosity you'd think would [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2974.94s)]
*  compel her to want to meet with you, like take a meeting, like, why do you care? But she didn't [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2982.38s)]
*  even talk to you. I think that's, I think it's very weird. It's weird, but not, I mean, I can't [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2986.3s)]
*  stress this, not, not being able to give an interview. I mean, your, your whole life is in [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2991.9s)]
*  public life. That's what you do. That is the currency. I give, I give, you know, this day is [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=2998.3s)]
*  a really slow day because I'm doing one interview with you. And on a typical day, I do about seven [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3005.7400000000002s)]
*  or eight interviews, some days 10 or 12. And I do that every day. And I've done that for 16 months. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3011.6600000000003s)]
*  If anybody wants to go, I mean, we have Liz now 4,000 people want to interview me, but we're, [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3019.02s)]
*  I'm interviewing as many people as possible. I want to get my voice out, my vision out, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3024.3799999999997s)]
*  my concerns out. And I, it's incomprehensible to me that you would be in public life. And, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3030.46s)]
*  and president Trump does the same thing. He's not scared of an interview. No, he likes it. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3041.58s)]
*  Theovon. Yeah. He's on you. He's done. He does anybody. He does people who don't agree with him. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3045.98s)]
*  He's not, he's not censoring you. No, he's doing, you know, he's talking to reporters who write [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3052.46s)]
*  crappy articles about them all the time, you know, from, from New York magazine. Maggie Haberman at [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3060.86s)]
*  the New York Times. New York, Maggie Haberman has never written a nice word about Donald Trump. And [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3066.94s)]
*  he talks to her how often? A lot. Yeah, a lot. So, you know, it's, you know, my uncle Teddy, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3072.22s)]
*  who was exactly opposite of Ronald Reagan, ideologically, and he ran against Carter. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3083.74s)]
*  Yeah. Daddy did. And Carter and he had an antipathy toward each other that was almost, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3091.98s)]
*  you know, like nothing I'd ever seen. Teddy really did. Teddy didn't hate people, but [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3098.46s)]
*  he really, I would say loathed Carter. He just had, he had complete disdain for him. And I, [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3103.98s)]
*  and he then liked, he liked Reagan. And because I was more ideologically aligned at that point, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3110.06s)]
*  I was, I'd say to him, you know, why do you like Reagan? And he said, because [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3118.62s)]
*  even though I don't agree with anything he said, he was able to invigorate our country. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3123.7400000000002s)]
*  He was able to inspire people. He got people excited about his vision and proud to be Americans. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3128.14s)]
*  And that is one of the functions of a president. It's to explain to us why we should be proud of [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3136.46s)]
*  each other and why we're part of a community and why our country is great and, you know, what our [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3143.42s)]
*  future is going to look like and get us and, you know, inspire all of us with that vision. And [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3149.66s)]
*  that is what a real leader does. How in the world can you do that if you cannot give an interview [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3155.82s)]
*  to a, to a news organ, to a friendly news organ, to a friendly news, they can't even do a setup [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3163.5800000000004s)]
*  interview in 40 days. I saw the only interview she did that was unscripted was when she got off a [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3169.7400000000002s)]
*  plane, I think it was at Andrews Air Force Base. And, and so there was a reporter waiting there [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3177.98s)]
*  and that, you know, with one question, when are you going to do an interview? And she said, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3183.26s)]
*  I've told my team that to try to get one done before September, this was the 3rd of August. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3187.7400000000002s)]
*  And I'm doing, I'm doing, you know, seven or eight interviews a day. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3196.3s)]
*  Tells you a lot. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3200.3s)]
*  And I'm, but I'm, and I'm not, you know, blowing my own horn or anything. I'm just saying that's [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3201.1800000000003s)]
*  what you do if you're in public life. And what's the point of being in public life if you don't [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3206.0600000000004s)]
*  want to promote your vision? If you don't want to inspire people. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3210.46s)]
*  I mean, so it, I'm sure this is a sense of, but I can't help but notice that you ran for [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3216.38s)]
*  15 months with no Secret Service protection at all. You were denied that by the, by the [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3224.94s)]
*  ministry. Trump during the convention in Milwaukee last month noted that in public, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3228.7s)]
*  they immediately under pressure responded and gave you Secret Service. Yes. Now they've withdrawn [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3235.1s)]
*  it. You're without it again. Yeah. Is that true? Yes. Meanwhile, Tony Fauci has it. He's not a [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3239.66s)]
*  federal employee anymore. I think Mike Pompeo has Secret Service protection, former CIA director, [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3245.8199999999997s)]
*  but you don't. How, how is that? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3251.3399999999997s)]
*  I think the, you know, I'm technically still running for president. I'm running for president [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3257.02s)]
*  30 save 40 states. So, um, I'm not, you know, I did not, uh, I did not terminate my, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3263.58s)]
*  my campaign. Did you know this? No, I didn't. Yeah. So, you know, I'm running in the, I, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3272.62s)]
*  there's certain, there's 10 states where I heard president Trump and their battleground states. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3279.18s)]
*  Oh, I've taken my name off the ballot in those 10 states, but in the blue states, all blue states, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3284.78s)]
*  all red states, I'm on the ballot and I could technically win a contingency election if the [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3290.3s)]
*  other two vote, you know, and, and they, if the other two get 269 a piece and, um, and then [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3295.42s)]
*  Congress cannot work out a compromise, which is entirely possible. They have to go to the third [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3304.86s)]
*  vote getter, which would be me. And that's why I left my name on the ballot in those states. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3310.54s)]
*  And so, um, uh, you know, that's highly unlikely to happen, but it has happened twice before in [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3315.66s)]
*  American history. And actually in our polling now shows them at exactly 269 to 269. Oh, it is [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3325.5s)]
*  possible that it would happen in this. So, and so I, so the, and I, you know, we worked this out with [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3335.18s)]
*  the Trump campaign. They only want it off in 10 states because that's the states we heard them in [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3340.62s)]
*  the other states. People can vote for me. I'm re and I, and they're not going to hurt their candidate. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3345.18s)]
*  They can vote for me even if they like president vice president Harris and without hurting her. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3352.38s)]
*  And they can vote for me if they like president Trump without hurting him, because we already [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3358.22s)]
*  know what's going to happen in those states. Yes. So all the more reason that you should have what [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3362.7799999999997s)]
*  Tony Fauci has and what Mike Pompeo has and a lot of other, by the way, non-current federal [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3368.78s)]
*  employees have, which is government bodyguards, but withdrew them immediately from you. So what's [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3374.7000000000003s)]
*  the message of that? Well, the message I think is a bad message, which is that our, uh, our [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3379.5s)]
*  federal enforcement agencies have been weaponized against the American people. I mean, again, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3387.7400000000002s)]
*  politically weaponized politically, not against the American people, but politically. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3392.94s)]
*  When my father took office in the justice department and my father was appointed a [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3397.98s)]
*  US attorney general in 1961 by my uncle, his brother, and my father, the first week in office, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3403.98s)]
*  he had run my uncle's campaign. So he was a political guy. He called together all the division [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3410.62s)]
*  chairs, all the branch chiefs in the DOJ. And he made his into his big cavernous office. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3416.46s)]
*  And he said to them, we're going to make one rule here, which is there is no politics. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3424.06s)]
*  We never asked whether a potential defendant is a Democrat or Republican. The people of this [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3430.22s)]
*  country have to know that their enforcement institutions, the department of justice is, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3435.34s)]
*  are, are, are the justice is blind here. We are free of any kind of political prejudice or bias [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3440.7799999999997s)]
*  or favoritism. And they started putting in jail. He prosecuted my uncle on my mother's side, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3453.2599999999998s)]
*  for antitrust violation. He prosecuted friends of his friends of his father's and father did not [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3461.42s)]
*  want him to prosecute. And they just said, it doesn't matter. We've got it. We've got to apply [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3468.2999999999997s)]
*  it even handily because the American people need to understand that their institutions are, are, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3473.9s)]
*  are free. We need to respect them and know that they're not biased in one way. And we're losing [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3481.18s)]
*  that now in our country. And the Biden administration has really accelerated that the most, the most [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3485.8199999999997s)]
*  shocking thing to me and Democrats can't even hear this story because it touches so many sort [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3492.2999999999997s)]
*  of culture war buttons, but it's, it's a true story. People need to understand it and appreciate it. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3498.14s)]
*  In the 2020 election, when, when, when a hundred Biden's laptop a week before the, [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3506.1400000000003s)]
*  we only know this, this whole story recently because of the release of documents, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3517.0200000000004s)]
*  but the, when president Biden's, the hundred Biden's laptop suddenly became an issue about [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3524.5400000000004s)]
*  a week before the debate and Anthony Blinken, who is now the secretary of state and who was then the [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3531.82s)]
*  director of president Biden's campaign went to Gina Haspel, who is the head of this director, [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3540.94s)]
*  the CIA and said to her, we need help with this. She then got 51 CIA current and former CIA officers [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3548.3s)]
*  to sign a public letter, which they publish, I think in the New York times, but they published it [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3559.7400000000002s)]
*  somewhere that, that said that hundred Biden's laptop was a Russian hoax. That was part of a [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3564.1400000000003s)]
*  Russian disinformation effort to tamper with the, with the presidential election campaign. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3572.1400000000003s)]
*  So you had the CIA, which is forbidden by its charter from involving itself in any American [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3580.94s)]
*  politics. And you had 51 top officers, former and current, who now do a disinformation campaign [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3589.9s)]
*  against the American public to tamper with the election while accusing the Russians of tampering [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3599.26s)]
*  with the election. And then a week later, president Biden, when he's asked about his laptop [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3604.22s)]
*  on the debate, he says that has been debunked by the CIA, by the CIA officers. And that was the end [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3612.62s)]
*  of the issue because it was debunked. All the newspapers picked that up and it's highly likely [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3620.62s)]
*  that that had an impact on the election. So, you know, we, that was the entree of president Biden [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3627.1s)]
*  getting into office. And again, you know, Democrats who hear me say this story are going to say, oh, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3635.66s)]
*  he's just saying that because, you know, he's a Republican now, right? Which I'm not, but that's [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3643.2599999999998s)]
*  what they're going to say. But it's not that it's just that this was wrong. The big tech companies [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3647.8199999999997s)]
*  censor our content. I hate to tell you that it's still going on in 2024, but you know what they [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3653.66s)]
*  can't censor? Live events. And that's why we are hitting the road on a fall tour for the entire [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3658.2999999999997s)]
*  month of September, coast to coast. We will be in cities across the United States. We'll be in [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3664.94s)]

*  So the CA, I mean a lot of roads lead back unfortunately to our most powerful intelligence [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3712.54s)]
*  agency. If you were asked, would you run it? Would you become CA director if you were asked? [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3718.7s)]
*  I would never get, yes I would, but I would never get Senate confirmation. As you know, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3723.58s)]
*  the intelligence agency are protected by very, very powerful committees in the Senate and in the [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3731.1s)]
*  House that are all read into the project and the people who serve on those committees are [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3738.7s)]
*  people who wouldn't, you know, they would not, they're just safeguarding that [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3747.5s)]
*  directorship and I would be very, very dangerous for those committees. So I don't think that... [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3752.22s)]
*  And yet in his, you know, in your joint appearance on Friday, President Trump introduced you by saying [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3758.62s)]
*  that he plans to, if elected, establish a commission to declassify the remaining [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3765.98s)]
*  documents around your uncle's murder in 1963. Yeah. And I think everyone at this point knows [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3771.82s)]
*  the truth, which is the CIA is implicated in that. Those documents protect the CIA, maybe among others. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3777.1800000000003s)]
*  Well, whether they do or not, it's odd that they've not allowed them to be released. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3782.38s)]
*  What could possibly be the explanation? More than 60 years after my uncle's death, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3787.5s)]
*  almost 65 years, oh, 62 years after his death. And none of the people who were [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3790.86s)]
*  implicated in that crime are alive now. The last ones have died off in the last year or two. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3799.5s)]
*  And so it clearly is to protect the institution. And that's wrong. It is wrong. And it's wrong for [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3806.3s)]
*  a Democrat, it's wrong for a Republican. It's just interesting though that a bipartisan [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3815.42s)]
*  list of presidents, though these six decades have kept those files classified. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3819.5s)]
*  Well, you and I have both. I was astonished that Trump didn't declassify them because he promised [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3825.34s)]
*  to during the campaign. That was Mike Pompeo who did that. Yeah. And that I talked to President [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3830.86s)]
*  Trump for the first time about that this week. And he said that Mike Pompeo begged him to... [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3835.58s)]
*  And I don't think I'm telling tales out of school here. No, I think... [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3846.2999999999997s)]
*  He told the same thing to you. That's true. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3850.3799999999997s)]
*  But he said Mike Pompeo called him and said this wouldn't be a catastrophe to release these. You [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3853.58s)]
*  need to not do it. And that, you know... I want to say again, I think Mike Pompeo is a criminal. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3858.8599999999997s)]
*  So that's my view. He threatened to sue me for saying that, but I hope he will because that's [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3864.06s)]
*  true. But that kind of tells the whole story right there, right? That the CIA is... [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3868.06s)]
*  Why would the CIA be trying to keep these files classified if they had nothing to do with the [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3874.78s)]
*  murder? I don't really get that. Yeah. The subject we were talking about was the [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3879.1800000000003s)]
*  weaponization of the federal agency. And that's just one of them. And then they get, you know, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3883.26s)]
*  then they open up these censorship portals, the 37 hours after President Biden takes office, [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3889.6600000000003s)]
*  where now you have the FBI involved in American politics, which we ran them out in the 60s, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3895.5800000000004s)]
*  because we were outraged that they were even... They were bugging Martin Luther King and the [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3902.22s)]
*  Black Panther Party. And Americans were indignant about that. Why are they think this... I mean, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3907.42s)]
*  why have we gotten to the point where it's so normalized and now we're okay with the FBI [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3913.74s)]
*  running a portal to censor political speech in our country and then inviting in the CIA and the [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3920.8599999999997s)]
*  IRS? I don't know what they were doing in there. And NIH and CDC and all these other agencies, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3927.5s)]
*  DHS, which all had a hand in censoring American speech. So that was another thing. And then [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3935.34s)]
*  the use, you know, which we saw for the first time in American history of the judiciary to [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3943.1s)]
*  do... To get rid of candidates, you know, what they tried to do to me, they're suing me now in [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3950.94s)]
*  a dozen states. I've been in trials for the past three weeks. You know, I've spent most of my time [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3957.58s)]
*  not campaigning, but being a sitting in court in cases that are trying to get me off the ballot. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3963.7400000000002s)]
*  So like, I had a million people, million American citizens sign petitions more than any candidate [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3971.1s)]
*  in history. Everybody said, I'd never do this. The impossible would be in the ballot in 50 states. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3979.9s)]
*  Well, guess what? We got on the ballot in 50 states. And we did it by getting a million citizens [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3984.78s)]
*  to sign petitions saying that they wanted to vote for me. And the Democratic Party now is suing me [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3992.46s)]
*  in all those states to make sure that those people cannot vote for the person they want to. When I [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=3998.46s)]
*  was growing up, the Democratic Party of RFK and JFK was the party that was fighting for voting [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4003.2599999999998s)]
*  rights. It was fighting to make sure that every American could vote for the candidate of their [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4011.2599999999998s)]
*  choice, no matter whether they're black or white or where they lived or Democrat or Republican. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4016.54s)]
*  Now the Democratic Party, today's Democratic Party, feels so [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4020.46s)]
*  unconfident about the candidates that it's putting forward. And it feels the only way it can win the [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4025.8199999999997s)]
*  election is by getting rid of the opponents and either using the courts against President Trump [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4031.5s)]
*  to lock him in jail and to embarrass and humiliate and discredit him, or using the courts against me [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4038.62s)]
*  to just to throw me off the ballot, even though the voters in New York's aid, I had to get 45,000 [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4047.18s)]
*  ballot signatures in 13 congressional districts. I got 137,000 in all 26 congressional districts. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4056.14s)]
*  I did twice when anybody wants and we did it easily because people wanted to see money on ballot, [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4069.18s)]
*  New Yorkers wanted to see me on the ballot. Why is the Democratic Party suing me in frivolous [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4073.74s)]
*  cases? I spent a whole week in a trial for that case, for two cases they brought, and another week [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4079.74s)]
*  in another trial for another case. Are you to pay for this? It's causing me 10 million dollars [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4087.2599999999998s)]
*  to defend myself. But on what grounds are they suing you? Like you don't have, they don't like [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4093.2599999999998s)]
*  you, so you don't have a right to be on the ballot? Or what? In New York's aid, they're suing me [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4097.179999999999s)]
*  by, they can't challenge our signatures because we got five times as many signatures as we required. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4103.580000000001s)]
*  So you know normally what they were doing in the first stage, they're taking our signatures and [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4110.540000000001s)]
*  they were calling everybody. They can get their numbers and they can get their you know cell phones [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4115.660000000001s)]
*  etc. We're contacting everybody who's signi- and trying to talk them out of it, trying to say, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4121.1s)]
*  you're hurting democracy and you know you should, you know weren't you fooled when you did this to [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4127.82s)]
*  try to get it? They never succeeded. In New York state, they're suing me because they say that I [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4134.0599999999995s)]
*  don't live in New York state. So I have three residences, one is in New York, one is in my home [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4144.38s)]
*  in Massachusetts, which you know is part of my family compound that we've owned for you know [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4152.3s)]
*  100 years. And then in California where I live with Cheryl, so I moved with Cheryl in California [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4158.7s)]
*  in 2014, so 10 years ago. I lived in New York all my life. I lived there since I was 10. My father [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4168.62s)]
*  ran for Senate there and was the Senator. I moved there when I was 10. I've only voted in New York. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4176.7s)]
*  I've always considered myself a New York resident. I've lived in the same town [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4183.66s)]
*  for 40 years in Bedford. I've lived in 13 different residents in that town at various times. And but I [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4188.78s)]
*  always wanted to stay there and when I moved out west with Cheryl, I made an agreement with her [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4195.66s)]
*  that you know when she retires we're going to come back to New York because I feel like I'm a New Yorker. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4202.3s)]
*  I didn't want to vote in California because I don't know anything about the politics out there. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4206.9400000000005s)]
*  I was raised in New York. I know all the politics, all the politicians, and so I wanted to vote. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4212.14s)]
*  So I kept an address there. I voted that address. That's my only place I've ever voted. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4219.1s)]
*  My car is registered there. My driver's license is there. My law office is there. I pay [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4225.02s)]
*  income tax almost all my income taxes from New York State. My law license is there. I don't have [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4233.26s)]
*  a law license in California. And my hunting license is there. My fishing license is there. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4239.900000000001s)]
*  Most importantly. My falconry license is there. So I have all my birds there. You know I keep them there. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4246.22s)]
*  And so you know but they're suing me saying I'm not a real New Yorker. I'm you know I contrive the [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4252.860000000001s)]
*  address out of fraud and it's a sham. And here's the thing is that I consulted a lawyer when I [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4259.42s)]
*  when we declared independent and began getting ballot signatures. I consulted the best [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4267.820000000001s)]
*  ballot access attorney in the country Paul Rossi. And I said I get these three different [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4272.14s)]
*  residences. Which one do I put on the ballot? You have to put the same residence in all 50 states. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4277.42s)]
*  You can't choose another resident. You know you can't I can't put California in one state and [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4284.7s)]
*  Massachusetts another state in New York. I have to tell the people otherwise I'm lying to somebody. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4289.66s)]
*  Right. So in a couple of states for example Maine where we are right now and in New Hampshire those [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4294.54s)]
*  states say the only place you can put down is your domicile is the place where you vote. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4303.5s)]
*  And in New Hampshire I actually had to take an oath in front of a notary [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4309.58s)]
*  that I voted in New York because otherwise I couldn't put it down. So I had to put New York [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4315.58s)]
*  in every state because I had to put it in Maine and New Hampshire and a bunch of others because [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4322.06s)]
*  you have to put the place you vote. Anyway the DNC is suing me saying I defrauded the public [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4325.82s)]
*  because I really live in California and they got a you know they got a judge who was [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4331.74s)]
*  you know right out of the democratic machine and who violated the constitution and every precedent [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4336.86s)]
*  to say yeah they're right. So you know I lost in the lower court which is what happens we're [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4345.5s)]
*  doing that we're losing in these lower courts and then we went in the appeals there's a hundred [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4350.0599999999995s)]
*  percent chance I'll win in the appeal but they don't care because it's going to take me a while [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4353.58s)]
*  and they got the headline saying he was thrown off for fraud. So these I mean I saw Kamala Harris [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4358.54s)]
*  just the other night at her convention speech talk about how voting access is like a I know [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4364.22s)]
*  while she was doing that I was in court in New York you know trying to get on a ballot while [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4369.98s)]
*  she while that you know the entire the John Lewis voting access act we're going to get through [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4376.86s)]
*  everybody has a right to vote yeah it's not except for their opponents. So does this it feels to me [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4383.5s)]
*  like this is you know obviously it's a big political story you're endorsing Trump it's a big [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4389.9s)]
*  big change in your life as a lifelong Democrat still a Democrat but it also feels like as you [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4395.5s)]
*  said at the outset. Well I'm an independent out so I registered as an independent when I ran and when [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4402.06s)]
*  I talked with President Trump the you know the thing that we talked about is that I you know that [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4407.66s)]
*  we were going to do a unity government with the independent not the kind of endorsements that a [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4414.78s)]
*  lot of people make an endorsement like Abraham Lincoln's team of rivals where we would be able [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4422.54s)]
*  to continue to differ publicly on issues but that we would on the issues that we agree on [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4430.54s)]
*  that we were going to strive to get into government together in order to make sure that those issues [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4438.139999999999s)]
*  are you know are you know are the priority for our country and you know he was really good about [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4443.66s)]
*  that and about you know me being able to continue on there's some issues there's a lot of issues [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4450.0599999999995s)]
*  like the border where we agree and you know censorship the wars the neocons that you know [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4454.94s)]
*  forever wars a child health epidemics those are the most important issues there's other issues [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4460.78s)]
*  that I'm going to disagree on with President Trump but he was happy with that and that's how [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4467.900000000001s)]
*  our country ought to be we ought to be able to. So what is this realignment that you mentioned at [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4471.9800000000005s)]
*  the outset because this does feel like it's bigger than just this November. Yeah I mean there's been a [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4476.46s)]
*  series of these realignments throughout American history and you know there there's history books [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4483.26s)]
*  that are written about you know the realignments that are about I think there's about five of them [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4489.820000000001s)]
*  and and then one of those is clearly happening now because you you see on so many issues you know [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4495.34s)]
*  that you've had an inversion the the Democratic Party has become the party of the elites [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4504.3s)]
*  it used to be the party of the poor and the working class in fact there was a study that came out just [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4510.9400000000005s)]
*  recently that I saw that showed that 70 percent that the people who voted for Biden own 70 percent [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4516.22s)]
*  of the wealth in this country the people who voted for Trump own 30 percent and and so I believe that [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4524.3s)]
*  right so you're seeing this realignment happen where the elites you know we're Wall Street or [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4531.9800000000005s)]
*  the big tech big pharma the big banking houses are all now Democratic and that the and that the [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4537.02s)]
*  working class the middle class the cops the firefighters Sean O'Brien out of the team [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4546.620000000001s)]
*  searching you know the spokes had a great guy great great guy really love him but he spoke [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4552.14s)]
*  at the Democratic convention I mean the Republican convention rather than Democratic convention so [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4560.46s)]
*  you're seeing this just this big alignment and even on environmental issues it's so weird to me [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4566.3s)]
*  because the Democrats have become subsumed in this carbon orthodox and you and I have talked about [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4572.38s)]
*  this that the only issue is carbon and what that's done is it's forced them to do something that you [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4578.78s)]
*  should never do if you're an environmentalist which is to commoditize and quantify everything [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4585.98s)]
*  so everything is measured by its carbon footprint how many tons of carbon it produces and [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4591.66s)]
*  you know you're basically you're you're putting everything in that kind of [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4597.18s)]
*  box of being able to quantify it and explain its value by you know by a numerically [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4603.58s)]
*  and the reason that we protect the environment is just the opposite of that the reason that we [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4611.18s)]
*  protect the environment is because there's a spiritual connection there's a you know there's [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4615.34s)]
*  a love that we have we you know I got in the environment because I wanted you know this [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4621.1s)]
*  connection to the fishes and the birds and the wildlife and the whales and the purple [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4627.820000000001s)]
*  mountains majesty and that you know I understood that the way you know God talks to human beings [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4635.9800000000005s)]
*  through many vectors through each other through organized religion through the great prophets [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4641.660000000001s)]
*  through the wise people the great books of those religions but nowhere with the kind of detail and [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4646.14s)]
*  texture and grace and joy as through creation and when we destroy nature we diminish our capacity [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4653.26s)]
*  to sense the divine understand who God is and what our own potential is and duties are as human beings [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4661.02s)]
*  and that I hope what you just said by the way is chopped up and put all over every social media [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4668.46s)]
*  platform in the world when we destroy nature we degrade our own ability to experience the divine [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4674.06s)]
*  yeah and that that you know it's not about quantifying stuff that's what the devil does [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4680.22s)]
*  he quantifies everything right and that is you know what he wants us doing put a number on it [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4685.9800000000005s)]
*  and the reason we're preserving these things is not is because we love our children you know and [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4692.700000000001s)]
*  it's because we we get nature enriches us enriches us economically and spiritually and [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4699.18s)]
*  culturally and historically it connects us to those 10 000 generations of human beings that were [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4705.58s)]
*  here before there were laptops and it you know and it connects us to the the most important [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4711.58s)]
*  spiritual lesson every every all of the organized religions in you know that that we know of today [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4718.22s)]
*  the central revelation of every one of those religions always occurred in the wilderness [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O-ZM0RxG4g&t=4728.62s)]
