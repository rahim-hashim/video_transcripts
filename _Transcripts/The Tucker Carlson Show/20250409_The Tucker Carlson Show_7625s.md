**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E)
*  Okay, so I want to impose my theory on you and you tell me what you think. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=0.0s)]
*  So for the past 15 years, I've been watching the feds, the FBI, the DOJ try to destroy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5.2s)]
*  you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  And I've watched as no group of gatekeepers or whistleblower protectors or journalistic [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=12.72s)]
*  ethics guardians have defended you on First Amendment grounds, which is pretty shocking. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=21.84s)]
*  But the question has always been, why are the feds so intent on taking you out? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=27.12s)]
*  And here's my theory. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  So the summer of 2001, you go on TV, time stamped and say, someone's going to fly planes [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=34.56s)]
*  to the World Trade Centers, they're going to blame Osama Bin Laden, call the Bush White [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=41.88s)]
*  House, warn them. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=45.52s)]
*  You basically called 911 in detail. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=46.82s)]
*  You're the only one who did. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  And we can prove that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=50.16s)]
*  It's not a guess. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=51.16s)]
*  We have the tape. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=52.28s)]
*  I've played the tape. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=53.28s)]
*  911 happens in September, there's a 911 commission immediately impaneled. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=54.72s)]
*  They go and interview a bunch of people in the US government and outside and ask like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=58.44s)]
*  where their signs of this was happening. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=61.92s)]
*  They don't interview you. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=63.08s)]
*  You're the one guy who predicted it in public or the only guy predicted in public and no [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=64.84s)]
*  one calls you to ask how the hell did you know that, which is the obvious question. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=68.12s)]
*  Then they set about trying to destroy you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=73.88s)]
*  Rather than like hailing you as a prophet or at least asking the question, how the hell [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=76.6s)]
*  did Alex Jones know in detail this was coming? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=80.3s)]
*  How did you know? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=82.76s)]
*  That's the question I ask you. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=83.76s)]
*  And then they mobilize DOJ and FBI against you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  I think there's a connection between those two facts. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, there certainly is. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=92.16s)]
*  I'd already been researching false flag attacks, not just by our government, but other governments [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  throughout history, the Gulf of Tonkin to get us into Vietnam in 64 that was later [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=118.24s)]
*  declassified to have been staged. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  And of course, the USS Liberty between Israel and the Lyndon Baines Johnson administration [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=124.72s)]
*  wanted to get us into full war with Egypt, but the ship survived, became the most decorated [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=131.28s)]
*  ship in US history because of the valiance of the crew. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=134.95999999999998s)]
*  And Operation Ajax where the CIA and Kermit Roosevelt in 53 overthrew Mohammed Mosaddegh, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=139.12s)]
*  who was a reformist and really pro-west, but he wouldn't give them all the oil. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=143.76s)]
*  They used radical Islamists to overthrow him and then put the Shah in and then overthrew [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=148.6s)]
*  the Shah. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=150.95999999999998s)]
*  Over and over again, there's just hundreds and hundreds of historical real case examples [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=152.04s)]
*  of that being done by our government and other governments. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  And I saw a lot of pre-programming in the news. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=160.83999999999997s)]
*  Oh, someone bin Laden is going to get us when he gets us. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  We need to give up all of our rights and we'll be a new America and we've got to set up [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  this police state. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=170.44s)]
*  So I saw a lot of pre-programming. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=171.44s)]
*  But you called the specifics. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  You called the specifics of 9-11. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=177.56s)]
*  I just can't get past that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  And I've asked you in public and private, how did you do that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=180.24s)]
*  I've never gotten really a straight answer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  I doubt I will now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=184.56s)]
*  But the fact remains the incontrovertible fact, the provable fact that you called it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=185.72s)]
*  And then they began a campaign against you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=191.12s)]
*  And it's not because you're a racist. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=193.44s)]
*  You've never been a racist or an anti-Semite or a crazy person. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=194.76000000000002s)]
*  Actually, you've never spewed hate, but you have for 30 years said the foundations of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  our system are actually kind of fake and rotten. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  But it was 9-11. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=208.48000000000002s)]
*  That's when they really decided this guy has to be stopped and just basically eliminated [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=210.60000000000002s)]
*  the First Amendment to stop you. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=215.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, just to be clear, it's not that I'm dodging how I knew it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=216.36s)]
*  That was 24 years ago. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=220.04000000000002s)]
*  And I remember what I was covering and what I was doing at the time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=222.44s)]
*  And everybody's seen the July 25th where I went into detail. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=227.0s)]
*  But actually, my crew using chat GPT scanning through all my old shows found shows in April [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=230.92s)]
*  and even before that in March where I get more specific. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  And I said the CIA is going to fly planes into the World Trade Centers and blame it [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=239.2s)]
*  on Bin Laden. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=244.48s)]
*  So I just think that's the most amazing fact I've ever heard in my entire life that you [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=245.48s)]
*  call that. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=249.6s)]
*  And again, we can prove it because it's on tape with timestamps. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=250.6s)]
*  And everyone's like, Oh, yeah, okay, Alex Jones is crazy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  Okay, whatever. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=256.96s)]
*  I don't think that's true. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=258.0s)]
*  But you called 911 and no investigator ever called you to ask you how you called that? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=259.5s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no one from DOJ Philip Zelikow of the 911 Commission. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=265.52s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=270.52s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=271.52s)]
*  And, well, I mean, obviously, because certain segments of our intelligence agencies with [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=272.52s)]
*  other foreign intelligence agencies were tracking the supposed hijackers. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=278.0s)]
*  They were being trained US military bases. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  They were being given government money from our government and other governments. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=284.14s)]
*  They were being protected. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=287.88s)]
*  Then two of their magic passports and all that rubble and hundreds of millions of pieces [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=288.88s)]
*  of paper were found the next day to then connect them to it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=292.4s)]
*  It was all laid out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=299.04s)]
*  Then the Bin Laden family was thrown out, was flown out of the country in the days after [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=300.04s)]
*  and that was basically shut down in the news. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=304.92s)]
*  You know, it was covered some locally here in Florida. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=306.56s)]
*  So I knew that Bin Laden had been CIA going back to really the majordi being set up by [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=309.36s)]
*  Bingham Brzezinski and Jimmy Carter. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=315.76s)]
*  Then Reagan took that over and then they kind of build that as blowback. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=317.04s)]
*  But even recently, you've seen the USAID information and other documents come out in the Institute [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=320.84s)]
*  for Peace where they're directly paying massive amounts of money to Taliban, to Al Qaeda, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=325.4s)]
*  to ISIS even in the last few years. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=331.24s)]
*  And they use them as these proxy armies. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=334.12s)]
*  So that was well known in the research circles that Bin Laden was basically a multinational [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=335.64s)]
*  cutout used by Western intelligence agencies to destabilize areas, but also be a boogeyman. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=342.16s)]
*  Then you see CNN in a mountain cave, magically being able to find him, but the US can't kill [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=346.72s)]
*  him and nobody else can. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=351.76000000000005s)]
*  And I knew that CNN is literally the CIA broadcasting system. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=353.24s)]
*  For sure. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=357.20000000000005s)]
*  Total Mockingbird thoroughbred. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  And there were hundreds and hundreds of points that went in, but okay, Bin Laden's work for [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=360.32000000000005s)]
*  the CIA and you got CNN interviewing him and they're all scaring us saying he's about to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  attack us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=369.12s)]
*  And then I remembered how Ahmad Salam, who was an Egyptian intelligence agency operative [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=370.2s)]
*  working for the FBI and CIA, was hired to build a bomb in the early 90s to blow up the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=376.2s)]
*  World Trade Center. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=382.24s)]
*  But then when they said build a real bomb, he started recording them because he sort [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=383.52s)]
*  of figured out it was a setup. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=386.8s)]
*  And then he had that press conference where he played it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=387.8s)]
*  I interviewed him a few times where the FBI said, no, just go ahead and let it go forward. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=389.8s)]
*  And so you start adding all that together. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=395.16s)]
*  They'd already tried to hit the World Trade Center before. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=397.44s)]
*  The World Trade Center had a lot of issues in it with asbestos and also some of the structural [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=400.68s)]
*  issues. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=405.32s)]
*  So they were already wanting to have a plan to get rid of it. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=406.32s)]
*  And then you have the CIA and FBI in the Solomon Brothers building, Building 7, the 47 story [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=408.84s)]
*  skyscraper. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=415.92s)]
*  You have that right next door. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=417.6s)]
*  So I looked at all of it and I thought, where would the new Pearl Harbor be? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=419.44s)]
*  The year before in the Project for American Century, headed up by Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=423.8s)]
*  Dick Cheney wrote in there that we need a new Pearl Harbor event to launch the Pax Americana. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  But it wasn't an American empire of freedom and liberty and justice like Trump's trying [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=434.32000000000005s)]
*  to launch. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  It was a globalist empire of military enforcement and tyranny. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=439.3s)]
*  And so there was a lot of other data points that went into it. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=442.64000000000004s)]
*  Cheney also writes in that same document, we need to look at race specific bio weapons [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=447.16s)]
*  to have control and bring in our power. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=451.88s)]
*  And that was actually picked up in the newspapers. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=453.72s)]
*  Okay, so these are not minor issues. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=455.32s)]
*  This is like the biggest things happening in the world. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=458.04s)]
*  The most important things happening in the world. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=461.0s)]
*  And the end of one system ushering in a new system, millions in the end died because of [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=463.88s)]
*  all of this, millions. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=468.18s)]
*  And you're on like cable access in Texas, figuring this out. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=470.36s)]
*  Where is everybody else? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=475.36s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=476.84000000000003s)]
*  I worked at CNN at the time. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=478.68s)]
*  We had, as you said, Peter Bergen went and interviewed. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=481.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm not attacking Peter Bergen. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=484.35999999999996s)]
*  But like, how come you were the only one who figured this out? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=486.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, by that time I started out in 94 as a guest on access TV and had my own show by [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=490.59999999999997s)]
*  95. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  But I was on local talk radio. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  I just started getting, I've been syndicated a few years then. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  But I was okay. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=500.23999999999995s)]
*  I was on access TV as well. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=501.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's where the way out on the fringe. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=503.0s)]
*  And all the people at the very center of our business, journalism, like they didn't see [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=507.32s)]
*  or didn't talk publicly about any of this. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=513.24s)]
*  Like none of this. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=516.2s)]
*  Well I saw Gary Hart on with another guest. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=517.48s)]
*  Gary Hart, the former presidential candidate, Senator from Colorado? [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=521.8s)]
*  Yes, I think it was the Hart-Rebman Commission. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=524.2s)]
*  I saw him in Congress with testimony earlier that year and also saw him on, I believe it [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=526.8s)]
*  was CNN or maybe it was Chris Matthews, MSNBC. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=535.5999999999999s)]
*  But the clip's famous. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=539.76s)]
*  And they say the world's about to change. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=541.92s)]
*  There's about to be big things happening, big, big attacks. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=543.28s)]
*  When was this? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=546.2399999999999s)]
*  It was in early July. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=547.2399999999999s)]
*  Oh, it was before 9-11. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=550.92s)]
*  And they were very specific. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=551.92s)]
*  Somebody should find that clip, can crowdsource that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=553.3599999999999s)]
*  And that was the final catalyst because they were basically telling the establishment very [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  thinly veiled what was about to go on. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=561.5999999999999s)]
*  So I sat back, I looked at it and I thought years later, how did I come up with that? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=563.72s)]
*  So I don't just say a bunch of stuff that most of it doesn't come true. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=568.0s)]
*  I'm very specific on predictions and almost all of them have come true. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=570.36s)]
*  I thought that it was the spinoff of the X-Files. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=573.48s)]
*  I wasn't even an X-Files fan, rarely watched it. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=576.0400000000001s)]
*  Called the lone gunman that it turns out had come out in the spring of 2001 that I didn't [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=579.6s)]
*  even learn about because there wasn't Facebook and Twitter and X back then. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=588.36s)]
*  So if you didn't watch those entertainment shows, you didn't know about it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=593.3s)]
*  And then six months or so after 9-11, listeners start saying, have you seen this? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=596.3s)]
*  And I had listeners send me VHS recordings off Fox TV of this episode where a criminal [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=601.06s)]
*  group in the US government hijacks a jumbo jet in New York to fly it in the World Trade [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=607.9s)]
*  Center to blame it on a Central Asian terrorist so that they have a pretext to take it over [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=612.78s)]
*  domestic with the police state and launch wars in the Middle East. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=619.86s)]
*  This was on the X-Files? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  Yes, this was on the X-Files. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=625.1800000000001s)]
*  And so later I thought maybe I got it from that. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=626.1800000000001s)]
*  But then we found tapes even earlier a month before that came out where I was already had [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=629.82s)]
*  put it together on the radio. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=633.72s)]
*  But here's what's crazy. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=635.32s)]
*  Then I got reached out by some of the hosts of the X-Files saying, hey, Chris Carter told [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=636.98s)]
*  us that the CIA came to him with the plot of this and asked him some of the scripts [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=642.6s)]
*  They would ask him as a favor to put this in as a TV program. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=647.06s)]
*  And then later I corresponded to Chris Carter via email. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=651.18s)]
*  He talked about this in the news, like in entertainment publications about Alex Jones [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=653.3399999999999s)]
*  really good guy. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=659.1s)]
*  And when they rebooted in 2016 again, he talked about the talk show host characters based [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=660.1s)]
*  on me. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=664.0799999999999s)]
*  So I've talked to him, some of his crew, but he said, no, I don't know why the CIA used [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=665.0799999999999s)]
*  to interview him, came to me and said, here's the script for this show. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=668.86s)]
*  So it wasn't just Alex Jones saying that a government agency was going to hijack a jet [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=672.86s)]
*  and fly the World Trade Center. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=677.18s)]
*  The X-Files spin-off, The Lone Gunman, one of its main episodes was about that specific [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=678.66s)]
*  story. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=686.3s)]
*  This is just crazy. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=687.3s)]
*  So I often get people I know saying- [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=688.3s)]
*  Oh, and they remote control and hijack the jet, the good guys, and keep it from crashing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=689.98s)]
*  the World Trade Center. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=693.3399999999999s)]
*  So why would the CIA come to Chris Carter and say, we want you to write this? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=696.42s)]
*  And then it's released months and months before 9-11. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=700.14s)]
*  So I'm not the only one. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=702.82s)]
*  It was in the collective unconsciousness. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=704.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=707.78s)]
*  But I said two weeks before they shot Trump in Butler, I went on air and I said, they're [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=709.78s)]
*  going to try to shoot him at a rally. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=714.86s)]
*  That's obvious to see how desperate they were, how the law fair didn't work. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=717.94s)]
*  A lot of this is just studying how they operate. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=720.78s)]
*  But so much of it now is John Podesta in August 2020, the New York Times wrote about it, had [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=723.14s)]
*  a big war game with the top Democrats. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=729.78s)]
*  And they said if Trump wins, if they weren't able to steal it, in my view, then we're going [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=731.9s)]
*  to have civil war conditions, we're going to have blue states succeed, blue cities, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=736.5799999999999s)]
*  and we're going to use social issues to foment a rebellion that we're going to basically [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=739.9399999999999s)]
*  frame as racial, George Floyd on steroids, 10.0. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=743.8199999999999s)]
*  And then we're going to drive Trump from office. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=748.22s)]
*  Well, they were able to steal it, in my view, the evidence of things overwhelming. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=750.02s)]
*  So they didn't use that plan. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=753.78s)]
*  Well, they sort of talked about that plan again in the months before this last election [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=754.78s)]
*  last year. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=758.46s)]
*  So much of what I'm able to predict isn't really prediction. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=760.26s)]
*  They admit it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=765.1s)]
*  I mean, the UN said for 20 years, we're going to use disease acts to bring in a global system, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=766.1s)]
*  a global central bank digital currency, a global social credit score, a global vaccine [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=770.46s)]
*  ID that will be used as the global internet ID, global taxation ID. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=775.54s)]
*  That's official Bill Gates, the UN, all these big bodies preparing how they'd roll this [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=780.22s)]
*  out. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=784.46s)]
*  You have the Rockefeller Foundation with Operation Lockstep 2010, 2011, describing locking down [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=785.46s)]
*  the sports stadiums, locking in your houses six feet apart, wearing masks for fear. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=789.94s)]
*  I mean, that's then Bush, George W. had that in the BioShield program that passed in 2005, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=793.7800000000001s)]
*  where they sent out kits, millions of them to everybody and to the Red Cross with the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=799.9000000000001s)]
*  six feet apart, with the mask, with all the stuff. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=803.3800000000001s)]
*  But they didn't launch the bio attacks scare that they had, I think, locked and loaded. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=805.34s)]
*  Then they waited till 2020. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=810.82s)]
*  So basically, you're just taking them at their word. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=813.0600000000001s)]
*  You're doing what I don't do enough, which is listen to people I disagree with and sincerely [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=816.9799999999999s)]
*  try to assess what they're saying. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=823.0999999999999s)]
*  Fauci just said last week, a much worse, way higher morbidity. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=824.66s)]
*  It's respiratory, it's coming. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=829.62s)]
*  And you got Hotez, oh, don't worry, Trump's going to have a big problem. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=831.18s)]
*  It's going to come crashing in on him. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=834.6999999999999s)]
*  We'll see how he tries to reboot the economy. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=836.38s)]
*  And then you know, then you learn Fauci and all of them are involved with Obama and Chapel [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=838.9799999999999s)]
*  Hill in North Carolina creating COVID-19. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=842.98s)]
*  It was a big scandal 2015, gain of function, SARS. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=846.3800000000001s)]
*  And then they move it to a plausible deniability so they can kind of blame the Chinese that [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=850.2600000000001s)]
*  they want. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=854.86s)]
*  I'm not saying the Chinese are good, the Chinese are terrible. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=855.86s)]
*  It was kind of a joint project. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=857.82s)]
*  And then then they roll it out. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=859.4200000000001s)]
*  Then they've got their so-called shot. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=861.86s)]
*  That's mRNA. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=863.1s)]
*  I mean, this stuff is all very well planned. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=864.1s)]
*  And so when you see him up there lying, going, no, Senator Paul, it is you that is wrong, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=865.9000000000001s)]
*  no gain of function. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=870.7800000000001s)]
*  Then it's in all his emails. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=872.0999999999999s)]
*  This is gain of function. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=873.3399999999999s)]
*  And he has public symposiums in defense of gain of function. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=874.5s)]
*  And I mean, he's Mr. Gain of Function. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=878.06s)]
*  If he was a superhero, he would just have gain of function on his chest and the back [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=879.5s)]
*  of his cape. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=883.2199999999999s)]
*  And he's like, I don't know anything about that. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=883.9399999999999s)]
*  And so, I mean, these guys just treat us like children. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=885.9799999999999s)]
*  And so they kept saying we're going to use a virus, we're going to use a scare to bring [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=889.9799999999999s)]
*  in our global government. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=892.8599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I remember Lou Dobbs in Judicial Watch 2006 sued to get North American Union [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=894.02s)]
*  documents. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=900.3399999999999s)]
*  And in it, they're meeting up in Banff, Canada, and they're like, we're going to use [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=901.3s)]
*  collapsing migration flow from a virus to flood the West and use that crisis to bring [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=904.42s)]
*  a new Marshall Plan. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=909.7s)]
*  We're going to use a disease X to finally get the world to accept this global government. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=910.9s)]
*  So they're just scheming constantly. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=915.9s)]
*  They have Event 201. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=917.78s)]
*  But in public. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=918.86s)]
*  In public. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=919.98s)]
*  They have the Spars War Game 2025, 2028 that came out of FUERS before 2020 and the viral [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=920.86s)]
*  release that is actually set in 2020 to 2024. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=926.38s)]
*  And it rolls out how they're all going to do it. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=930.26s)]
*  The tweets that are in there are almost word for they just changed the name Spars to COVID-19. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=932.82s)]
*  So it's a blueprint. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=940.82s)]
*  And then they get caught. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=942.1s)]
*  Oh, it's not a viral attack plan. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=943.22s)]
*  Oh, it's just a war game. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=945.42s)]
*  But the war game matches the exact rollout of the attacks. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=946.9399999999999s)]
*  They're all in script. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=949.74s)]
*  So in a normal world that rewarded excellence and prescience, you'd be a billionaire because [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=950.5799999999999s)]
*  of your predictive powers. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean, huge companies, governments hire people who can piece together fragments of evidence [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=958.06s)]
*  to create an accurate picture of the future. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=964.0999999999999s)]
*  That's a huge business. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=965.8199999999999s)]
*  I know a lot of people in that business, George Friedman, guys like that, really, really smart [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=967.14s)]
*  people. But you've got the best track record of all. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=970.62s)]
*  And I think it's so telling that rather than reward you for this or call you up and be [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=974.9399999999999s)]
*  like, Alex Jones, what do you think's coming next? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=981.02s)]
*  They're like, no, we must eliminate our own First Amendment to destroy your life, which [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=983.14s)]
*  is what they've done. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=988.38s)]
*  That seems like a pretty clear indicator of their guilt to me. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=990.54s)]
*  Well, what they don't want is compartmentalized good people in industry and government, not [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=994.18s)]
*  just here around the world, to listen to what I'm saying, go check it out for themselves, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=998.5s)]
*  find out everything I just said is on record. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1001.9399999999999s)]
*  Everybody can just type in anything I said. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1003.5s)]
*  And it's from their own documents. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1004.7s)]
*  And then people will basically put the glasses on like they live and see it for themselves. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1006.74s)]
*  I'm not telling them what to see like the corporate media does, brainwashing people [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1011.5s)]
*  and selling them a lie that two men can have a baby and there's no extra chromosomes and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1014.78s)]
*  communism is great. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1018.74s)]
*  And open borders are wonderful. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1019.62s)]
*  No, I mean, I'm simply saying see this for yourself. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1021.98s)]
*  I liken it to those hidden image paintings. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1023.98s)]
*  And when you first can't see the hidden image, you're like, I can't see. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1027.02s)]
*  Once you do see it, you can't unsee it. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1029.58s)]
*  I'm only trying to get people to go look at what I'm pointing out and find out. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1031.8999999999999s)]
*  I liken this whole thing to like you have the adult table with the CFR, the Club of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1037.58s)]
*  Rome, the WUF and the UN, the think tanks, the RAND Corporation. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1041.4599999999998s)]
*  And they're at the adult table at Thanksgiving and the general public and even a lot of the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1045.1399999999999s)]
*  politicians are compartmentalized and naive. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1049.1s)]
*  We're over at the kids table. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1051.5s)]
*  And we'd actually listen to what the adult table because that's their arrogance. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1053.4599999999998s)]
*  They admit 99 percent of us in their own battle plans. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1057.58s)]
*  As if we are too lazy or stupid to ever go look at it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1062.02s)]
*  And that's part of a confidence game they have with their own people, their own [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1065.54s)]
*  corporate intelligence operatives, their own government intelligence operatives, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1068.78s)]
*  their own networks where they just basically admit all this stuff out in the open. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1072.3s)]
*  I mean, it's like, you know, mud from the CIA on CNN saying Foggy Bottom is going to [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1076.62s)]
*  kill this guy, we're going to kill Trump. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1082.1s)]
*  And then Trump had called me back in his first administration. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1084.3799999999999s)]
*  I said, listen, you need to watch out. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1088.1799999999998s)]
*  They've got Phil Mudd and all these other guys on CNN, MSNBC saying they're going to [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1090.54s)]
*  kill you. He goes, just a moment. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1095.46s)]
*  He goes, I'm going to have a Secret Service call you. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1097.7s)]
*  In about an hour, they call me. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1099.02s)]
*  Go, what's going on, Alex? [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1100.02s)]
*  Trump told us to call you. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1101.18s)]
*  And I said, you don't know about this, this, this, this, this, this. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1102.58s)]
*  So he goes, here's our email. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1104.94s)]
*  And I sent the Secret Service this as if the Secret Service doesn't know they were all [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1106.34s)]
*  over TV saying we're going to kill Trump. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1110.34s)]
*  So, so it's possible they caught that. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1113.1s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1115.06s)]
*  And then Trump didn't catch it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1116.94s)]
*  So, so, and I mean, now they're everywhere. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1118.22s)]
*  You've got this new Rutgers study out where 55 percent of Democrats, liberals are [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1121.1000000000001s)]
*  asking, do you support Trump being killed? [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1126.22s)]
*  They're like, yes, we want him dead. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1128.06s)]
*  We should be assassinating. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1129.34s)]
*  This is like this week and came out over the weekend. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1130.54s)]
*  And they asked him, so do you see yourself as part of a assassination culture? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1134.66s)]
*  And they said, yes. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1139.26s)]
*  So, but then if you say, oh, the Democrats are fomenting violence, I mean, the view [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1140.74s)]
*  says all the time he's killing people. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1145.18s)]
*  Elon's killing people. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1147.06s)]
*  They don't say how he's they're stealing your social security. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1148.06s)]
*  They're killing old ladies. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1150.74s)]
*  And so we need to be ready to fight and die to take this guy out. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1152.1s)]
*  Those are quotes. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1155.62s)]
*  And, and, and then they just sit back and go, oh, no, no, no, we're not calling for [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1157.3s)]
*  violence with Crockett and all of them. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1161.4199999999998s)]
*  But, but they're not going to do it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1163.5s)]
*  They want lone nuts to do it because their other windup operatives like Crooks and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1164.6599999999999s)]
*  the other guy are in Florida failed. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1169.5s)]
*  But I mean, they are, they are crazy. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1171.94s)]
*  And of the establishment or what's left of it's falling apart thinks killing Trump [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1174.22s)]
*  is going to help them. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1179.14s)]
*  They're delusional because if you look at all the scenarios that come out of that, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1180.98s)]
*  it's much worse for them. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1183.78s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1184.6200000000001s)]
*  I absolutely agree that not all sleep aids are made by pharmaceutical companies. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1185.14s)]
*  You probably heard about eight sleep by now. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1188.82s)]
*  They develop the country's most innovative products for sleep. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1190.98s)]
*  Almost everybody in our office uses something they make called the pod and they [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1194.54s)]
*  love it. And there's a reason that professional athletes and lots of other [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1198.3s)]

*  are burdened with and don't really want to be burdened with. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1289.18s)]
*  But like, how do you turn off the visions of the future in your head? [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1291.18s)]
*  Well, I mean, I appreciate you saying nice things about me. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1294.78s)]
*  And obviously, God gives us all different gifts and I do have some gifts. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1297.66s)]

*  But you can prove it. That's why I've obviously we're friends and I [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1305.34s)]

*  I've got the freaking tape. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1327.46s)]
*  So, again, it's not even a compliment. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1328.6999999999998s)]
*  It's just an observation. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1330.3s)]
*  And I don't know why I seem to be the only person who's obsessed with this. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1331.46s)]
*  Like, how did this guy predict this? [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1333.86s)]
*  No, everyone's like, oh, he's great. OK, maybe he's crazy, but he predicted this. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1335.74s)]
*  So my question is like, what does that do to you? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1339.06s)]
*  I mean, it is stressful, the responsibility of constantly [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1342.1s)]
*  researching and looking at all the culture. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1347.26s)]
*  Pop culture, that's where a lot of the real brainwashing is at. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1351.62s)]
*  That's where a lot of the predictive programming and manipulation goes on. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1354.06s)]
*  Yes. But also in so-called news. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1357.1799999999998s)]
*  But I mean, I did get to where I drank way too much, ate too much, got really unhealthy [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1359.8999999999999s)]
*  because I could go home at night and have some drinks and, you know, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1364.6599999999999s)]
*  eat half a kilo of pie and just kind of dial out and forget about reality. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1368.7s)]
*  But things have gotten so intense and so dangerous that for about the last nine months, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1374.26s)]
*  I haven't drank and I've been exercising every day and I've lost 63 pounds and I feel great. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1377.98s)]
*  And I've just embraced the responsibility. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1382.46s)]
*  Plus, we're alive right now, really in the great awakening, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1385.3s)]
*  where more and more people are piecing things together and deciding to really get [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1388.82s)]
*  informed and engaged. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1393.06s)]
*  And so I've always said I want to become obsolete, where people really start [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1395.06s)]
*  understanding how the world really works to such an extent that there are so many other [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1398.6599999999999s)]
*  journalists and researchers and pundits, just private citizens and people in business [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1402.1799999999998s)]
*  and academia and life and in the ecclesiastical circles, that they really [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1405.5s)]
*  realize that this globalist system is transhumanist. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1410.62s)]
*  It is evil. It is a spiritual battle at the end of the day. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1413.4199999999998s)]
*  And people need to really choose a side. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1416.1799999999998s)]
*  And so I think choosing the side and saying, hey, God, I can't do this. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1418.1s)]
*  You know, I'm weak, I'm imperfect, but through you, I can. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1424.06s)]
*  And really praying and asking God to lead God and direct you and give you discernment. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1426.86s)]
*  So to really answer your question, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1431.26s)]
*  I'll have all this data and this research. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1434.94s)]
*  And so so that my feeble human mind can understand really what God tells me. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1437.34s)]
*  And then it's that final little ingredient of being sure about something, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1442.74s)]
*  that that's what they're intending to do. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1446.7s)]
*  But we have real agency. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1448.86s)]
*  Good has more power than evil. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1451.42s)]
*  They always say the devil's greatest trick was convincing the world that he didn't exist. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1453.02s)]
*  I think that's the second biggest trick, is he doesn't exist. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1456.46s)]
*  And he does. His biggest trick is convincing people that there is no good out there [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1459.22s)]
*  and that and that and that there's not. That's right. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1463.86s)]
*  And and that God doesn't exist. So. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1466.26s)]
*  You know, for me, so much of it, again, is in the old days, the globalists, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1469.46s)]
*  the the Western propaganda after the end of World War Two. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1474.74s)]
*  And since then, when we won World War Two, had pretty much total narrative control. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1477.7s)]
*  And so anything they were pre-programming and preparing and hyping [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1483.02s)]
*  the people for, they pretty much always got what they wanted. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1487.18s)]
*  So it was easy to follow those trend lines out [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1490.7s)]
*  and see what the probable main scenarios were. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1493.3799999999999s)]
*  And then things would almost always come true that I predicted [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1496.86s)]
*  because they were still in charge. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1499.78s)]
*  Now that the globalists are really collapsing [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1501.3s)]
*  and a new international order and system is forming, coming from the grassroots up, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1504.7s)]
*  politics is downstream from the grassroots. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1509.26s)]
*  And because Trump is such a chaos bringer to their system, which is good, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1512.54s)]
*  but with it also comes danger. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1517.86s)]
*  But it's better than living, you know, you know, on our knees [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1520.14s)]
*  and then ending up having our souls basically taken. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1523.86s)]
*  It's it's it's it's better to fight down our feet. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1526.34s)]
*  But in my experience, people that fight on their feet live a lot longer [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1528.54s)]
*  and have better lives than people that try to live on their knees. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1531.82s)]
*  People live on their knees actually die on their knees a lot more often [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1534.18s)]
*  than people die on their feet, in my experience. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1537.22s)]
*  So now is really the global revolution. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1538.66s)]
*  It's a spiritual revolution. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1541.22s)]
*  The information, the culture, all of that comes out of that. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1542.74s)]
*  And so now there's so many possible futures and so many developments [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1545.98s)]
*  because there's been so many good people that actually care [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1550.58s)]
*  and want to stabilize civilization and thrive and have a future [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1553.58s)]
*  and who are not based on conquest mindsets, but are based on Renaissance concepts. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1557.18s)]
*  The great reset versus the great awakening that right now anything is possible [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1563.6200000000001s)]
*  because America still has the world reserve currency, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1569.02s)]
*  still has the biggest, best military, still has the best energy system [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1572.1000000000001s)]
*  for raw energy and still has a spirit that is being rekindled. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1575.46s)]
*  That was the apple of the world's eye and really the flower of the Renaissance [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1579.7s)]
*  that we're now rebooting. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1583.46s)]
*  It's powering back up right now. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1585.14s)]
*  And that window is closing, but we're we're acting on it right now. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1586.94s)]
*  And if we're just not weak and cowards, like Trump has said, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1592.18s)]
*  and if we don't become Panikans but remain Americans, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1596.74s)]
*  then really anything is possible because, as Elon has said, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1601.3000000000002s)]
*  if America falls the central pillar in Western civilization [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1606.26s)]
*  and Western civilization falls, it all falls. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1609.18s)]
*  Yes. And so for me, I don't do this out of courage. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1611.42s)]
*  I do it out of direct self-preservation for myself, my family, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1614.74s)]
*  and by extension, everybody else, because we're all interconnected. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1618.38s)]
*  And people need to understand the true urgency that the globalist [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1620.8600000000001s)]
*  said they were going to collapse the world economy and use that for social [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1624.7s)]
*  control, as Larry Fink said, to control our behavior. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1627.46s)]
*  And we're going to build something extremely hellscapish and dystopic [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1629.78s)]
*  in their own admissions. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1633.58s)]
*  All the horrible stuff we see is just the leading edge of it. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1635.14s)]
*  And so to me, there's really even no choice [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1639.46s)]
*  but to fight with everything I've got. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1643.02s)]
*  You said this is a you said two things that really struck me. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1645.34s)]
*  One, that anything is possible right now. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1649.46s)]
*  This could go in an infinite number of directions, some hellish and some blessed. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1652.5s)]
*  And so I think that that feels right to me. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1657.82s)]
*  Second, you said this is a spiritual revolution. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1660.4199999999998s)]
*  What are the signs that you see of that? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1662.8999999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1664.34s)]
*  Well, if you read the Bible, Old Testament, New Testament, it's all there. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1667.02s)]
*  And then I see it happening. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1669.7s)]
*  It says that during these big times of change, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1671.86s)]
*  that you'll see the best out of the good people and the worst out of the bad people. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1675.06s)]
*  And some people you thought were good are going to really activate [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1678.86s)]
*  show you their real cards, that they're really your servants of evil [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1681.58s)]
*  or really slaves of evil. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1684.86s)]
*  And then you're going to see some people you thought weren't good [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1686.6599999999999s)]
*  that are going to be touched and make the decision to be strong for liberty. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1689.34s)]
*  That'll be some of our greatest champions. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1692.58s)]
*  Yes. And that you're not going to really see people in the middle anymore. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1694.3s)]
*  That big middle of people passing the buck. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1698.1s)]
*  God said you were hot or cold. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1700.02s)]
*  You were lukewarm. I spit shot of my mouth. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1701.78s)]
*  And so we're going into really the beginning. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1703.78s)]
*  It's going to get way more intense, in my view. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1706.5s)]
*  I mean, of any prediction, it's that. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1709.1s)]
*  People think things are wild now and tumultuous. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1710.62s)]
*  It's this is going to be seen as the calm before the storm. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1712.9399999999998s)]
*  And so so there's going to be nowhere to be in the middle. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1716.58s)]
*  People are going to have to choose a side. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1719.58s)]
*  And those that have chosen evil, chosen the establishment, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1721.3s)]
*  chosen the satanic world order [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1723.86s)]
*  are are going to get deeper and deeper into their devotion and their hysteria, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1727.3s)]
*  their violence, trying to prop it up because deep down [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1731.62s)]
*  they're they're scared. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1736.1s)]
*  They have a form of Stockholm syndrome where they go to the abuser [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1737.74s)]
*  and think if they prostrate themselves before it, somehow they'll be given [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1741.42s)]
*  deliverance when really they just need to repent and ask God to come in [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1744.5800000000002s)]
*  to their heart and cleanse them and then rise them up [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1747.94s)]
*  to be a soldier against this evil in this key time. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1751.46s)]
*  But there'll be no room for anybody in the middle in the time we're in. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1753.74s)]
*  And I'm talking to so many people that weren't even Christian [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1758.22s)]
*  or religious or even spiritual who are saying it's good versus evil. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1760.74s)]
*  And I talked to so many people, I know they're professionals [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1764.82s)]
*  and they know Austin's full of a lot of, you know, particularly rich people [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1767.46s)]
*  and women, you know, just becoming demon possessed. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1772.1000000000001s)]
*  I mean, literally saying that they're demon possessed. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1775.58s)]
*  And I'm hearing about all over the country, all over the world. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1778.74s)]
*  What is that? It's so noticeable. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1781.58s)]
*  And I I'm so blessed to be surrounded by mostly by women [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1783.94s)]
*  who are just the opposite or wonderful, but I who are the rock. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1787.14s)]
*  I mean, they're just the best. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1790.66s)]
*  However, what you just described is just on display everywhere. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1791.66s)]
*  Well, and it's been to you about the soccer coach that just kidnapped [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1795.94s)]
*  the little kid and took him and killed him and threw him in the woods, reportedly. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1799.3400000000001s)]
*  Allegedly. I mean, it's just I mean, it's men, too. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1802.18s)]
*  But normally in history, it's men that do the really openly satanic stuff. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1804.6200000000001s)]
*  Exactly. And women, you know, two percent of violent crime. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1808.54s)]
*  Now it's there. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1810.9s)]
*  It's because it's a crisis. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1812.46s)]
*  And women, particularly, but men as well, buy into whatever they see [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1814.3400000000001s)]
*  as the power structure as a survival mechanism generally. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1818.22s)]
*  It's exactly right. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1820.54s)]
*  But when the power structures of death cult by increment, they get deeper and deeper. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1821.3s)]
*  I mean, you look at these leftists and them in the hundreds of photos, [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1824.86s)]
*  where they took their shot and they or they or they had their abortion [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1828.26s)]
*  or, you know, they want to kill Trump. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1831.62s)]
*  And you look at or they're worshipping death in some way. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1834.1399999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. You can see it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1837.3s)]
*  They all look super unhealthy. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1839.4199999999998s)]
*  They look totally insane in the eyes. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1840.98s)]
*  They look like Charlie Manson. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1842.3799999999999s)]
*  And so so it's it's I've seen more and more love in people's eyes. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1844.06s)]
*  More spiritual connection to God, more and more of that quiet place [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1848.58s)]
*  of just serenity in people. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1852.5s)]
*  And then I'm seeing more and more of the satanic energy. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1854.26s)]
*  So it's really a parting of the sea. Yes. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1856.18s)]
*  So to just linger on the first observation that you're seeing more of the serenity, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1859.34s)]
*  the peace from God in people, that is including people in your orbit, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1864.18s)]
*  people you know personally. Yes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1868.54s)]
*  But it's very paradoxical. I'm seeing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1871.02s)]
*  Just. Godliness. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1873.78s)]
*  Peace, understanding. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1877.94s)]
*  And then I'm seeing confusion and hysteria. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1881.7s)]
*  And I mean, what we're seeing is evil [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1885.1000000000001s)]
*  writhing around, trying to take us with it. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1888.46s)]
*  It gets sense that humanity is waking up [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1891.26s)]
*  and that all of its carefully laid plans to keep us in a trance, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1894.18s)]
*  keep us asleep is burning away. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1896.7s)]
*  Do you is there any way to predict? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1899.14s)]
*  Well, I'll just say my view, which is I I've been really shocked [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1902.7s)]
*  by people on both sides. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1907.22s)]
*  There are people who seem [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1908.78s)]
*  totally seized by hysteria and rage and hate and the desire to commit violence. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1911.02s)]
*  I never expected they would be that. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1916.02s)]
*  And then there are other people who I'm equally shocked to see [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1918.18s)]
*  filled with the kind of serenity you're describing, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1920.8999999999999s)]
*  who are filled with love and understanding. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1923.58s)]
*  And I just I couldn't have predicted who those people are in some cases. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1926.3799999999999s)]
*  Do you feel that? Absolutely. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1930.54s)]
*  I mean, I've always had a lot of. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1932.54s)]
*  Berserker energy and. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1935.5s)]
*  And, you know, in the fight, but it was always focused. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1939.0600000000002s)]
*  And I wouldn't say it was demonic, but it was, you know, of the flesh. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1941.26s)]
*  But I also had a big connection to God. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1944.7s)]
*  Now, more and more, I'm just have serenity, focus, clarity. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1946.54s)]
*  And I'm more effective at breaking things down, not acting like a Tasmanian devil. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1951.3s)]
*  And so in my own life, I'm seeing more and more of that serenity, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1955.9s)]
*  just really, really intense the last few weeks. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1960.02s)]
*  And I picked up on that being around you and your crew and, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1964.02s)]
*  you know, folks here in this little hamlet we're in. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1967.42s)]
*  And then it really does make you feel sorry for people that serve evil. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1971.3s)]
*  I mean, they torture us and they attack us and they want to bully us. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1976.7s)]
*  And but at the end of the day, you actually realize that's on them. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1979.54s)]
*  It is so sad that they live like this. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1984.98s)]
*  They're being destroyed, too. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1987.1s)]
*  They're being destroyed, too. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1988.98s)]
*  That's like one of the main insights I've had in the past five years. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1989.98s)]
*  I come to things really slowly because I'm not a genius. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1992.7s)]
*  But I always kind of felt hate toward the destroyers in our [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1995.18s)]
*  in any society, hate, destruction. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=1998.8600000000001s)]
*  I like building and creation. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2000.8200000000002s)]
*  And but the destroyers always were I felt my enemies in my whole life. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2002.18s)]
*  I felt this. And then it was only in the last couple of years [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2006.42s)]
*  I realized they're being destroyed also. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2008.5400000000002s)]
*  Like they are suffering. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2011.42s)]
*  They're not getting out of this unscathed. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2012.5400000000002s)]
*  Like they think that they're getting power or whatever. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2015.18s)]
*  Money, whatever they think they're getting. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2018.22s)]
*  But in but they're like in agony. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2020.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, a lot of them are cowards, too. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2023.3s)]
*  They think. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2024.82s)]
*  Survival of finish is being as ruthless and mean as possible [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2026.6200000000001s)]
*  is what they have to do to win. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2029.46s)]
*  And then when you no longer hate them and I'm [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2031.78s)]
*  because I was never driven by hate as my main force, it was just the old saying. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2035.74s)]
*  You don't fight an enemy attacking your people because you hate them. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2039.66s)]
*  You fight them because you love the people you're defending. Exactly. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2042.18s)]
*  But still, I would always say no, no, forgive them. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2044.46s)]
*  Still fight them, still expose them. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2048.62s)]
*  But but but but really forgive them. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2050.58s)]
*  That removes a spiritual connection that you have with them. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2053.18s)]
*  And you see it when Christ says, you know, be kind and pray for those that persecute. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2057.42s)]
*  It'll keep burning coals on their head. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2061.7s)]
*  Stalkers, you know, down at the kind of a low level. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2064.74s)]
*  I've learned like once I didn't care about a stalker [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2067.1s)]
*  and I've had plenty and you just forgive them. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2068.94s)]
*  They just freak out and go away when they're getting to you. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2070.62s)]
*  They're enjoying that energy. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2072.9s)]
*  So you still fight them with more energy than ever. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2074.2999999999997s)]
*  But you do it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2076.7799999999997s)]
*  From a position of just removing a damaged, collapsed, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2079.1000000000004s)]
*  you know, poor victim of the devil [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2082.86s)]
*  that you have responsibility to protect yourself and your family from. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2085.7000000000003s)]
*  But you don't give them the energy of being angry back at them [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2087.98s)]
*  and seeing them as powerful because they're not their pawns. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2091.46s)]
*  And these people that are influenced by satanic energy, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2094.5s)]
*  by literal spiritual forces, demons, they are the slaves. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2097.46s)]
*  And when they're not outdoing evil and persecuting people, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2101.2200000000003s)]
*  they don't even feel like they're alive and they're desperate and they're scared. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2103.5800000000004s)]
*  And they're lost. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2107.06s)]
*  And then they get driven forward, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2108.5s)]
*  you know, by this dark force to to like, it'll be all right [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2111.98s)]
*  once you just go out and once you take these people out, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2115.46s)]
*  you know, it's the good people that are making you feel bad. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2117.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, it's it's them destroy them. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2120.58s)]
*  Then you'll have peace. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2123.1s)]
*  And that's the deeper understanding I've had of how this satanic system works. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2124.58s)]
*  So clearly true. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2128.3799999999997s)]
*  And if you ask if there's anyone that you've really like focused on, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2130.5s)]
*  I don't know, George Soros or Larry Fink. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2134.5400000000004s)]
*  I mean, just the other day, I was talking to somebody who knows Larry Fink really well. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2137.02s)]
*  And I was saying, I think Larry Fink is like, I don't know. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2140.5800000000004s)]
*  I've never met Larry Fink, but boy, he's responsible for a lot of suffering [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2142.94s)]
*  from my perspective. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2146.38s)]
*  And, you know, this person said there's no one more unhappy than Larry Fink, like nobody. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2148.1000000000004s)]
*  And I was just with him in a car. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2153.3s)]
*  He was like screaming at someone on the phone. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2154.42s)]
*  This guy's made billions of dollars and personally tormented. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2156.82s)]
*  And I know a bunch of people because I know a lot of the [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2159.82s)]
*  of the people involved in things that I think are really evil. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2162.7400000000002s)]
*  And there's not a happy one among them, not one. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2165.58s)]
*  And beyond the fact that he's got billions, he's in control of more than anybody. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2168.78s)]
*  You know, we're always hearing Elon Musk, we're just kind of in the world. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2173.22s)]
*  Well, he's a guy that has been good at keeping the companies under his control. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2175.42s)]
*  So he independently is the most powerful person. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2179.22s)]
*  Corporate science communications Titan. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2183.98s)]
*  But then they spin it like, oh, he's the establishment. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2188.5s)]
*  No, Trump, as you know, has a very small orbit of independent billionaires [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2190.74s)]
*  that are defending him because they want to stabilize civilization [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2195.2599999999998s)]
*  for everybody's good. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2199.74s)]
*  But when you look at the international power and the largesse, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2200.8599999999997s)]
*  it's been against Trump more and more. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2203.8999999999996s)]
*  They realize they're losing because the people are with Trump. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2205.7799999999997s)]
*  And we were just talking last night. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2208.74s)]
*  I hope you would repeat that [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2210.02s)]
*  because you were asking me with some folks who were talking to about [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2212.66s)]
*  what my view is basically on the geopolitical new landscape. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2215.8999999999996s)]
*  And I laid my view. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2219.1s)]
*  You said, no, I think that's dead on. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2220.14s)]
*  And then you said basically, if you feel like repeating it, that [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2221.3799999999997s)]
*  we need to sell it very clearly. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2225.74s)]
*  You're on this team or you're on that team, because it really is team Chaycom. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2228.02s)]
*  EU globalist new world order. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2231.02s)]
*  That's that's what's left. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2233.42s)]
*  You know, the UK don't trust him who runs it, but they're trying to come in [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2235.1s)]
*  under a US alliance. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2237.7s)]
*  And America and the world needs to understand [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2239.18s)]
*  there's a new international system forming the old one fell. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2241.46s)]
*  And we better decide what this new system is going to look like [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2244.54s)]
*  and who's going to be in charge of it, because that's the way it is. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2247.14s)]
*  So think about how you'll feel when you achieve your biggest goals of all, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2250.14s)]
*  whether it's starting a business, paying off your mortgage, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2255.2999999999997s)]
*  send your kids to college, have the money to pay for it. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2257.74s)]
*  You'll be pretty proud when you've met these essential life goals. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2260.18s)]
*  And you should be proud. All of us are. We do that. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2263.2599999999998s)]
*  But what do you do next? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2265.58s)]
*  So getting to the goals is one thing, but protecting them [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2267.42s)]
*  is an entirely different thing and maybe a bigger thing. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2270.46s)]
*  And this is where life insurance from policy genius comes in. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2273.14s)]
*  Now, policy genius makes finding and buying life insurance really easy. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2276.22s)]
*  You probably want life insurance, but it's expensive. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2280.66s)]
*  And how do you even get it? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2282.5s)]
*  Policy genius makes it simple, and it means that your family has the safety [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2284.46s)]
*  net it needs to cover expenses and to face the future. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2288.3799999999997s)]
*  Nearly half of Americans look back and wish they'd gotten life insurance earlier. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2292.02s)]
*  It can change everything if you have it, because you don't know [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2295.7s)]
*  what the future holds, honestly. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2297.62s)]
*  So with policy genius, you can find policy starting at just two hundred [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2299.4199999999996s)]
*  ninety two bucks per year for a million dollars of coverage. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2302.2599999999998s)]
*  And some options are 100 percent online. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2305.1s)]
*  And that means no unnecessary medical exams for you, which is a win. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2307.34s)]
*  You compare quotes from top insurers side by side. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2312.18s)]
*  You talk to licensed agents, you secure your families tomorrow [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2314.58s)]
*  with peace of mind today, and it makes it super easy on policy genius. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2317.74s)]
*  And it's all transparent. You know exactly what you're getting. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2322.42s)]
*  So you head to policy genius dot com slash Tucker. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2324.18s)]

*  That's policy genius dot com slash Tucker. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2329.66s)]
*  Yeah, and you hope that the questions like that are almost never resolved [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2332.7s)]
*  without big wars, unfortunately. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2336.18s)]
*  You can't think of too many examples or really any in history where they, you know, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2338.86s)]
*  have just sort of evolved gracefully. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2342.18s)]
*  It's a lot of people die. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2347.02s)]
*  And that's, you know, the point. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2348.38s)]
*  You know, Rome falls in the fifth century. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2350.1s)]
*  New system or whatever. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2351.54s)]
*  And I really hope that we can escape that. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2353.54s)]
*  And I'm very opposed to violence and war. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2355.58s)]
*  So I, you know, I think we should all be working toward that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2358.54s)]
*  But it's but it's the big things that matter. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2362.1s)]
*  And you have the rise of the superpower in the East. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2364.38s)]
*  And that's the main factor. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2367.5s)]
*  The moment that we live in is that the West is falling. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2369.9s)]
*  I think it's been undermined from within by people like Larry Fink [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2373.1s)]
*  and many, many others. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2376.02s)]
*  And but it's being replaced by this by this by this threat from the East. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2377.5s)]
*  And I don't hate the Chinese at all. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2383.46s)]
*  I think they're acting in what they think is their best interest. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2384.98s)]
*  They're not Christian. They hate Christianity. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2387.02s)]
*  So you've got a totally different worldview. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2389.3399999999997s)]
*  And I'm not mad at them about it. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2391.2599999999998s)]
*  But I think we should be honest about what it is. Right. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2392.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not we're not going to have like, you know, the United States and Russia [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2395.7799999999997s)]
*  and Iran and Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, China is all sort of acting [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2400.3399999999997s)]
*  in their own spheres. That's not the way it works. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2405.18s)]
*  And as you said last night, all these countries want to be on Team America. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2406.8199999999997s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2410.98s)]
*  And for people that don't know this, I'm surprised. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2411.7s)]
*  I mean, Trump knows understands that you do. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2414.2599999999998s)]
*  But this needs to be everywhere. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2415.66s)]
*  The globalists went in the 80s, 90s. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2418.2599999999998s)]
*  They made a deal with communist China. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2420.46s)]
*  You get the manufacturing rare earth minerals, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2421.78s)]
*  but you don't expand your military into the South China Sea. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2424.3s)]
*  Well, they started 20 years ago expanding everywhere. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2426.9s)]
*  And then it took Obama till about 14 years ago to figure that out. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2430.1s)]
*  We had the Asia pivot. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2432.98s)]
*  But by then it was too late. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2434.02s)]
*  They infiltrated Congress. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2435.5s)]
*  They were financing all this destroy America, wokeism and bragging about it. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2437.54s)]
*  And then people like Bill Gates and others continue to be totally aligned [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2442.54s)]
*  with China. No, it's right. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2446.1800000000003s)]
*  And the CFR saying America is over. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2447.7s)]
*  And Larry Fink making jokes about it just three or four years ago. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2449.7s)]
*  Ha ha ha. You know, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2452.58s)]
*  five years ago, Trump thinks he'll bring America back. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2455.14s)]
*  Ha ha ha. He hasn't seen China. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2457.06s)]
*  I mean, very arrogant. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2458.8199999999997s)]
*  And now that China is even double crossing the globalists and saying, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2460.54s)]
*  we don't even need you. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2464.02s)]
*  And Xi Jinping is like, we're going to pay people to have kids. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2465.3399999999997s)]
*  We're not doing your one child policy more. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2467.5s)]
*  They're breaking with the transhumanist, you know, angle, but using [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2469.2999999999997s)]
*  the control grid, the cashless society, social credit score that the West [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2473.46s)]
*  helped them set up to now project out around the world. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2476.62s)]
*  And so the globalists are being destroyed by their own Frankenstein monster. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2479.2599999999998s)]
*  And then the EU's decided to ally with China. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2483.42s)]
*  And again, the UK is at least on the surface, I think, like, no, they want to be [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2486.7s)]
*  in a new anglophile alliance with the quote US empire. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2489.5s)]
*  And again, the US has a limited window [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2495.94s)]
*  to get everybody on board with us and then our alliance easily with [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2500.2599999999998s)]
*  the key countries in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, central among it [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2504.02s)]
*  and some other alliances. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2508.5s)]
*  And then obviously an open economic alliance with Russia, who wants [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2510.82s)]
*  an economic alliance and has more resources than any country in the world. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2515.1s)]
*  I mean, that is the real chessboard. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2518.78s)]
*  And that's why the left and the globalists want to drive America and Russia apart, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2520.58s)]
*  because geographically and also militarily and then also scientifically [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2524.42s)]
*  and then just raw material. Of course, that is the obvious. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2529.7000000000003s)]
*  If you're if you're if you believe Russia is our greatest enemy, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2532.7s)]
*  if you are working full time to divide the United States from Russia, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2535.58s)]
*  you are acting against the interests of the United States. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2538.2999999999997s)]
*  You hate the United States. You hate the West. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2540.7s)]
*  You want to see it fall. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2542.1s)]
*  They hate Russia because it's a white Christian country. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2543.38s)]
*  That's a fact. Why Russia? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2545.46s)]
*  In all of this, once you take three steps back, makes perfect sense. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2548.66s)]
*  Like we have a lot of people in our country working actively [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2553.02s)]
*  for the destruction of the West, of Christian civilization. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2556.9s)]
*  So that's just a fact. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2560.62s)]
*  This stands in the way. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2562.3s)]
*  I don't you know, people don't like it when you say that, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2563.42s)]
*  but they don't like it when you say it, because it's absolutely true. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2565.02s)]
*  And the farther you get from the United States, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2567.26s)]
*  that's one of the great benefits of travel. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2568.94s)]
*  The more obvious it is like you can't you don't know you're married [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2570.82s)]
*  to an alcoholic until you go on vacation without that person. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2574.0600000000004s)]
*  You're like, oh, shit, I'm married to an alcoholic. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2577.2200000000003s)]
*  Like you can't see any of this when you're in the middle of it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2579.34s)]
*  But when you leave, it's like, oh, my gosh. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2581.54s)]
*  So, OK, I just want to go back a step. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2585.1000000000004s)]
*  So you have made reference a couple of times to the rise in violence, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2587.62s)]
*  the acceptance of violence, which is, of course, the, you know, [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2593.02s)]
*  the purest distillation of evil, in my opinion, most obvious for sure. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2595.66s)]
*  And there are signs that it's, you know, we're entering a violent stage. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2599.86s)]
*  I pray that we're not, but it feels like we are. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2605.02s)]
*  You just had a longtime employee assassinated. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2606.94s)]
*  I don't know the extent to which you want to talk about that. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2609.94s)]
*  But what was that? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2612.1s)]
*  Is it a harbinger of things to come? [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2613.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, a month ago, Jamie White, a great reporter, great guy. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2616.1800000000003s)]
*  We were working up there Sunday night till about nine o'clock. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2620.82s)]
*  I left. He went home and then got shot to the carotid artery. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2622.7400000000002s)]
*  One shot through his neck and then out the back of it. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2625.5s)]
*  He bled to death. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2628.1000000000004s)]
*  By the time I got to the hospital, about 15 minutes later, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2628.98s)]
*  the police got to the very end. How old was he? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2630.86s)]
*  He was 36. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2633.0600000000004s)]
*  And he was on the Ukraine hit list, along with myself and you [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2636.1000000000004s)]
*  and a bunch of other people and everybody getting the SWAT calls. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2640.42s)]
*  The SWAT team sitting in their houses and their families [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2643.74s)]
*  has been on that list as well. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2646.3399999999997s)]
*  It's basically everyone you know. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2647.58s)]
*  Yes. And then, of course, you have Ukraine tortured [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2648.9399999999996s)]
*  American journalist Gonzalo Lira to death and then celebrated that. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2651.8599999999997s)]
*  And so and then, of course, we have the would be assassin down in Marlago, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2656.4599999999996s)]
*  who was a big leftist, connected to all these intelligence agencies, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2663.18s)]
*  recruiting hundreds of fighters for Ukraine, an American. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2666.1s)]
*  Then he comes back and tries to kill Trump. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2669.22s)]
*  So I think I mean, you've seen [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2673.18s)]
*  Alexander Dugan's daughter blown up in front of him in 2022. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2676.9399999999996s)]
*  In Moscow by the Ukrainians in Moscow, murdering a guy's daughter, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2682.98s)]
*  applauded by an apple bomb and all the rest of the ghouls [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2686.3799999999997s)]
*  in the United States effectively, because they don't like Alexander Dugan's ideas. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2689.62s)]
*  So it's OK to murder his daughter with the. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2693.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, that's the new I mean, that's clearly the help of US intelligence. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2696.5s)]
*  I mean, let's stop lying about it. Right. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2699.7799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, I said three plus years ago when the war started, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2701.9s)]
*  I said the US is running all the targeting, of course, there were the weapons. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2704.14s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2707.42s)]
*  And with their soldiers on the ground, as I know, some of the people [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2708.58s)]
*  whose sons are there when it all started were really nervous. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2711.46s)]
*  They didn't give me details. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2713.7000000000003s)]
*  They're like, yeah, our sons are there special operations. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2714.42s)]
*  And there's been a lot of US military personnel fighting Russia in Ukraine. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2718.1s)]
*  Absolutely. I mean, I'm on record three years ago saying that. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2722.54s)]
*  And then two weeks ago, New York Times, the US has been running the war [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2724.3s)]
*  and been there the whole time and get a Pulitzer Prize. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2727.9s)]
*  So that that was all known. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2731.66s)]
*  And so now Trump is trying to rightfully end it. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2734.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, people that don't know, I know your audience knows, but [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2741.3s)]
*  we have Victoria Newland, we have. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2743.9s)]
*  Soros back, we can still talk on for Reed's, our carry on CNN saying, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2746.86s)]
*  oh, yeah, we went there with State Department money and overthrew [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2751.38s)]
*  their government 15 years ago, we did it again. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2753.54s)]
*  And we're finally going to break up Russia and I'm going to be the czar of Russia. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2756.02s)]
*  Five weeks ago, they had the deputy head of the unelected EU commission say, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2759.86s)]
*  oh, we're going to keep this work going for decades and we're going to bankrupt [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2763.54s)]
*  Russia with it and we're going to break Russia in five parts. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2765.98s)]
*  So they're on the news saying we want peace, we want love. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2769.54s)]
*  Oh, no, Ukraine will never join NATO, which is why Putin went in. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2772.6600000000003s)]
*  And the weapons being brought in to his border and then separately, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2775.82s)]
*  Zelensky's always no idea why NATO. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2778.6200000000003s)]
*  And so, again, the West started this war. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2780.94s)]
*  Imagine if Russia. I'm aware. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2785.54s)]
*  I know you know more better than anybody, probably. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2787.66s)]
*  No, it's just hasn't circled. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2790.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, you've actually. Yeah. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2791.58s)]
*  I mean, in the American Journal, she's been everywhere. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2792.82s)]
*  You've documented it. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2794.26s)]
*  And it's just we're starting the fight. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2795.66s)]
*  These crazies are dragging us in to what's really already World War [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2798.3s)]
*  three conventionally, that every escalation moves as close to a nuclear war. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2802.2200000000003s)]
*  The doomsday clock with the atomic energy scientists was the closest ever been. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2806.54s)]
*  And so this is really fundamental. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2810.98s)]
*  And so any concern I have about being sued or law [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2813.02s)]
*  fair or attacked doesn't even hit my psychological, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2815.86s)]
*  spiritual, mental radar, because the big threat is so big [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2820.1400000000003s)]
*  of what these megalomaniacs are doing. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2824.1400000000003s)]
*  So one thing I don't want. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2826.82s)]
*  Fact, I don't think is penetrated. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2828.54s)]
*  The brains of policymakers in Washington is that we just lost a war with Russia. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2831.26s)]
*  The US was running that war. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2835.1400000000003s)]
*  The US military, the Pentagon State Department, CIA running the war against Russia. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2836.78s)]
*  It was not. It was never about Ukraine. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2840.9s)]
*  No one in Washington cares about Ukraine or the hundreds of thousands [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2842.86s)]
*  of Ukrainian men destroyed. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2845.74s)]
*  The fact will be populated by third worlders. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2847.2999999999997s)]
*  I mean, Ukraine, we just eliminated Ukraine. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2849.58s)]
*  Nobody cares. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2851.3399999999997s)]
*  This was a war against Russia. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2852.3799999999997s)]
*  They hate Russia for a lot of reasons, mostly spiritual. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2853.8599999999997s)]
*  But we lost. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2857.74s)]
*  And my concern is because nobody will say that out loud [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2859.5s)]
*  that we're overstating our power. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2863.4199999999996s)]
*  And in the same way that you sometimes see like divorced [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2866.22s)]
*  60 year old guys hitting on young women [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2869.14s)]
*  and don't realize that the young women think this is absurd. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2872.14s)]
*  You're like an old man. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2874.82s)]
*  Why? You really think I'm going to sleep with you? [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2875.7000000000003s)]
*  But the 60 year old guy hasn't readjusted to the reality of his present condition. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2877.6200000000003s)]
*  He still thinks he's 25. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2882.42s)]
*  Do you see what I'm saying? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2884.26s)]
*  And he humiliates himself. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2885.38s)]
*  That can happen at the level of nations where, you know, [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2887.3s)]
*  you think you can affect outcomes that you actually don't have the power to bring about. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2890.6200000000003s)]
*  And so that's called hubris. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2895.98s)]
*  And that's how empires get destroyed and populations vaporized. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2897.82s)]
*  And I'm really afraid of that. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2901.82s)]
*  Like, why can't we should know that we were not able to win a conventional war against Russia. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2903.58s)]
*  Period. So like, what does that say about our power? [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2909.7s)]
*  Maybe we should readjust our expectations a little bit. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2912.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't want that to be true, by the way. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2914.7799999999997s)]
*  I want I'm really I'm American. I'm not leaving. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2916.06s)]
*  My family's buried here. But like. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2918.62s)]
*  Don't you think that we run the risk of thinking we're capable of things [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2920.94s)]
*  that we're not capable of doing? [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2924.02s)]
*  Well, it's an example. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2925.38s)]
*  Hillary had a lot of fraud baked in, but Trump won in such a landslide, he beat her. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2926.34s)]
*  And then a lot of Republicans and conservatives and populists [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2930.98s)]
*  thought Trump was going to win for sure. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2933.42s)]
*  So we'd have as big a turnout. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2934.62s)]
*  So they were able to steal 2020. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2935.7000000000003s)]
*  But there was such a giant landslide this time. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2938.5s)]
*  It overrode the mail in ballots, you know, the dead people, the illegal aliens voting. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2940.66s)]
*  All of that, they ran out of bullets. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2946.46s)]
*  But that's a perfect example of how the Democrats were sure [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2948.86s)]
*  they were going to win in November last year. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2953.54s)]
*  And they were sure they were going to win in November in 2016. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2955.42s)]
*  And they didn't. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2958.3s)]
*  So they had this incredible hubris and this incredible arrogance. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2959.46s)]
*  And so many of them are actually militarily ignorant themselves. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2965.06s)]
*  They just put on this big, imperious act. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2970.34s)]
*  And of course, there's the clip of Sean Penn saying, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2973.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, I don't think nuclear weapons should be off the table. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2976.7000000000003s)]
*  We shouldn't be afraid to use them because that gives Russian advantage. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2978.82s)]
*  Well, it's called mutually assured destruction for a reason, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2981.86s)]
*  because anybody that uses them is insane. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2984.66s)]
*  Well, they got in the middle of the war. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2987.66s)]
*  This just came out the other day. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2990.22s)]
*  The Pentagon wrote an assessment saying that they calculated [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2992.5s)]
*  that if we gave weapons to Ukraine that allowed the Ukrainian military [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=2996.7s)]
*  or our military using Ukraine as a proxy to hit targets within Russia, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3000.1s)]
*  they judged the likelihood of a nuclear exchange at 50 percent. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3003.66s)]
*  And they did it anyway. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3007.82s)]
*  At that point, like you should be in prison for the criminally insane. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3009.02s)]
*  Well, that's right. If Russia moved. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3012.54s)]
*  You're risking nuclear war? [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3015.46s)]
*  Like you should be locked up. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3018.06s)]
*  I don't understand. Like that's the I couldn't even believe that. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3020.14s)]
*  I mean, I, of course, intuitively knew that. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3022.9s)]
*  And say that again, it's not erupted. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3024.82s)]
*  That's important to say again for me that the Pentagon under Joe Biden assessed [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3025.98s)]
*  like as they assess the likelihood of everything or they get, you know, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3030.42s)]
*  they guess they sort of work out how they think things will progress. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3032.82s)]
*  But in every scenario globally, they do this. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3036.2599999999998s)]
*  This is what they do at the Pentagon. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3038.18s)]
*  And they assess that if we gave certain weapons, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3039.86s)]
*  weapons that allowed the Ukrainians to strike targets within Russia, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3042.18s)]
*  if we did that, which we did, the chance of a nuclear exchange, [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3044.82s)]
*  a nuclear holocaust that killed everybody on Earth would be 50 percent. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3049.26s)]
*  And they did it anyway. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3053.42s)]
*  So imagine the brain, imagine the evil. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3054.94s)]
*  Like you would have to be controlled by like supernatural forces to do so. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3058.6200000000003s)]
*  I think there's a 50 percent chance every person on Earth could be killed [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3062.1800000000003s)]
*  in a nuclear exchange, but I'm doing it anyway. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3065.6200000000003s)]
*  Like, why aren't you how are you still walking free? I'm serious. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3068.2200000000003s)]
*  No, and I'm glad you brought that assessment up because I really tried [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3072.14s)]
*  to be able to focus on that. And I agree. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3076.14s)]
*  I agree with that assessment. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3078.14s)]
*  I mean, let's let's boil that down. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3079.86s)]
*  Imagine if Russia had the equivalent of attack on some storm shadows [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3082.5s)]
*  in Canada, in Mexico, on our border, that they can fire above the trees [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3086.5s)]
*  that can't be shot down, that are nuclear capable. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3090.9s)]
*  And Putin said this, he said, [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3093.26s)]
*  if you shoot a few missiles once it started, we'll just shoot them down. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3094.94s)]
*  But if we see a large aerospace attack with a whole bunch of these, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3099.4199999999996s)]
*  we have to believe it is a first strike to take out our nuclear deterrent. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3103.3399999999997s)]
*  And so when we see a large signature of a large aerospace attack, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3108.14s)]
*  be it cruise missiles, be it glide bombs, be it a mix of aircraft or all of them, [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3111.8199999999997s)]
*  we will do a total commitment. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3116.18s)]
*  And then Russia and TV said, here's the government [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3118.1s)]
*  scenario, and it showed nukes [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3121.8999999999996s)]
*  hitting all the NATO countries and submarines, you know, hitting [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3124.58s)]
*  on from there. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3128.94s)]
*  And we're talking about world destroyed in 30 minutes, folks, for sure. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3130.14s)]
*  Submarines off our coast, two minutes, New York's gone. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3133.5s)]
*  You know, five minutes, Dallas is gone. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3136.46s)]
*  This is real. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3139.7000000000003s)]
*  What would happen if Russia was bombing [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3141.86s)]
*  DC with conventional. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3145.26s)]
*  Bombs with large, heavy cruise missiles that that that droning the capital [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3148.86s)]
*  is the US did through the Ukrainians, they droned the Kremlin. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3154.2200000000003s)]
*  You were there once when you saw. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3157.38s)]
*  I was there. I was there. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3158.3s)]
*  I was actually driving by when I was over there last winter to interview Putin. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3159.82s)]
*  I was driving by the Kremlin just like on the street in downtown Moscow, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3164.38s)]
*  smoke coming out of the top of the of the Kremlin. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3168.46s)]
*  And so I called the like the guy at the press office who I was dealing with [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3171.34s)]
*  to set the Putin interview from the vehicle. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3175.26s)]
*  And I was like, I think your Kremlin's on fire. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3176.98s)]
*  And he's like, oh, no, no, no, it's not. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3179.82s)]
*  I was like, I'm right there. I'm looking at it. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3181.2200000000003s)]
*  Russians never want to admit that they have been unable to defend [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3182.82s)]
*  their capital city. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3186.9s)]
*  So they a lot of murder has taken place by the Ukrainians of Russians in [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3187.62s)]
*  and of tempted murder of Americans, by the way. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3192.06s)]
*  And just think about the provocation here. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3194.02s)]
*  And but the Russians in every case like, oh, that's not happening. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3195.9s)]
*  They don't want to admit it because for a bunch of reasons, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3198.38s)]
*  but it would force them to respond. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3201.1800000000003s)]
*  But anyway, I called up and I think you guys just got drone. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3202.54s)]
*  No, no, didn't happen. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3205.7400000000002s)]
*  But it did happen. I saw it. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3207.7400000000002s)]
*  I personally saw it. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3209.1s)]
*  So like there's been a ton of that stuff. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3209.98s)]
*  What would we do if the Russians droned the US [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3212.34s)]
*  capital or the White House? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3215.54s)]
*  That's so freaking crazy. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3217.54s)]
*  Well, Russia knows Russia knows it's a provocation. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3218.98s)]
*  The globalists want to reset their financial systems going down [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3222.66s)]
*  and they're willing to roll the dice. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3226.2599999999998s)]
*  And they think a nuclear war is survival, as you know, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3228.18s)]
*  as the Pentagon has said. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3230.98s)]
*  So it's complete madness. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3232.02s)]
*  Nuclear war is not survivable. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3233.42s)]
*  That's a fact. It's not. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3234.98s)]
*  But nuclear weapon explodes over a nuclear power plant. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3236.46s)]
*  What happens? Anyone know? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3238.62s)]
*  Massive meltdown that makes Fukushima look like exactly. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3239.62s)]
*  And we have a lot of nuclear power plants around the world. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3242.7799999999997s)]
*  There's over 450 that we big that are big industrial, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3244.8199999999997s)]
*  thousands of small ones. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3248.34s)]
*  And when society breaks down, they all melt down in different ways. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3249.9s)]
*  Much worse than Fukushima and Chernobyl combined. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3253.86s)]
*  I agree. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3257.34s)]
*  And it makes the whole surface of the earth, that's mainline science, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3257.86s)]
*  unlivable for hundreds of millions of years. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3260.34s)]
*  I agree. And I know everyone's for nuclear power. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3262.7s)]
*  And it's like, obvious, we need nuclear power. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3265.2999999999997s)]
*  I don't. OK, I'm not against nuclear power in theory. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3267.06s)]
*  But until someone can answer the question you just posed, like, what about that? [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3270.06s)]
*  Plus, they're never run right. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3273.94s)]
*  They always have scenarios where they're not going to leak. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3275.34s)]
*  Basically, they all leak. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3277.46s)]
*  You see all these stupid concerns like the answer is nuclear. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3278.1800000000003s)]
*  You want more AI data centers, comma, which I don't. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3280.46s)]
*  The answer is coal. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3283.26s)]
*  Obviously. But I don't understand why everyone. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3285.1000000000004s)]
*  This is just sidebar. I'll stop in one sentence. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3289.6600000000003s)]
*  But like those of us who grew up in the 70s and 80s [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3291.42s)]
*  remember that all the opponents nuclear power were like, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3293.5800000000004s)]
*  you know, furry armpit dumb people and, you know, all the Greenpeace people. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3296.98s)]
*  And so you're like, oh, shut up. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3301.98s)]
*  Nuclear is obviously the solution. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3303.1s)]
*  Like, you just don't understand science. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3305.34s)]
*  How can you be against climate change and also against nuclear power? [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3306.7s)]
*  I've said that myself, like a hundred times on TV. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3309.98s)]
*  But it's not about the spent fuel rods. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3312.82s)]
*  What do we do with nuclear waste? That's easy. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3315.3s)]
*  Put it in Yucca Mountain. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3316.94s)]
*  It's about what if these things are untended? [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3318.34s)]
*  What if they're, you know, the subject of a conventional or nuclear attack? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3321.06s)]
*  And you look at all the mismanagement. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3325.54s)]
*  Massive vulnerability. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3326.98s)]
*  Like, why doesn't anyone mention that? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3328.14s)]
*  Before we put nuclear power plants all over my country, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3330.06s)]
*  which I think a lot of people are psyched to do [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3332.86s)]
*  because they want to get rich from AI, like they should answer the question. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3335.2599999999998s)]
*  That's really freaking scary. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3338.58s)]
*  No. Well, you have to also ask, why do they build so many here and in Japan? [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3339.98s)]
*  The plants ride on fault lines. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3345.9s)]
*  I mean, there's a real we see a lot of ineptitude in industry and things. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3347.7s)]
*  So you don't want to have things that have the potential to be so dangerous. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3351.9s)]
*  And when coal creates carbon dioxide that plants breathe and the earth, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3355.58s)]
*  you have a lot higher carbon dioxide than it does now. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3359.66s)]
*  And it makes plants live longer. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3361.8999999999996s)]
*  Yields are up. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3363.7799999999997s)]
*  It will green the planet. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3365.06s)]
*  All the studies show it. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3366.7799999999997s)]
*  We're actually terraforming the earth to make it better. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3368.06s)]
*  It's like God given when you actually look at the real studies [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3371.06s)]
*  and talk to the real climatologist, the people, they'll tell you, no, no, no. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3374.1s)]
*  It's great that we're bringing this old carbon back up [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3376.62s)]
*  and putting it back in the atmosphere. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3379.74s)]
*  This is fabulous. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3380.8599999999997s)]
*  More carbon is good. Carbon, carbon dioxide, oxygen, water and sunlight [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3382.1s)]
*  are the four ingredients of life on this planet. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3386.98s)]
*  And the globalists created a way to tax and regulate [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3389.2599999999998s)]
*  one of the four pillars of life on this planet. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3392.3399999999997s)]
*  It is good. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3395.74s)]
*  And again, they try to convince us that cows methane is bad. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3396.62s)]
*  You actually look at the carbon equation. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3400.18s)]
*  It all turns right back into the gases it came from. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3401.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a good guess. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3404.5s)]
*  But again, if the cows are bad, well, what else releases methane? [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3405.8599999999997s)]
*  We do. We're the carbon that they want to reduce. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3409.3399999999997s)]
*  They want to teach us to hate ourselves, teach us not to have a life force. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3412.98s)]
*  And their new religion is they will give us all these indulgences [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3416.4199999999996s)]
*  and all these flagellations and all these things we have to do [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3419.3799999999997s)]
*  to atone for how bad we are to the priest class [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3422.7s)]
*  that is the big satanic green church. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3426.2599999999998s)]
*  So the threat of nuclear war overhangs any conflict [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3428.62s)]
*  with a country that has nuclear weapons, of course, you push someone far enough. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3433.54s)]
*  You know, you don't know what could happen and it could result [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3437.02s)]
*  in the extinction of humanity. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3438.9399999999996s)]
*  So that's like the main fact. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3440.02s)]
*  That's why people want to run not to have nukes. Right. Obviously. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3442.18s)]
*  So. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3445.34s)]
*  With that in mind, what do you make of the public, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3447.26s)]
*  repeated public statements by a bunch of European leaders, particularly Stammer [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3450.94s)]
*  in the UK and and the president of France, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3455.7400000000002s)]
*  that they're ready to like [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3460.78s)]
*  continue the war against Russia with their own people, armies like what? [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3462.5800000000004s)]
*  That seems crazy to what what is that actually about? [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3466.54s)]
*  And they've said that now they're sending their troops that if they get killed, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3469.7400000000002s)]
*  then that's direct war with NATO. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3472.5800000000004s)]
*  They admit that the EU population wise is collapsing. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3475.38s)]
*  Those they brought in, most of them 80 percent never even get jobs. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3478.82s)]
*  That all the different ministers, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3482.66s)]
*  defense ministers, as you know, last few years have said, our business model [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3484.54s)]
*  is a 20 year war. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3487.42s)]
*  They think they can continue that and somehow bankrupt Russia and again, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3489.1s)]
*  break it up into five parts. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3492.38s)]
*  So they've made it existential for themselves. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3494.62s)]
*  They made it existential for Russia. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3497.06s)]
*  And you go back to the Pentagon assessment that was public, that 50 percent chance [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3500.54s)]
*  that if we start bombing and that's the West doing it, mainly the US [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3504.7000000000003s)]
*  inside Russia, they would strike back with nukes. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3508.42s)]
*  And then Putin clarifying, well, we see a large launch. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3510.78s)]
*  It could be a sneak attack with nukes. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3513.5800000000004s)]
*  So we're going to have to go ahead and nuke you at that point. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3514.7400000000002s)]
*  Please don't do that. [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3516.34s)]
*  So at least they limited, you know, to four or five big cruise missile [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3518.0600000000004s)]
*  attacks a day and then, you know, maybe a hundred drones a day [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3522.0600000000004s)]
*  going into major cities and attacking their nuclear bases, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3525.1000000000004s)]
*  their nuclear bomber bases. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3528.46s)]
*  I mean, extreme provocation, testing the line [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3529.7400000000002s)]
*  and not playing Russian roulette where you have a six shot revolver [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3533.86s)]
*  and you put one 357 magnum casing in round in. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3537.14s)]
*  But this is three out of six. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3541.38s)]
*  And they're like, well, that's a safe bet. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3543.02s)]
*  Let's roll the dice, spin the cylinder and then click it to our head every day. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3544.38s)]
*  It just goes the fundamental insanity that you see escalating. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3550.26s)]
*  I mean, if you go back to the actual ins like actual insanity, not, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3552.74s)]
*  you know, I don't know, will tariffs work? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3557.62s)]
*  You know, whatever you could argue. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3560.06s)]
*  But like risking nuclear war, I mean, that's so fucking crazy [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3561.62s)]
*  that I can hardly believe it's real. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3566.62s)]
*  That's a good point. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3568.14s)]
*  They say Trump saying our surrender to these one sided trade deals, [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3568.98s)]
*  which is totally true, and the industrialized this and destroyed them around [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3572.58s)]
*  and as a huge national security issue that he's rolling the dice there. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3575.46s)]
*  No, no, no, it would be rolling dice with nuclear war. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3578.5s)]
*  Again, I think you should be in prison for even having that. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3582.38s)]
*  That's like the craziest thing I can imagine. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3585.14s)]
*  Well, remember, Biden just two years ago said we can't send F16s [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3587.5s)]
*  and Abrams tanks because that escalates the threat ladder of the RAND Corporation. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3590.34s)]
*  That's World War Three. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3593.38s)]
*  But they went ahead and did that. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3594.1800000000003s)]
*  Then they went to the bombing inside. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3595.6200000000003s)]
*  So the reason I went back to that, I'm glad you raised it, is [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3596.86s)]
*  the EU is refusing to end the war. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3599.82s)]
*  We're trying to drag us into it fully. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3602.1000000000004s)]
*  They're arresting their political opposition. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3604.2200000000003s)]
*  Colleen Drogescu in Romania, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3606.86s)]
*  they're not letting him run the new election. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3609.06s)]
*  He's an amazing man. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3610.9s)]
*  I just talked to him. Amazing day before yesterday. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3611.86s)]
*  And then Marlee Le Pen, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3614.58s)]
*  that is super popular and had presidential polls. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3617.1400000000003s)]
*  So they have a judge find her guilty of nothing and take her off the ballot. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3619.18s)]
*  You have the State Department under Biden admittedly working in Brazil [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3622.94s)]
*  with Lula to take Bolsonaro off the ballot because he's popular and then indict him. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3627.22s)]
*  And they're talking about doing it in Hungary. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3632.74s)]
*  They're talking about doing it in Poland. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3634.58s)]
*  They said of AFD-1, which they almost did, that the EU Commission [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3636.4199999999996s)]
*  might cancel that election. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3639.2999999999997s)]
*  So the EU is really taken off the mask. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3641.8199999999997s)]
*  And people that don't know, it was set up in 56 as a steel deal, Tree of Rome. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3644.98s)]
*  And they got the nations over time to sign away their sovereignty to it. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3649.02s)]
*  And I remember an unelected commission [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3652.22s)]
*  with Vanderleid and, you know, up there running all of this. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3655.54s)]
*  And she even came out, as you know, on Monday and said, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3659.42s)]
*  well, Trump's blown up the international order. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3662.38s)]
*  He's he's defeated the New World Order. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3664.1s)]
*  And she said, OK, we're going to go ahead and agree, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3665.98s)]
*  at least in principle, to what Trump is saying. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3669.1s)]
*  And that's because the trade is completely one sided. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3671.74s)]
*  So, again, Trump's move isn't just the perfect move. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3673.62s)]
*  It's perfect in that it's the only moves we have left for us [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3677.1s)]
*  and for global stabilization. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3680.54s)]
*  That's why anybody that cares about self-preservation for the whole planet [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3681.7799999999997s)]
*  should be fully behind Trump's policies [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3685.7s)]
*  that are very popular around the world and are seen as sane. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3689.66s)]
*  And again, the world, this huge alliance of nations wants to join that team. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3694.2999999999997s)]
*  And the good news is Trump's polls are the highest ever. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3699.5s)]
*  I know the American people are understanding that and getting that. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3701.8599999999997s)]
*  The concern is it is kind of crazy that his number. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3707.02s)]
*  I mean, I'm getting to, you know, because I live in a rich people world [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3709.4599999999996s)]
*  for part of the year. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3712.1s)]
*  I know a lot of rich people and boys are really upset. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3713.4599999999996s)]
*  And I share their instinctive concern about any chaos. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3716.9399999999996s)]
*  My parents got divorced. I hate chaos. Right. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3720.58s)]
*  So I get that. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3722.66s)]
*  But but from my perspective, I'll just admit it, like on my phone, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3724.2999999999997s)]
*  it's like I voted for Trump. What the hell's going on? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3727.8599999999997s)]
*  You know, and I get it. I'm not, you know, criticizing anyone. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3729.74s)]
*  But then his numbers go up. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3732.66s)]
*  Well, I like to shows you that you can even I really make a big effort [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3735.14s)]
*  to like live in different places, no different people, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3738.7799999999997s)]
*  not be a captive of my surroundings, not just live among rich people [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3741.3799999999997s)]
*  with like dumb rich people. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3745.46s)]
*  I just like really try to be bigger than that. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3746.46s)]
*  And I always flatter myself that I succeed. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3750.22s)]
*  But even I am like, I guess, kind of captive to that, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3751.7799999999997s)]
*  because then I see the numbers and I'm like, people really like this. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3754.7799999999997s)]
*  His numbers went up after the tariffs. That's correct. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3758.46s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. Wow. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3760.54s)]
*  Well, I like to talk to folks out there saying Trump. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3762.74s)]
*  Is is is being a destabilizer. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3765.02s)]
*  The globalist order was collapsing by their own corruption and mismanagement [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3767.54s)]
*  and their alliance with China being double crossed. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3770.82s)]
*  And so that order was already being collapsed by them. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3773.58s)]
*  And Trump's coming in very pragmatically with a good, fair, freedom based [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3777.62s)]
*  meritocracy, competition based system. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3782.54s)]
*  But to to to to people that want to talk about destabilization, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3786.5s)]
*  starting the war with Russia, totally stabilization, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3790.62s)]
*  dissolving the borders and all the human smuggling and the fentanyl. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3793.66s)]
*  Exactly. Total destabilization in engaging all this overspending. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3796.06s)]
*  And the country basically being bankrupt if we don't go our way out of it. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3800.66s)]
*  Totally stabilization. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3803.7s)]
*  And then wink, wink the attempted assassinations of Trump. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3804.8199999999997s)]
*  What do they think would have happened if Trump really would have gotten killed [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3808.2599999999998s)]
*  in Pennsylvania in July of last year or a few months later in Florida? [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3812.06s)]
*  If you look at the scenarios there, they run from bad to worse. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3816.2599999999998s)]
*  So the real destabilization. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3819.22s)]
*  And bad for the people behind it. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3821.02s)]
*  Like, clearly, those assassinations were not lone gunmen. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3823.22s)]
*  They were part of a much, much larger conspiracy. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3826.14s)]
*  Obviously, everyone knows that. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3829.4199999999996s)]
*  But those people behind those attempted murders would have been in bigger trouble [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3831.8999999999996s)]
*  had those murders succeeded. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3836.3399999999997s)]
*  Attempted murder succeeded. Correct? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3838.1s)]
*  Absolutely. And if somebody is able to kill Trump now, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3839.54s)]
*  people better hope he doesn't get struck by a bolt of lightning [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3842.9399999999996s)]
*  because the bad guys will get the blame. And. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3844.8199999999997s)]
*  That's why so many people that have kind of been on the fence, the establishment, [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3848.62s)]
*  but we're working with the globalists just because that was the system, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3851.98s)]
*  are enthusiastically joining Trump and Elon [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3854.1s)]
*  because they understand that this is the only game in town [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3857.46s)]
*  for people that aren't delusional. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3861.22s)]
*  But you have that megalomania. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3863.98s)]
*  I think that's so true. Yeah. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3865.54s)]
*  You have that megalomania, historically, when elites [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3867.46s)]
*  have never lost before and are losing, that they just continue [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3870.3399999999997s)]
*  to accelerate and intensify. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3873.98s)]
*  And I know you've covered this. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3876.14s)]
*  A lot of the people don't seem to know that in August of 2020, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3877.98s)]
*  I mentioned earlier, there was a big article in the Times with John Podesta [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3881.14s)]
*  covering a war game they just had that if Trump was able to win, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3884.94s)]
*  they were going to have blue states succeed and blue cities to succeed [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3888.3399999999997s)]
*  and then create civil unrest and civil war conditions. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3890.86s)]
*  And then when they knew Trump was going to win [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3894.54s)]
*  because the poll numbers were so incredible [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3896.02s)]
*  a few months before the last election last year, Raskin, Carvel, Podesta, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3897.8199999999997s)]
*  all of them said civil war conditions. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3902.66s)]
*  We're going to need to have uprisings. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3904.82s)]
*  Carvel said that Trump's coming to kill you. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3906.26s)]
*  We got to rise up. Carvel said and others. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3909.1400000000003s)]
*  And they are clearly escalating with the Tesla attacks [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3911.82s)]
*  and the swatting attacks and the calls for violence. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3915.6200000000003s)]
*  The 55 percent of liberal Democrats in the study want Trump killed. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3919.1400000000003s)]
*  They are embracing real terrorism, real domestic terrorism. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3924.38s)]
*  And that's building towards what I believe is in the cards, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3928.82s)]
*  because you see the Democrat pundits [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3932.26s)]
*  and their operatives everywhere before the election [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3933.98s)]
*  and after it in the last 78 days or so saying once you got in office, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3936.46s)]
*  Trump and Tom Homan are going to kill migrants. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3941.9s)]
*  And when they do, there's going to be an uprising. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3945.1s)]
*  And well, Trump's not going to go mow down people at a demonstration. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3948.26s)]
*  You also have them saying Trump supporters are going to attack black people. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3952.3s)]
*  Well, where would black people be alone in big numbers? [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3955.5s)]
*  A church, university. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3957.98s)]
*  Trump supporters are going to kill black people. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3959.62s)]
*  And we know a lot of the globalist groups have been funding [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3961.66s)]
*  white supremacist groups and domestic terror groups [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3964.5s)]
*  and basically run them historically. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3966.8199999999997s)]
*  So the last piece, all the pre-programming I've seen is that [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3969.3399999999997s)]
*  to have these uprisings, there needs something much bigger than George Floyd, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3972.98s)]
*  much bigger than Jesse Spalding. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3976.22s)]
*  And so I am predicting on the current trajectory of what they were [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3978.58s)]
*  going before and what they said, the final piece they need [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3981.94s)]
*  for this destabilization, that they'll label a race based civil war [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3985.2599999999998s)]
*  that will then crash the markets and be used kind of like [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3990.54s)]
*  the predictive programming in the movie that came out last year, Civil War, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3993.2599999999998s)]
*  to have a bunch of states, the main military join them [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=3997.1s)]
*  in a military operation to remove Trump. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4000.98s)]
*  When the Trumpian figure in the movie is killed, you know, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4004.06s)]
*  and executed inside the inside the Oval Office. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4006.3399999999997s)]
*  And so that's their dream. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4010.46s)]
*  That's their backup plan. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4011.7s)]
*  And you have the two camps. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4013.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, one campus is kind of the Chuckie Schumer, completely evil, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4015.7s)]
*  but isn't particularly publicly pushing that. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4018.78s)]
*  Though he had his famous whirlwind. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4021.7000000000003s)]
*  You know, we're coming after you speech. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4023.34s)]
*  But he's an old man. Absolutely. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4024.5800000000004s)]
*  So you have the Soros wing with Alexander Soros that more and more is in charge [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4026.02s)]
*  and is really making a run at escalating domestic [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4030.7000000000003s)]
*  unrest and terrorism, leading into some triggering event starting. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4036.6600000000003s)]
*  Things are aligning for this summer. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4043.2200000000003s)]
*  And I know that folks in the government, their patriots are aware of that. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4044.98s)]
*  But I think that the spokespersons and others need to really get ahead [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4048.94s)]
*  of all this calls for violence and not just repudiated, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4052.1800000000003s)]
*  but talk about the Democrat leadership and their talking heads [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4055.42s)]
*  that are pushing. And I mean, we've seen Koberb just last week say, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4059.42s)]
*  Deep State, please, you know, do something, stop Trump. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4062.5400000000004s)]
*  And so that's where we are. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4065.6200000000003s)]
*  So so so they want to expand war to try to take control of the agenda. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4068.6200000000003s)]
*  They've been hyping a new virus being released, try to stop Trump's [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4073.0600000000004s)]
*  reboot of our economy, because they think that would stop this populist revolution. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4076.1s)]
*  In Europe, it's arresting their political opposition and, you know, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4079.9s)]
*  stopping elections. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4083.58s)]
*  They also have Europe trying to sue Elon Musk and billion dollar fines [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4086.2200000000003s)]
*  trying to shut him down, like we saw with Brazil. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4089.7400000000002s)]
*  So those different strategies, they're also doing big put options [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4093.26s)]
*  and naked shorts, trying to crash the market and then blaming Trump's tariffs on that. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4095.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's economic terrorism, the buildup of domestic terrorism, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4100.06s)]
*  the false flags that can be used, a nuclear false flag to get us into [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4103.78s)]
*  record war with Russia, a new viral release. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4106.98s)]
*  Those are the things they've got set up, ready to go, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4110.86s)]
*  and that they've said before they would use to maintain control. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4114.099999999999s)]
*  Everybody loves and appreciates the first responders when things go haywire. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4116.74s)]
*  They're the ones who show up and make you safe, protect you, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4121.94s)]
*  not just you, but the entire country. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4125.379999999999s)]
*  Most people agree they're heroes. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4127.54s)]
*  But what happens if they can't show up? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4129.78s)]
*  First responders cannot be everywhere all the time. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4132.46s)]
*  And if there's an emergency, particularly a big emergency, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4136.3s)]
*  there aren't enough to go around. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4139.38s)]
*  So you have to be your own first responder. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4140.740000000001s)]
*  Before an ambulance arrives, for a doctor can help. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4142.9400000000005s)]
*  It is up to you to protect yourself and your family. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4145.34s)]
*  And if it's a medical emergency, you could be out of luck [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4148.3s)]
*  because you don't have the right medications. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4151.1s)]
*  Most people do not have the medications they need at home. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4152.780000000001s)]
*  There's an answer to that. It's called the Jace case. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4157.14s)]
*  It's a simple but smart solution to a problem. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4159.58s)]
*  Most people don't even think about it. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4161.5s)]
*  It's a set of emergency prescriptive medications [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4162.94s)]
*  curated by medical experts. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4166.7s)]
*  You've got peace of mind knowing that no matter what happens, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4168.22s)]
*  you are totally prepared. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4171.14s)]
*  Even if you're a prepared kind of person with stuff stored in your cellar, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4173.46s)]
*  you probably don't have the right medications. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4177.42s)]
*  What if there's an infection or any kind of crisis [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4180.26s)]
*  and you don't have access to first responders? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4184.38s)]
*  You're going to want a Jace case, medications on hand [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4187.1s)]
*  when they matter most. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4190.5s)]
*  Go to Jace.com and use code TUCKER at checkout for a discount. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4192.42s)]
*  Jace, J-A-S-E dot com. Check out code TUCKER. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4197.22s)]
*  The first thing in countries that descend into darkness that happens [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4201.46s)]
*  is speech is controlled. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4205.26s)]
*  And there are political police who put people who speak out [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4207.54s)]
*  against the regime in jail. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4210.38s)]
*  And that's happening in Brazil, as you know. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4211.38s)]
*  It's happening in the UK. It's happening in Germany. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4213.860000000001s)]
*  Trying it in Canada. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4217.62s)]
*  It's definitely happening in Canada. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4218.86s)]
*  And these were formerly free countries in Australia. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4220.9s)]
*  And so the one place that it isn't going to happen right now [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4223.9s)]
*  is the United States because of the First Amendment. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4227.0599999999995s)]
*  So how do you end First Amendment protections? [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4228.5s)]
*  Will you pick off people like you, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4231.219999999999s)]
*  which they've been trying to do for over a decade? [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4233.58s)]
*  And I happen to be, as I've told you many times in private, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4235.98s)]
*  I happen to be on a fishing trip when I worked at Fox [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4239.0199999999995s)]
*  the night that you were taken off the air. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4242.5s)]
*  And I thought it was one of the greatest threats of speech [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4244.66s)]
*  in the United States that I'd ever seen. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4246.66s)]
*  I wasn't there and Fox News prevented my co- my fill-in host [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4248.38s)]
*  from defending you because Alex Jones is bad. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4252.139999999999s)]
*  OK, that's what I realized. They were in on it. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4254.7s)]
*  But they need to end speech in the United States. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4256.62s)]
*  They need to shut down acts. They have to. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4260.86s)]
*  And my guess is, and I hope I'm wrong, [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4263.46s)]
*  that there is like legitimate hate and extremism on social media, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4267.099999999999s)]
*  to the point where it makes me uncomfortable. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4271.5s)]
*  I'm thinking that maybe a lot of that is manufactured, actually. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4273.98s)]
*  And that if there is a mass shooting, and God forbid, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4277.9s)]
*  but if there is a mass shooting of the people [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4281.54s)]
*  who've been targeted for hate on- actual hate, that's true, [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4284.58s)]
*  on social media, that that will be used as a pretext to shut it down. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4289.219999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. And- [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4292.66s)]
*  Has this occurred to you? [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4294.66s)]
*  Yes. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4295.62s)]
*  Because I see people on social media who I know for a fact, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4296.7s)]
*  or I think I know, are being funded by the very people [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4301.82s)]
*  they're attacking. It's like, what? [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4305.0599999999995s)]
*  Including one of the biggest voices. I know that that's true. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4308.299999999999s)]
*  And so, what is this? [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4310.58s)]
*  And it's clearly preparatory to some sort of event [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4312.54s)]
*  that will shut down- a violent event that will be used [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4318.62s)]
*  as a pretext to shut down free speech. Am I being paranoid? [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4321.299999999999s)]
*  No, that's where all the foundation's been laid. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4323.9s)]
*  Actually, the superstructure has been built. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4328.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4330.179999999999s)]
*  They're just putting the finishing touches on it. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4330.66s)]
*  And so, in a way, it's fortuitous that I'm here today, [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4332.299999999999s)]
*  because you were here, Ross, talking to my lawyer, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4335.179999999999s)]
*  before we started taping, we got some really big news [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4336.94s)]
*  that in Connecticut, the Supreme Court said, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4340.139999999999s)]
*  we're not even hearing your appeal now, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4342.379999999999s)]
*  because it was so strong, the kangaroo show trial [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4344.339999999999s)]
*  that I went through there a few years ago, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4347.139999999999s)]
*  where the judge had already found me guilty. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4349.379999999999s)]
*  Guilty of what? Of having an unauthorized opinion, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4351.74s)]
*  of being mean or whatever? [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4355.54s)]
*  Those are all legal under the US Constitution. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4357.0599999999995s)]
*  You cannot be punished for giving your opinion. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4359.9s)]
*  I don't care how ugly other people think it is. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4362.139999999999s)]
*  And you've contested whether you even gave that opinion, [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4365.3s)]
*  but it doesn't matter. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4367.02s)]
*  Under our system, you're allowed to say what you think, period. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4368.42s)]
*  Well, you're right, especially— [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4370.860000000001s)]
*  That's what the Bill of Rights is. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4371.66s)]
*  We have the Supreme Court rulings [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4373.26s)]
*  with the New York Times Sullivan. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4375.3s)]
*  Insane. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4376.66s)]
*  Brandenburg versus Ohio, you have a right to your opinion. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4378.7s)]
*  And what they did was, with all these PR firms [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4381.900000000001s)]
*  and massive thousands of articles, sometimes a month [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4385.3s)]
*  and hundreds of TV programs a year, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4387.42s)]
*  they built a straw man once I was censored off the internet [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4390.06s)]
*  in the last seven years. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4392.74s)]
*  Still on my website, infowars.com, [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4393.98s)]
*  still on some talk radio, but it was the verboten thing. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4395.46s)]
*  People had to go get underground. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4398.0599999999995s)]
*  They could then build a straw man of things [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4400.179999999999s)]
*  I had supposedly done I never did. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4402.0599999999995s)]
*  And then when I wasn't defended other than people like you, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4404.46s)]
*  it set the precedent to then come after everybody else, [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4407.0599999999995s)]
*  including President Trump, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4409.0599999999995s)]
*  when he was taking off everything on January 6th, [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4410.66s)]
*  so people couldn't hear him saying, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4412.74s)]
*  be peaceful before, during, and after. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4414.0599999999995s)]
*  I defended black nationalists who hate whites. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4415.54s)]
*  Obviously, I don't agree with them. I am white. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4418.86s)]
*  It's one of my kids. I reject their program. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4420.66s)]
*  But they were indicted for giving their opinions, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4423.18s)]
*  and we cannot allow that. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4425.860000000001s)]
*  And now the ACLU is just completely captured. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4427.820000000001s)]
*  It's like a tranny organization, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4430.02s)]
*  nothing to do with free speech. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4431.62s)]
*  Where are the people who will stand up [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4433.3s)]
*  for the foundational right [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4434.9800000000005s)]
*  that separates a free man from a slave, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4437.3s)]
*  which is the right to say what you think? [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4439.46s)]
*  And why were they all so, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4440.900000000001s)]
*  may they bask in shame for not defending you? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4442.38s)]
*  I mean that. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4446.26s)]
*  Well, I have a major update. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4447.1s)]
*  In the last seven years of them suing me [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4448.22s)]
*  and this whole saga, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4450.660000000001s)]
*  we now have basically all the pieces [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4451.82s)]
*  of exactly what happened. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4453.7s)]
*  I told you some about it last night. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4454.74s)]
*  It would take a few minutes, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4456.58s)]
*  but I could just give people [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4457.42s)]
*  a basic summation of what's happened. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4458.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4459.94s)]
*  But first, just an example of free speech. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4461.219999999999s)]
*  In Texas, there's famous cases [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4463.0599999999995s)]
*  where they take people's small children, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4464.82s)]
*  because the school secretly convinces them [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4467.099999999999s)]
*  with grant money, they get paid for it, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4468.82s)]
*  public and private, that a little boy's really a girl, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4470.46s)]
*  a little girl's really a boy. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4473.34s)]
*  Then the parents find out the school's been [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4475.34s)]
*  putting them in a database, giving them a social worker, [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4477.54s)]
*  sending them to special school times [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4479.9s)]
*  with peer pressure of other kids [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4482.26s)]
*  that have been put in the cult [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4483.1s)]
*  for sterilization, transhumanism. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4484.5s)]
*  And then they take the person's child, saying it's abuse, [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4486.7s)]
*  when you argue, you know, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4489.74s)]
*  my son is really a boy, not a girl. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4490.58s)]
*  Well, now Colorado and the House, as you know, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4492.5s)]
*  just passed the bill, it's in the Senate, [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4494.26s)]
*  and they allowed no debate, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4497.0199999999995s)]
*  saying that if a parent finds out their kid [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4500.0199999999995s)]
*  is being brainwashed and says, [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4502.3s)]
*  no, my son is a boy, my girl's a girl, [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4503.42s)]
*  that is abuse and they're gonna officially take your child. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4506.5s)]
*  Other states have passed laws like Oregon and Washington. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4509.14s)]
*  You talk about free speech, this is beyond that, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4512.26s)]
*  this is parental rights, this is everything. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4514.34s)]
*  Now say parents can't argue and say to the state [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4516.66s)]
*  that has determined that your child's under sex. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4520.38s)]
*  And then in places like New Jersey and other states, [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4524.18s)]
*  the hospital systems now have on the form [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4529.14s)]
*  when your child's born dozens of things, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4532.1s)]
*  transgender, all these other names, genderqueer, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4534.46s)]
*  all these things where the parents pick at birth [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4539.82s)]
*  what the baby's gonna be and say this. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4542.9s)]
*  So if the state wants to come and say they're in other sex, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4546.14s)]
*  that's okay, if parents don't like it, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4549.42s)]
*  their kid gets taken to these areas, [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4551.06s)]
*  that's where this is going, it's already happening. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4552.38s)]
*  But if the parents wanna opt in, [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4554.66s)]
*  they can decide for their child. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4556.38s)]
*  So as long as you decide that we're gonna chemically [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4557.7s)]
*  and then medically sterilize surgically [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4560.38s)]
*  this poor little person that's being put [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4562.66s)]
*  into this death cult, then it's okay. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4564.54s)]
*  The only thing you're not allowed to say is no, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4566.46s)]
*  I say no to this designation. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4568.62s)]
*  So that's where Alex Jones having his speech [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4572.34s)]
*  massively attacked goes. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4575.62s)]
*  So it's a long story, but here's the summation. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4576.7s)]
*  I didn't understand, even though I know a lot of things [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4580.46s)]
*  about politics in the world, [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4583.3s)]
*  I didn't understand how PR firms work, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4584.9s)]
*  how law firms work, how the deep state was operating. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4586.86s)]
*  And they later admitted even on MSNBC that a few years ago, [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4589.46s)]
*  oh, we've been successful with Alex Jones, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4592.54s)]
*  next we're gonna do it with people like Tucker Carlson. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4594.98s)]
*  And then they mentioned you. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4597.34s)]
*  Hillary knows she's in trouble. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4599.3s)]
*  Two months before the election, 2016, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4602.4s)]
*  she does a 20 plus million dollar ad buy talking about me [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4604.76s)]
*  and twisting what I had said about that event [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4608.54s)]
*  in Connecticut, that mass shooting. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4610.54s)]
*  And then the ad she says, Alex Jones is Trump's brain. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4612.42s)]
*  This is the guy that Trump says is an amazing person. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4615.14s)]
*  We'll be talking a lot, you're a great guy. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4617.42s)]
*  And they show that clip of Trump on my show saying that. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4618.78s)]
*  So they created a demonized version of me to attack Trump. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4621.5s)]
*  Then that made me this huge demon with the left even more. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4625.66s)]
*  Then for two years, articles every day, [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4629.18s)]
*  sometimes dozens a day, TV shows, programs, PBS, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4631.34s)]
*  CNN, MSNBC, every channel, foreign news, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4634.54s)]
*  Tokyo news, Russian news, it was being pushed over. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4638.3s)]
*  Alex Jones is bullying kids, parents of dead kids, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4641.099999999999s)]
*  Alex Jones is sending people to pee on graves. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4644.88s)]
*  None of that ever even happened, much less me. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4646.66s)]
*  And then they sue me and then they want all this discovery [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4649.54s)]
*  and they say, who do you work for? [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4651.82s)]
*  Who's telling you what's doing the Republicans [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4652.86s)]
*  in all these depositions? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4654.66s)]
*  Of course it wasn't there. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4656.18s)]
*  So they hold me in default for saying [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4657.38s)]
*  I didn't give them my secret plan to get rich off these [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4661.22s)]
*  people that I barely ever even talked about. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4663.62s)]
*  They put 22 minutes of evidence in the Texas show trial [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4665.16s)]
*  where I was found guilty by the judge [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4667.62s)]
*  and the Connecticut show trial that were only a month apart [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4669.1s)]
*  in 2022 in the fall. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4671.36s)]
*  So I go in, HBO's producing it, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4674.22s)]
*  cameras putting makeup on the judges. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4676.26s)]
*  I'm given 20 plus things I can't talk about. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4678.66s)]
*  My lawyers are sanctioned if they try to raise that. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4681.5s)]
*  Where did Alex Jones say this? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4683.78s)]
*  Where did he do this? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4684.84s)]
*  No evidence can be showed to counter them. [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4685.98s)]
*  They could just say whatever they wanted to. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4687.54s)]
*  And then they have a billion and a half dollar judgment [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4689.599999999999s)]
*  in Connecticut. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4691.26s)]
*  They have a $50 million judgment total [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4692.099999999999s)]
*  or $49 million in Texas because I'm already found guilty. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4694.58s)]
*  Then the judge tells them to say how guilty I am. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4698.62s)]
*  They lie and totally exaggerate all the money I have, [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4701.26s)]
*  say I got it from these people with no evidence. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4703.74s)]
*  And so I knew I was being railroaded for my speech. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4706.26s)]
*  They said in the Connecticut trial [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4708.4s)]
*  and in the Texas show trial and on the court, I'll steps, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4710.0s)]
*  we don't want money from Mr. Jones. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4713.06s)]
*  We wanna shut him down. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4714.9800000000005s)]
*  They said that in court filing. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4717.22s)]
*  So I go into bankruptcy [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4718.26s)]
*  because I'm out of money personally, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4719.3s)]
*  never had all this money they said, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4720.5s)]
*  not even a fraction of it. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4721.740000000001s)]
*  And so for three years I'm in bankruptcy [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4723.56s)]
*  and they keep going and say, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4725.320000000001s)]
*  we don't want money, we want him closed. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4726.46s)]
*  The judge keeps saying, no, [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4728.38s)]
*  you have to actually do a settlement with him [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4729.9800000000005s)]
*  or we have to sell him for wars. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4733.900000000001s)]
*  And this is all because you said something [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4735.46s)]
*  that other people said they were offended by? [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4736.9800000000005s)]
*  Yes, but- [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4739.1s)]
*  How can you, I don't understand in a free country [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4740.58s)]
*  how other people being offended by what you say [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4743.66s)]
*  can have you destroyed by the state. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4748.34s)]
*  Well, it's more than that. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4750.3s)]
*  They said I sent people to their houses, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4751.42s)]
*  I peed on graves, all this stuff that nobody did. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4753.86s)]
*  Why weren't you arrested? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4758.14s)]
*  You can't pee on a grave. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4758.9800000000005s)]
*  Why weren't you arrested? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4759.900000000001s)]
*  I've never been to Connecticut. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4760.74s)]
*  Why weren't you arrested for peeing on the grave? [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4761.58s)]
*  Out of the people that sued me, [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4763.14s)]
*  I only said the name of one of the people ever. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4764.54s)]
*  If you commit a crime, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4766.42s)]
*  you should be criminally charged for it [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4767.66s)]
*  and the state has to prove that you did it, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4769.16s)]
*  at which point you're convicted and punished. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4770.599999999999s)]
*  If the state accuses you of something [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4772.84s)]
*  but doesn't charge you with it, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4774.68s)]
*  they're fucking liars. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4776.599999999999s)]
*  Like by definition, they don't, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4778.12s)]
*  that's not on the list of options [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4780.04s)]
*  that they can just discredit you, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4781.96s)]
*  attack your character, destroy you. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4783.32s)]
*  No, no, no, the state has one option. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4784.96s)]
*  If you committed a crime, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4786.5199999999995s)]
*  they charge you with the crime [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4787.5599999999995s)]
*  and they prove you did the crime. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4789.16s)]
*  It's that simple. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4790.5199999999995s)]
*  That's right, and I never got investigated [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4791.36s)]
*  for stalking or anything because I did nothing. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4792.84s)]
*  For any crime. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4794.12s)]
*  So here's where it gets crazy. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4797.32s)]
*  Here's what we've learned [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4799.48s)]
*  since they had the show trials. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4801.16s)]
*  I noticed none of the libertarians defended you either. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4802.96s)]
*  Where was the Reason Foundation and Cato [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4804.68s)]
*  and all these supposedly freedom-minded nonprofits [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4806.4s)]
*  who were just freaking liars? [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4809.28s)]
*  Like none of them defended you that I know of. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4810.72s)]
*  Bare minimum, they were bought off [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4813.36s)]
*  or they wanted to keep their head down. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4814.639999999999s)]
*  So here's what we learned. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4815.639999999999s)]
*  The Democratic Party and the Justice Department, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4817.92s)]
*  the FBI and the CIA, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4819.9s)]
*  this has come out in court, come out in documents now [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4820.88s)]
*  and we've got it all out, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4822.68s)]
*  published it at Infowars. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4823.5199999999995s)]
*  They could be shut down literally in days now. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4824.48s)]
*  We're finally up to the wire today with this big ruling. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4826.32s)]
*  The truth's out there but they don't want you to know it. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4829.72s)]
*  So they come after me to demonize Trump. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4831.76s)]
*  Then they run ads on Facebook and Twitter and everywhere [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4834.24s)]
*  for the two years before they sued me, 2017, 2018, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4838.6s)]
*  saying I'm attacking them, saying I'm coming after them, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4841.36s)]
*  using my name to raise money. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4843.64s)]
*  Okay, it turns out hundreds of millions using my name. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4845.28s)]
*  This has come out. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4847.4400000000005s)]
*  Saying I'm victimizing them [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4848.400000000001s)]
*  and then never showing what I supposedly did. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4850.0s)]
*  Just this man's hurting us, help us, help us. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4851.72s)]
*  Then I was already taking off the internet after that [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4854.04s)]
*  for other reasons that they cooked up. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4856.44s)]
*  They had Lester Holt get up on TV and say, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4860.5199999999995s)]
*  Alex Jones called for people to get battle rifles [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4864.639999999999s)]
*  and go attack Democrats. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4868.2s)]
*  No, I talked about them, Antifa attacking your house [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4869.48s)]
*  and how they were planning to attack more people's houses [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4872.679999999999s)]
*  and I said none of us are gonna be violent [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4874.36s)]
*  but I said everybody needs to have their battle rifle ready [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4876.24s)]
*  or their shotgun in their home [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4878.839999999999s)]
*  if the left comes to kill you. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4879.919999999999s)]
*  Well, as someone whose house was attacked by Antifa, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4881.08s)]
*  I agree completely. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4882.96s)]
*  But then Holt never showed what I supposedly said. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4884.92s)]
*  He just said straight up, okay, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4887.24s)]
*  so I wasn't even taking off the internet for Sandy Hook [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4889.44s)]
*  because I wasn't even known for that, okay? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4892.16s)]
*  Barely ever talked about it. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4894.0s)]
*  Then they sue me, then they run more PR, [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4896.32s)]
*  then they raise more money off of me [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4898.72s)]
*  and then when they didn't find anything in their, [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4901.08s)]
*  all their discoveries, there was nothing that I did, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4903.68s)]
*  then they have the judges both find me in default, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4906.72s)]
*  coordinate for both trials to be held [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4909.92s)]
*  in a month and a half period in late 2022 [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4911.64s)]
*  and then right after they win, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4914.8s)]
*  the jury's fine for all this money, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4916.68s)]
*  they come back and they say, [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4919.320000000001s)]
*  that's not enough, Your Honor, we want 2.75 trillion. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4920.160000000001s)]
*  That's the GDP of India. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4923.88s)]
*  People don't believe that. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4925.8s)]
*  It's type in Alex Jones, Sandy Hook, 2.75 trillion [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4926.64s)]
*  and so the judge said, no, you just get 1.5 million. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4931.64s)]
*  In retrospect, did you ever think [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4934.56s)]
*  when they awarded a judgment against you [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4936.120000000001s)]
*  equivalent to the GDP of India, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4938.160000000001s)]
*  did you ever think like, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4939.5199999999995s)]
*  maybe I should keep my visions to myself [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4940.719999999999s)]
*  and not like next time I see 9-11 coming, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4943.679999999999s)]
*  I just shouldn't say anything [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4945.719999999999s)]
*  because people who predict the future accurately [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4946.679999999999s)]
*  are always punished for it. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4948.839999999999s)]
*  I think that's, I mean, [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4950.24s)]
*  I mean, yeah, I mean, well, what I realized was [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4951.719999999999s)]
*  I've got something important to say, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4955.4s)]
*  so I better say it even louder [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4956.759999999999s)]
*  because the evil wants this shut down, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4957.959999999999s)]
*  but just to finish the key part, I'm telling you. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4959.44s)]
*  Sorry, sorry. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4961.28s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4962.12s)]
*  You're just making me upset hearing this. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4962.959999999999s)]
*  No, no, no, I'm saying I haven't gotten to the big stuff. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4963.799999999999s)]
*  I'm just giving people the background. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4966.0s)]
*  This is not the country I grew up in at all. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4966.839999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying that, sorry. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4969.46s)]
*  Well, no, no, you're right. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4970.3s)]
*  Thank you for the platform. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4971.14s)]
*  No, thank you, Tucker. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4971.96s)]
*  And I told you all this last night. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4973.02s)]
*  It took 30 minutes. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4974.34s)]
*  Let me just try to condense it. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4975.18s)]
*  So I know they're trying to demonize me to get at Trump. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4976.5s)]
*  I know they're trying to set the president [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4979.7s)]
*  to shut down everybody else. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4980.82s)]
*  And once I'm demonized, they think nobody will defend me [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4982.06s)]
*  and that sets the precedent. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4984.02s)]
*  They admitted all that. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4984.86s)]
*  Then when they win the show trial, it was already fixed, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4985.94s)]
*  these PR firms come out of New York and Connecticut [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4989.78s)]
*  and go, we've been doing this for years. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4991.74s)]
*  We exposed Jones. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4993.7s)]
*  We did this. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4994.94s)]
*  We helped get this big win, blah, blah, blah. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4995.78s)]
*  Then this undercover video comes out [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=4998.58s)]
*  that is in a predator sexting trolling operation in DC, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5003.18s)]
*  which the guy was never implicated in, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5007.7s)]
*  but that's how he got caught up with the troll, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5009.18s)]
*  trolling operation. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5010.94s)]
*  This Oblevis person, CIA and FBI, it's confirmed, says, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5012.3s)]
*  well, we investigated Alex Jones for years at the FBI. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5018.06s)]
*  Then he went on to CIA, that's where he's currently. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5021.02s)]
*  And he said, we couldn't find anything criminal on him. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5024.54s)]
*  So we went to the Sandy Hook people with law firms [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5027.04s)]
*  and we developed this plan with this narrative [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5029.4s)]
*  to take him down. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5032.08s)]
*  And now we're in the process of shutting him down. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5033.54s)]
*  And the person says, well, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5037.0s)]
*  are you still trying to put him in prison? [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5038.0s)]
*  No, we've just destroyed his name and destroyed who he is. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5039.2s)]
*  It's all on video, it's online. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5042.36s)]
*  Just type in FBI, CIA agent, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5043.5199999999995s)]
*  admits to running Sandy Hook, framed job of Alex Jones. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5046.96s)]
*  We recommend you take this moment [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5051.4s)]
*  to do what we're about to do, which is enjoy an Alp. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5052.68s)]
*  So, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5057.04s)]
*  just to kind of refresh our baseline assumptions here, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5065.32s)]
*  is the CIA allowed to destroy people in the United States [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5068.72s)]
*  for criticizing? [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5072.48s)]
*  No, it's illegal. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5073.32s)]
*  Oh, it's illegal, okay. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5074.14s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5074.98s)]
*  Begging the question, but absolutely. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5075.96s)]
*  So then we have that, but then I go, wait a minute, [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5076.94s)]
*  at the trial last year, they have this FBI agent [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5081.76s)]
*  who was the chief counsel, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5084.16s)]
*  who on the stand, they say it, to hide it in plain view, [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5087.12s)]
*  the Democrat Party law firm talked to him for like a day. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5091.0s)]
*  And he goes, so you went and got the suit [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5093.6s)]
*  against Mr. Jones? [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5095.0s)]
*  Yes, I went to your law firm, Mr. Koskoff, [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5095.84s)]
*  and I went to the families, you know, [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5099.2s)]
*  and I organized him to do this. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5100.92s)]
*  So they're hiding in plain view [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5102.360000000001s)]
*  the chief counsel of Connecticut [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5103.84s)]
*  that I didn't even pick up on at the time. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5105.8s)]
*  Why is he on the stand? [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5107.08s)]
*  I'm sitting there talking about how he went [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5107.92s)]
*  and set this up and did this to me. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5110.88s)]
*  Then later we have Oblevis talking about years ago, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5112.84s)]
*  we criminally investigated him for a decade, [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5115.8s)]
*  we couldn't find anything, so we went into this civilly. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5117.6s)]
*  So now that's two of them admitting it [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5120.88s)]
*  on the stand in undercover video. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5122.360000000001s)]
*  Now this is where it gets wild. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5124.4400000000005s)]
*  Then three days after Trump's in office, [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5126.400000000001s)]
*  we done a four year request two years ago for my FBI file. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5128.900000000001s)]
*  We done it many times, they never responded back. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5132.28s)]
*  Soon as Trump gets in, they send us a disc in the mail. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5134.64s)]
*  I got a call from the FBI saying, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5138.24s)]
*  hey, be sure you watch your mail. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5139.360000000001s)]
*  And they send me a disc of our four year [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5141.88s)]
*  and it was 196 files, but it was just the cover sheets. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5145.36s)]
*  It said the rest of national security, but it said, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5147.92s)]
*  Alex Jones, top national security threat. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5149.84s)]
*  Obama administration ordered me to be a level three [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5152.72s)]
*  terror national security threat in 2013. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5155.88s)]
*  I had Carl Serafinon who knows how to read the code documents [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5158.96s)]
*  on the dozens of pages I got that were attached. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5161.4800000000005s)]
*  He said probably the thousands, [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5163.76s)]
*  but 196 other investigation packets. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5164.8s)]
*  And we're talking weekly and monthly meetings [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5168.32s)]
*  out of the Boston field office. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5171.160000000001s)]
*  And Trump didn't learn about this as first admin. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5172.0s)]
*  So we learned this was going on until I was sent this [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5174.0s)]
*  by the new FBI director, or the new FBI. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5177.0s)]
*  And it's just the cover sheets, but they have codes on it [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5180.0s)]
*  that Carl Serafin used to run counterterrorism and the FBI, [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5182.3s)]
*  huge whistleblower, came on my show for hours [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5185.580000000001s)]
*  and documented what it meant. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5187.6s)]
*  Then he talked to his sources currently in DC [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5188.8s)]
*  and they said, yeah, we're actually on this, it's bad. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5190.4400000000005s)]
*  So Obama illegally had me declare [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5193.400000000001s)]
*  a national security threat, [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5195.84s)]
*  open criminal espionage investigation. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5196.8s)]
*  With huge resources, humet, attempted infiltration, [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5200.8s)]
*  that's all the codes. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5203.68s)]
*  And that's now makes sense. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5204.76s)]
*  People we hire trying to set us up, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5206.200000000001s)]
*  trying to get us to commit crimes, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5207.76s)]
*  all this stuff over the years, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5209.52s)]
*  hacking into our surveillance camera systems, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5210.84s)]
*  trying to find something dirty, all sorts of sabotage. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5212.56s)]
*  So now I mean, I'm living in a spy movie. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5216.38s)]
*  So we get that like 10 days in the Trump administration, [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5217.72s)]
*  three days in, they mail it, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5221.72s)]
*  it comes to the mail like seven days later. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5223.240000000001s)]
*  So now we have that. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5224.56s)]
*  So we have Obelis admitting it from the FBI and CIA. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5225.580000000001s)]
*  We have the other lead counsel in Connecticut [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5227.6s)]
*  committing it on the stand, proud of it. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5231.2s)]
*  I didn't complain to you, just because they knew [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5232.04s)]
*  it would come out. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5233.5199999999995s)]
*  Then we get another FBI contact and they say, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5234.5199999999995s)]
*  why don't you go look at the federal register [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5238.5199999999995s)]
*  and look for money going to these Sandy Hook foundations [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5241.28s)]
*  of the people that sued me. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5244.839999999999s)]
*  We go look, it's $4 million plus in payments to them [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5246.4s)]
*  right after they sued me and then two payments to them [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5250.5s)]
*  during when both trials started. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5254.24s)]
*  So one payments from whom? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5256.74s)]
*  From the Justice Department. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5257.92s)]
*  So tax dollars? [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5259.0s)]
*  Tax dollars, over $4 million from the Justice Department [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5260.88s)]
*  were paid to the main Sandy Hook foundation [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5264.6s)]
*  that is on the board and the head of it [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5267.92s)]
*  for the people suing me that ran it. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5270.44s)]
*  This is crazy. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5272.4800000000005s)]
*  So now we have the Justice Department [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5274.4s)]
*  and I'm releasing those documents. [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5276.96s)]
*  I was actually planning to release them today, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5278.36s)]
*  a week ago before you invited me out here. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5280.14s)]
*  So that's all gonna be out today, the documents all of it, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5282.74s)]
*  but it's online, they don't hide it. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5286.12s)]
*  Also millions and millions and millions more [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5288.04s)]
*  of COVID money went to them. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5289.88s)]
*  And you know what happened to Cory Bush's husband, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5293.16s)]
*  I'm not saying it's illegal, it should be looked into. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5295.48s)]
*  So this is why this is important. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5298.12s)]
*  This is the most open and shut, start to finish operation [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5299.64s)]
*  we've ever seen with all this money [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5305.24s)]
*  directly from the Justice Department, [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5308.02s)]
*  the Justice Department admitting they initiated it [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5309.2s)]
*  undercover tapes with the CIA. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5310.88s)]
*  Then you have the FBI admitting on the stand [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5312.52s)]
*  that they initiated it. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5314.06s)]
*  Then you have the money directly from the Justice Department [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5315.24s)]
*  to them directly when they're attacking me [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5317.56s)]
*  and then it gets worse. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5319.56s)]
*  In the last year in my bankruptcy, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5321.240000000001s)]
*  before that they attached a US trustee [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5325.240000000001s)]
*  who's taking over federal law to my bankruptcy [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5327.72s)]
*  like I'm in Ron, most people don't have this happen. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5329.92s)]
*  So there's Justice Department lawyers and agents [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5332.0s)]
*  at my depositions giving me US code to read [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5334.080000000001s)]
*  before the deposition, after I'm sworn in [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5336.18s)]
*  that if I say anything incorrect, [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5338.96s)]
*  they're gonna charge me with felonies. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5340.160000000001s)]
*  But I still don't take the fix, I've done nothing wrong [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5342.84s)]
*  and I have accountants and it's all lies. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5344.76s)]
*  They're alleging I've stolen hundreds of millions of dollars [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5346.54s)]
*  from these people, none of that's true, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5348.14s)]
*  don't have hundreds of millions of dollars, [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5349.58s)]
*  never had $10 million of extra laying around. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5350.7s)]
*  What, that you stole money from what people? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5352.62s)]
*  They just say I harassed them, I made money off them, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5354.54s)]
*  it's their money, it's just all made up. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5356.68s)]
*  But I have the Justice Department there. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5358.38s)]
*  So then the Justice Department has the US trustee [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5359.46s)]
*  in May of last year order a private security company [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5362.5199999999995s)]
*  on a Friday evening to show up with guns on their sides [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5366.26s)]
*  and say everybody out of the building. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5369.66s)]
*  And I say where's the court order? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5371.6s)]
*  And I say call the head of your security company. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5373.3s)]
*  I get on the phone and he goes, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5374.62s)]
*  I'm telling the people this too, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5375.54s)]
*  we gotta have a court order. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5377.66s)]
*  I'm gonna tell them no. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5378.9s)]
*  They showed up at your office? [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5379.74s)]
*  They showed up at my office. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5380.7s)]
*  With guns? [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5381.54s)]
*  Armed security, yes. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5382.7s)]
*  And so I call my lawyers, [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5385.74s)]
*  they don't even believe it's happening. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5387.18s)]
*  We get a hearing and the judge blocks it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5388.42s)]
*  Then he has a full evidentiary hearing June 14th. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5390.7s)]
*  Fires the US trustee, removes them, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5393.62s)]
*  removes the CRO that did it, okay, in the bankruptcy [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5395.46s)]
*  and then appoints a new one [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5399.86s)]
*  who comes in to be all buddy buddy. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5401.82s)]
*  Then he says, okay, we wanna sell it [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5404.62s)]
*  and then that way proceeds of sold infowars. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5407.22s)]
*  But then we have buyers that are good, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5409.38s)]
*  they'll keep it going. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5411.1s)]
*  The Sandy Hook family's really democratic party [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5412.26s)]
*  says we don't want money in court filings, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5415.14s)]
*  we want it shut down. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5417.88s)]
*  The judge says, no, you will sell it at an auction, [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5419.14s)]
*  but cash auction. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5420.9s)]
*  Then they have a auction date set. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5422.04s)]
*  The day before they say that's canceled, [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5424.38s)]
*  it'll be private bids turned in on that Monday [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5426.0199999999995s)]
*  and then the next day we will tell you who the winner is. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5429.3s)]
*  Well, then it was the Bloomberg financing, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5431.0199999999995s)]
*  his Everytown group. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5433.0599999999995s)]
*  Everybody heard the onion had gotten infowars, [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5435.26s)]
*  remember that? [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5437.14s)]
*  Back in November. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5440.3s)]
*  So all that happened. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5442.62s)]
*  So we counter sue, the judge has hearings [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5443.46s)]
*  on December 9th and 10th, [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5446.4800000000005s)]
*  says there was never an auction, it was fraudulent. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5447.78s)]
*  You guys need to settle this [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5451.900000000001s)]
*  and you need to get money from Mr. Jones' buyers [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5453.74s)]
*  and it needs to stop. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5456.38s)]
*  They come back to the judge three times [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5457.5s)]
*  and say we don't want money, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5458.9800000000005s)]
*  we don't ever want it sold, we want it shut down. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5460.56s)]
*  So the judge said about a month ago, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5463.82s)]
*  he said, okay, I'm done, this has gone on three years, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5466.0599999999995s)]
*  take it to state court. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5468.42s)]
*  The state court is Judge Bellis [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5470.46s)]
*  that did the show trial with HBO [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5472.179999999999s)]
*  or that's Judge Gwere Gamble in Texas, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5475.179999999999s)]
*  that's the other judge in Connecticut. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5477.0199999999995s)]
*  So it's Judge Gwere Gamble, [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5479.86s)]
*  just like Judge Bellis running the show trial, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5481.84s)]
*  finding me guilty. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5483.299999999999s)]
*  She has said as soon as she gets that, [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5484.58s)]
*  she's gonna send in the constables from the county [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5486.74s)]
*  and just close the doors, lock it. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5488.7s)]
*  Because they don't want the money that it can produce. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5490.0199999999995s)]
*  They don't want any of that, they want it shut down. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5492.7s)]
*  Can I just ask you a reality based question here? [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5495.54s)]
*  So all of this stems. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5497.7s)]
*  Sorry, that's such a long story. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5499.46s)]
*  No, no, no, no, it's a shocking story, [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5500.38s)]
*  but I just don't wanna lose the baseline. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5503.179999999999s)]
*  And it's never been told in full. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5505.26s)]
*  The baseline facts, okay, so all of this stems [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5506.78s)]
*  from a school shooting in Connecticut. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5510.26s)]
*  12 years ago. 12 years ago. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5513.0599999999995s)]
*  And you suggested on air [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5515.0s)]
*  that there was something weird about this. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5517.42s)]
*  I covered other people saying that. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5518.82s)]
*  Correct. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5520.5599999999995s)]
*  You did not commit the school shooting. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5521.78s)]
*  No, Adam Lanza did. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5522.98s)]
*  Adam Lanza did. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5524.38s)]
*  And I said for years, I believe it happened [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5525.54s)]
*  before they sued me. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5526.98s)]
*  Right, so we spent approximately zero time [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5527.82s)]
*  and zero money as a country trying to figure out [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5530.18s)]
*  why would Adam Lanza murder all these children? [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5532.0199999999995s)]
*  We're all against murdering children. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5534.44s)]
*  Some of us are against murdering all children, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5535.94s)]
*  including in foreign countries [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5537.9s)]
*  and here in abortion clinics, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5539.26s)]
*  we're just against murdering kids, okay? [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5540.099999999999s)]
*  So I'm not gonna cede the moral high ground [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5541.22s)]
*  on kids to ghouls like this. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5543.32s)]
*  So, okay, but we have no idea why Adam Lanza did this. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5546.86s)]
*  No one's trying to find out. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5549.82s)]
*  You instead are being blamed, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5551.1s)]
*  or the father of four kids, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5553.1s)]
*  for the murder of all these kids [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5555.42s)]
*  when you had literally nothing to do with the murder at all [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5556.42s)]
*  and the actual murderer is probably brain fried [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5558.26s)]
*  in SSRIs or whatever, the cause, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5561.06s)]
*  like no one cares. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5563.620000000001s)]
*  That's right, he was on SSRIs, [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5564.580000000001s)]
*  like almost all of them, exactly, [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5566.02s)]
*  and here's the finale. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5567.38s)]
*  But like no one cares. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5569.02s)]
*  It's like all these people jump up and down, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5569.9800000000005s)]
*  including some of these parents, I assume, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5571.320000000001s)]
*  and like I understand they're upset [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5573.46s)]
*  their kids are murdered. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5574.820000000001s)]
*  I mean, I have true compassion for them, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5575.660000000001s)]
*  but they're blaming you for it? [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5578.4400000000005s)]
*  And then raising money, hundreds of millions off my name, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5580.099999999999s)]
*  and his mother bought the gun legally, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5583.799999999999s)]
*  and then Remington was bankrupted by it [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5586.66s)]
*  and paid $73 million to them. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5588.299999999999s)]
*  Remember that, it just goes on and on. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5590.86s)]
*  And after they sued me, [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5592.7s)]
*  this one foundation's increase went up [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5595.0599999999995s)]
*  while they were suing me, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5597.66s)]
*  and during the show trials, 375%, [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5598.5s)]
*  let me give you the actual numbers, [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5604.46s)]
*  337% to 119 million just during that period, [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5605.62s)]
*  and their main fundraiser was me, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5611.62s)]
*  not to mention all the Justice Department, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5613.54s)]
*  four plus million they got, but here's the- [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5615.0599999999995s)]
*  Blaming you when you say the fundraiser was you, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5617.66s)]
*  they were blaming you for a mass murder [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5619.9s)]
*  that you were horrified by and didn't commit, [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5621.86s)]
*  and ignoring the actual mass murderer, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5625.32s)]
*  blaming everyone but the murderer for political reasons. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5627.24s)]
*  So like they're destroying you. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5629.32s)]
*  They would just say, it's like that meme [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5630.42s)]
*  where Indiana Jones moves the idol [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5632.38s)]
*  and puts the bag of sand on there. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5633.7s)]
*  They removed Lanza and just put me on there, [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5635.08s)]
*  and it was, he's coming, he's harassing us, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5637.2s)]
*  he made all this money off of us, [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5639.0199999999995s)]
*  he's bullying, he's sending the stalkers, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5640.92s)]
*  he's attacking, help, help, help, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5642.96s)]
*  with just ads everywhere, help, help, [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5644.92s)]
*  help us find Alex Jones, help, help, help. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5646.44s)]
*  And I hadn't talked about him in years and years, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5648.72s)]
*  only talked about one of their names. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5650.94s)]
*  I never even knew who this FBI agent was, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5652.5s)]
*  none of my crew said his name. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5654.0599999999995s)]
*  My lawyer got up and said, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5655.36s)]
*  have you ever, Alex Jones ever said your name? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5656.32s)]
*  No. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5657.64s)]
*  Any of his crew ever said your name? [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5658.48s)]
*  No. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5659.36s)]
*  You ever post your picture? [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5660.6s)]
*  Ever talk about you? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5661.72s)]
*  No. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5662.5599999999995s)]
*  When's the first time you heard about Alex Jones? [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5663.4s)]
*  In 2016? [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5665.76s)]
*  And then he goes and does all this, [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5667.04s)]
*  but here's the finale, here's the finale. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5668.4800000000005s)]
*  This is what I know when you talk to Trump and others, [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5670.4s)]
*  this is important because this needs to be looked at. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5672.4400000000005s)]
*  This is conspiracy against rights, [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5674.86s)]
*  we're getting ready to take action on this legally. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5676.96s)]
*  This is a violation of process. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5679.04s)]
*  This is racketeering, I mean, cut and dry in my view, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5682.52s)]
*  and that's what my legal experts agree as well. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5684.52s)]
*  It's cut and dry. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5686.4800000000005s)]
*  Turns out Paul Weiss, the big law firm [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5688.32s)]
*  that lost its intelligence agency, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5691.2s)]
*  the clearances because they targeted Trump [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5693.88s)]
*  and they admitted to it, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5695.64s)]
*  they came to Trump a month ago and they said, [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5696.88s)]
*  give us back 50 plus percent of our business, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5698.400000000001s)]
*  let us have our national security clearance. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5700.4800000000005s)]
*  We promise to stop doing lawfare [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5702.22s)]
*  against you and your supporters, [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5703.92s)]
*  and this is an agreement, [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5705.64s)]
*  and we'll spend $40 million on pro bono work [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5707.08s)]
*  that's non-political. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5709.68s)]
*  It's in the agreement, okay? [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5710.92s)]
*  And that's by the way, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5712.92s)]
*  our legal action's about to come out. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5713.76s)]
*  They just filed that 40 million of that 20 [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5715.12s)]
*  is their suit of me, and they list the lawyers. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5718.16s)]
*  That's their pro bono work? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5720.52s)]
*  And they've been coordinating the entire bankruptcy assault. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5721.68s)]
*  They came up with the fake auction on record. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5725.12s)]
*  That's come out in our depositions of them. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5727.12s)]
*  We're suing them currently, but more is coming. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5728.400000000001s)]
*  They came up with the plan with the US trustees [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5731.12s)]
*  multiple times to have fake auctions, [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5733.72s)]
*  and the judge said it was a fake auction. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5735.92s)]
*  They're the ones that sent armed security in [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5737.72s)]
*  on Friday evening. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5739.56s)]
*  I was leaving at like seven o'clock, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5740.400000000001s)]
*  and there's all these guys showing up [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5741.56s)]
*  from the security company we'd already used for eight years, [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5743.400000000001s)]
*  but all these guys never seen. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5745.16s)]
*  They're like, hey man, we're told that they're closing the [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5746.4400000000005s)]
*  doors to kicking you out for good tonight at nine. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5748.240000000001s)]
*  We shouldn't have told you this, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5750.8s)]
*  but I knew one of the guys, [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5751.68s)]
*  and but now it's under the court. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5753.56s)]
*  And then I get on the phone with the head [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5755.64s)]
*  of the security company, and he goes, listen man, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5757.04s)]
*  he goes, I got this lady saying, [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5760.08s)]
*  I'm a just department official, Melissa Hazelton, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5761.52s)]
*  and her lawyer, Freeman, Melissa Hazelton, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5764.04s)]
*  Melissa Freeman, and they're telling me, [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5770.24s)]
*  we are just department officials. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5771.64s)]
*  You must close it. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5773.56s)]
*  He said, no, I want a court order. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5774.72s)]
*  So then I had to sleep up there [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5776.320000000001s)]
*  because they tried to hire another security company [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5777.52s)]
*  the next day, and I knew it. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5779.4s)]
*  And I wanted- [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5781.16s)]
*  To steal your office from you. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5782.0s)]
*  Listen, when they did the fake auction the next day, [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5783.96s)]
*  they came and turned the internet off [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5786.639999999999s)]
*  because they knew I was going to appeal it, [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5788.36s)]
*  and the judge shut that down too. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5789.599999999999s)]
*  And I was out of there for a few days, [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5791.599999999999s)]
*  so there was such an outcry, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5793.0s)]
*  and the judge ordered to let us back in the building. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5793.839999999999s)]
*  We've been kicked out repeatedly. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5795.839999999999s)]
*  Once I wouldn't leave- [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5798.12s)]
*  Of your own building. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5798.96s)]
*  Of our own building. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5799.92s)]
*  So, but Paul Weiss has been running this whole thing [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5800.759999999999s)]
*  with Koskof and Koskof. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5808.04s)]
*  It's basically a total deep state operation [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5810.36s)]
*  with Senator Blumenthal and his son. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5812.12s)]
*  Okay? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5814.4s)]
*  So this is on record. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5815.24s)]
*  So here they are telling Trump, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5820.36s)]
*  oh yes, we'll stop doing lawfare [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5821.639999999999s)]
*  against you and your people. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5823.96s)]
*  And then now they're billing that [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5825.12s)]
*  in the basic fine they agreed to with Trump. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5827.48s)]
*  That's what it is, an official fine. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5829.32s)]
*  They are telling Trump, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5830.799999999999s)]
*  we're going to stop our attacks on your supporters and you. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5833.04s)]
*  And now they think Trump, [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5835.96s)]
*  they know he's busy, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5838.16s)]
*  that he won't learn that they've done this. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5839.04s)]
*  So in my view, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5841.12s)]
*  they need serious sanctions from the White House. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5841.96s)]
*  If this isn't about me, I'm tough. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5844.0s)]
*  This is about this saga. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5845.28s)]
*  Everything I've told you is even worse than I'm telling you. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5847.16s)]
*  The insanity of what they've done [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5849.96s)]
*  and the persecution would take days [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5853.92s)]
*  because they had four court ordered [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5856.84s)]
*  that my company had to pay for. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5859.64s)]
*  And then if the money didn't come in, [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5861.68s)]
*  we would make it through those investigations. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5862.84s)]
*  I'd tell listeners, hey, buy our products. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5864.84s)]
*  We've got to pay to be investigated. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5866.64s)]
*  Four different investigations, [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5868.320000000001s)]
*  forensic accountants looking for dirt. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5869.52s)]
*  They had the IRS audit me for a year. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5871.160000000001s)]
*  We got a $4.3 million tax return back. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5873.0s)]
*  The IRS says we never do this. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5875.400000000001s)]
*  It went into the bankruptcy [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5876.52s)]
*  because I'd overpaid 4.3 million in five years [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5877.56s)]
*  because I tell my CPAs, overpay. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5879.8s)]
*  I know those because I don't have a target. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5882.4800000000005s)]
*  So there are three years of investigation. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5885.4400000000005s)]
*  I got a $4.3 million check back and none of it was true. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5887.52s)]
*  And then even the New York Times last year had to say, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5892.160000000001s)]
*  well, it turns out Jones had meager resources [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5894.4s)]
*  and never really had anything. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5896.92s)]
*  It was all lies. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5898.599999999999s)]
*  So it was all lies I did anything to him. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5900.08s)]
*  It was all lies I made money off of. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5901.639999999999s)]
*  It was all lies I had all this money. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5902.96s)]
*  And the point is, is now to last night, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5904.879999999999s)]
*  the Connecticut Supreme Court said, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5909.08s)]
*  we're not even going to hear your appeal [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5910.92s)]
*  and which is ironclad, abuse of process, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5914.4s)]
*  all the rest of it. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5917.679999999999s)]
*  Texas, the judge violated three laws, cut and dry. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5919.48s)]
*  I mean, the cap is at $5 million. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5924.4s)]
*  She said, I don't care about the Texas cap. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5926.2s)]
*  I'm doing 45 and the change was 49. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5927.639999999999s)]
*  They just don't care. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5930.24s)]
*  And it's the same in all of this lawfare, [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5931.36s)]
*  just like a judge found from- [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5934.839999999999s)]
*  You never did anything. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5935.92s)]
*  You never broke any laws. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5937.12s)]
*  They would have indicted you. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5938.599999999999s)]
*  Like this is all so hallucinogenic. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5939.599999999999s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5942.799999999999s)]
*  Well, imagine it's like I'm their chew toy [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5944.0s)]
*  and they just chew on me. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5946.599999999999s)]
*  But your crime, look, I just want to refer you [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5947.839999999999s)]
*  to the very first moments of this conversation [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5950.28s)]
*  when I pointed out once again for the 100th time, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5952.92s)]
*  you called 911 in detail before 911. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5955.04s)]
*  So that is like, just from my perspective as an outsider [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5958.92s)]
*  and someone who knows you, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5962.32s)]
*  that's like the defining fact of your life. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5963.16s)]
*  That's the first sentence of your obituary. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5964.24s)]
*  No one did that, only you. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5965.92s)]
*  That fact, I think, is responsible [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5968.0s)]
*  for everything that has come after. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5971.24s)]
*  Well, just exactly. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5972.68s)]
*  But just think of the scandal. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5973.52s)]
*  On record, Kyle Seraphon, and he showed me the conversations [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5974.84s)]
*  with high level FBI, they're investigating it. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5978.08s)]
*  He's going to come back on the show, I think tomorrow, [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5980.16s)]
*  or Friday, famous whistleblower. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5983.52s)]
*  He read the documents, and we got a lot from it, [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5986.84s)]
*  but he explained, I mean, this is like terrorist designation. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5990.0s)]
*  This is espionage. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5994.84s)]
*  So I've had a full espionage, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5995.92s)]
*  counter espionage operation against me, [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5997.88s)]
*  trying to find something for 10 years. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=5999.56s)]
*  So where's the DOJ? [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6001.08s)]
*  Where's, I mean, this is a test [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6002.56s)]
*  for the new Department of Justice, [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6004.0s)]
*  brought in on the explicit promise to end the corruption, [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6006.56s)]
*  stop using our justice system, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6009.64s)]
*  which my ancestors helped build and yours too, [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6011.92s)]
*  as a political army mobilized [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6014.32s)]
*  against domestic political opponents. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6017.72s)]
*  That's not allowed. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6019.56s)]
*  That's like Haiti stuff. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6020.52s)]
*  We don't do that. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6021.72s)]
*  It's not a Tonton Makut, it's the FBI. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6022.8s)]
*  They promised to do that. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6025.84s)]
*  So can they help you? [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6027.56s)]
*  Are they helping you? [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6028.84s)]
*  Well, I mean, I'll say this. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6029.76s)]
*  Trump cut and dry had the same stuff done to him. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6032.0s)]
*  He's the only person on a wider scale that has had this. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6035.8s)]
*  And you'll hear him say, it's unbelievable. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6039.24s)]
*  It would take a long time. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6040.88s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6042.52s)]
*  I've studied the cases of you. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6043.360000000001s)]
*  It's the same kind of crap. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6044.2s)]
*  A judge in New York finds him guilty, [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6045.04s)]
*  doesn't give him a jury trial. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6045.96s)]
*  I mean, it goes on and on. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6047.16s)]
*  So what they've done to me, they wanna do to you. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6049.280000000001s)]
*  But if you want that string [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6051.56s)]
*  that pulls the whole sweater apart, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6053.0s)]
*  they think because the demonization [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6055.400000000001s)]
*  and what they said I did to kids I didn't do, [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6056.84s)]
*  that the Republicans will be scared to ever defend me. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6058.72s)]
*  Oh, that's for sure. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6061.12s)]
*  When in truth, it's like the Mendez brothers [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6062.360000000001s)]
*  where people found out what they went through. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6064.96s)]
*  They learned that they'd all been lied to about that. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6066.12s)]
*  Well, this is like that. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6067.8s)]
*  This is like what the story you've heard, folks, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6069.12s)]
*  from start to finish isn't that. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6071.74s)]
*  They saw I was famous. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6073.76s)]
*  They saw I was big. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6074.72s)]
*  They tied me to Trump to try to hurt him. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6075.6s)]
*  Then they raised hundreds and hundreds [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6077.32s)]
*  of millions of dollars off of me, [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6078.5599999999995s)]
*  got Justice Department money, had show trials, [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6080.0s)]
*  put out all this stuff I didn't do on record. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6082.68s)]
*  And then now are not just trying to kill [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6085.6s)]
*  the Second Amendment using these poor dead children [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6088.5199999999995s)]
*  who have God rest their souls, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6091.5599999999995s)]
*  but the First Amendment as well. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6092.6s)]
*  So this is outrageous. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6094.68s)]
*  And it's a bellwether showing that Paul Weiss, [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6098.0s)]
*  that big Democrat law firm, one of the top ones, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6101.88s)]
*  would literally tell Trump, [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6104.04s)]
*  okay, we'll stop doing political persecution. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6105.360000000001s)]
*  We admit to it. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6107.4800000000005s)]
*  They confessed to lawfare against him [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6108.4400000000005s)]
*  and his supporters, his family. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6110.72s)]
*  And then they're still doing it to me [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6112.96s)]
*  and they're billing the money they said [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6116.1s)]
*  that he'd pay in me. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6118.02s)]
*  So it's a sick joke. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6119.64s)]
*  They think Trump won't learn about this. [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6120.96s)]
*  And at the end of the day, I just want it to stop. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6123.88s)]
*  And look, we've survived so much. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6125.88s)]
*  People say, oh, they were gonna shut you down here. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6129.64s)]
*  They were shutting you down there. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6131.2s)]
*  It's in the news they kicked us out of the building [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6132.04s)]
*  in November. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6134.16s)]
*  It's in the news they kicked us out in, [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6135.0s)]
*  or try to kick us out in May of last year. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6136.64s)]
*  There was a bunch of other stuff that happened. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6140.16s)]
*  My big deal is I'm not gonna give up [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6142.2s)]
*  because they've said we wanna get the name Infowars. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6144.88s)]
*  We wanna confuse it and have Schubacabras and Bigfoot. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6147.0s)]
*  And we're gonna act like we're Alex Jones. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6150.92s)]
*  They claim they own my ex account, [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6152.68s)]
*  Musk had to sue, get involved, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6154.68s)]
*  and have them back off of that. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6156.400000000001s)]
*  The Democrats in their filing in bankruptcy [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6158.400000000001s)]
*  six months ago said that the amendment against slavery, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6160.9400000000005s)]
*  what is it, 13 to 14, 13, doesn't apply to me. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6165.540000000001s)]
*  You can read it in Bloomberg from the filing. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6168.4400000000005s)]
*  They said he is a special type of person. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6170.200000000001s)]
*  And so just like Prince signed away his rights [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6172.6s)]
*  to a record company for his name and his music, [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6175.52s)]
*  I never signed away my rights. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6177.400000000001s)]
*  So they're saying they own the name Alex Jones [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6179.0s)]
*  in the court filing. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6181.0s)]
*  They say they know the name Rilal Jones. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6182.08s)]
*  They're saying they own all my catalog of material, [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6183.92s)]
*  even though it's always been free to air [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6186.5199999999995s)]
*  and is my political views and is open. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6188.12s)]
*  They can't do that. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6189.96s)]
*  I can write a book and publish it to the world [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6190.84s)]
*  and say it's free. [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6192.36s)]
*  Somebody can't sue me and get a bankruptcy later [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6193.48s)]
*  and say they own a book I gave away copyright free. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6195.44s)]
*  My show is owned by the world, [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6198.48s)]
*  but what is it they don't want? [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6200.12s)]
*  It's because my older shows, going back 30 years, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6201.72s)]
*  are ultra green. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6204.68s)]
*  They're not evergreen where they stay the test of time. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6206.96s)]
*  They get more important. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6209.16s)]
*  And so the system knows that those clips [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6210.56s)]
*  are getting hundreds of millions of views, some of them, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6213.68s)]
*  where I lay out and predict hundreds of subjects [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6215.72s)]
*  and what's gonna happen. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6218.6s)]
*  And then I explain though. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6220.400000000001s)]
*  So that intellectual property is at stake. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6221.52s)]
*  They are preposterously, this is new law. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6224.4800000000005s)]
*  They think off of demonized Alex Jones, they say this, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6227.84s)]
*  they can set a precedent to not just censor you, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6230.92s)]
*  not just take Tucker Carlson off the air [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6234.04s)]
*  and they said you're the next target, literally. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6235.6s)]
*  They say the clips you didn't see them on CNN, MSNBC, [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6237.4800000000005s)]
*  that they will then take your identity, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6240.2s)]
*  which under the prohibition of slavery [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6242.84s)]
*  and under the prohibition against slavery [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6245.76s)]
*  in the Texas Constitution and all the others, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6247.08s)]
*  you can't take someone's name, [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6248.5599999999995s)]
*  you can't even take someone's tools [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6250.88s)]
*  under state law in Texas. [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6252.76s)]
*  But no, they are saying that they own the name Alex Jones. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6255.32s)]
*  And they own your archive of content. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6257.8s)]
*  Yes, and they say that they want to twist it [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6260.679999999999s)]
*  and make fun of it. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6263.04s)]
*  They had the onion owner with the Everytown Bloomberg [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6264.36s)]
*  representative on it, they let Bloomberg pay for it. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6267.16s)]
*  The onion owner is just an intel cutout. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6269.5199999999995s)]
*  Absolutely, from MSNBC he was just. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6271.44s)]
*  I'm very aware, yes. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6273.04s)]
*  Censorship operator, that was his job. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6274.04s)]
*  Yeah, and who has literally no sense of humor at all. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6275.639999999999s)]
*  He's the most humorless drone working on behalf [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6278.04s)]
*  of entrenched power, like in the United States [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6281.32s)]
*  and he's running the comedy site. [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6283.24s)]
*  It's like the Babylon Bee, it's also fake. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6285.799999999999s)]
*  And he's the MSNBC version of Brian Stelter. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6287.959999999999s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware, I'm aware. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6290.5599999999995s)]
*  I know, exactly. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6291.799999999999s)]
*  So what I'm saying is it's a constellation of operatives, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6293.16s)]
*  corporate, media, government, justice department, [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6296.04s)]
*  trustees, all of them, and they just like an army [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6298.8s)]
*  believe they're still gonna beat America. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6302.2s)]
*  Oh, I know. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6304.04s)]
*  And they see me as a populist firebrand folk hero [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6304.88s)]
*  and they say that themselves and they want to silence [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6308.4800000000005s)]
*  and destroy that person so they can then take the identity [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6311.2s)]
*  of that and turn me into Satan. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6314.04s)]
*  So. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6315.84s)]
*  Meanwhile, Adam Lans is the guy who murdered [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6316.96s)]
*  all those children is totally forgotten. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6318.8s)]
*  Yeah, and I almost apologize, I don't really talk about [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6320.4400000000005s)]
*  this a lot on my own show, it's just come to a head today [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6323.24s)]

*  But I mean, folks, this is your country, your world. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6327.84s)]
*  This was done. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6330.16s)]
*  What I've told you is 10% of it, okay? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6331.16s)]
*  I mean, this is an incredible scandal. [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6333.4400000000005s)]
*  The law firm that confessed to Trump [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6336.04s)]
*  to try to destroy him illegally with lawfare, [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6338.56s)]
*  it said, don't worry, sir, we'll do $40 million [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6341.360000000001s)]
*  of good work, non-political. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6343.84s)]

*  They have gone and filed that half of our 40 million [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6348.56s)]
*  is what we've done to Alex Jones. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6351.6s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6353.12s)]
*  I mean, look, I don't care what happens to me. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6354.6s)]
*  I just hope Trump takes away their national security [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6356.92s)]
*  clearance because they're not gonna stop what they're doing [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6359.72s)]
*  and those other law firms know exactly who they are. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6361.84s)]
*  I agree, and you'd love to talk to the person [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6364.36s)]
*  who negotiated that deal and see if he's aware of it. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6366.52s)]
*  Oh, I wonder who that is in the White House. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6368.8s)]
*  Maybe they should be looked at a little bit. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6371.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6373.28s)]
*  So. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6374.12s)]

*  I'm just speculating here, that's why we need [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6379.92s)]
*  to investigate because I mean, you know this [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6381.36s)]
*  in racketeering laws they passed. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6384.68s)]

*  to your grocery store, and then they burn [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6390.36s)]
*  your grocery store down, they start investigating [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6392.12s)]
*  and they learn how the criminal networks operate. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6393.639999999999s)]
*  The mob bosses say go burn it down. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6396.32s)]
*  He just says, yeah, that guy's not paying. [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6397.88s)]
*  And they all wanna mount my head on the wall. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6400.16s)]
*  Like you've got that great deer mounted [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6403.599999999999s)]
*  on the wall over there. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6405.5599999999995s)]
*  They want Alex Jones' head on the wall [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6406.4s)]
*  as a symbol to scare everybody else. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6409.28s)]
*  I mean, they said that in the courthouses [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6411.599999999999s)]
*  and on the courthouse steps. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6413.36s)]
*  They said, send a message to everybody else, [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6414.24s)]
*  these patients zero. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6416.679999999999s)]
*  We're gonna take him off here. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6417.96s)]
*  Shut up and obey, yeah. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6418.8s)]
*  And destroy him and we're gonna scare every one [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6419.639999999999s)]
*  of these other Americans to keep them. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6422.2s)]
*  Literally, it's like in Bugs Life [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6424.16s)]
*  when the head grasshopper says, yeah, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6426.12s)]
*  we got all this grain, why are we gonna go beat up [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6427.88s)]
*  the ants because one little ant stood up. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6429.5599999999995s)]
*  And he goes, yeah, one little grain, doesn't hurt. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6431.04s)]
*  But he goes, but if they all stand up [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6433.28s)]
*  and he pulls it and it floods them. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6435.0s)]
*  He goes, if those little puny ants outnumber us 100 to one [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6436.719999999999s)]
*  and if they ever figure that out, it's over for us. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6440.08s)]
*  That's why we're going back to kill that ant. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6442.92s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6445.56s)]
*  That's it, so I'm just the ant in Bugs Life. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6446.4s)]
*  You are, but it hasn't worked. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6448.4400000000005s)]
*  And so I wanna make a prediction [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6450.36s)]
*  because I just wanna be on tape saying this. [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6452.16s)]
*  I'm gonna say it again even more clearly this time. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6454.12s)]
*  And of course, I hope I'm wrong, I pray I'm wrong. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6455.8s)]
*  But I do think a lot of the really crazy, bitter, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6457.96s)]
*  ethnic hate that you see on social media is fake. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6461.64s)]
*  It's, people were saying it don't mean it. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6465.0s)]
*  I think it's like, the Klansmen you'd see marching [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6468.72s)]
*  and you're like, there are no Klansmen. [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6472.0s)]
*  Like what? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6473.36s)]
*  And of course you find out that it's all, it's fake. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6474.2s)]
*  And it's designed to convince people [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6476.88s)]
*  that there's like a lot of roiling ethnic hatred [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6478.32s)]
*  that doesn't really exist. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6480.68s)]
*  And that's a predicate. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6481.6s)]
*  Patriot front. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6483.52s)]
*  Exactly, it's Charlottesville. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6484.4800000000005s)]
*  That's happening online right now. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6486.56s)]
*  And I know that it is. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6487.96s)]
*  And I think that at some point I pray I'm wrong, [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6489.84s)]
*  but there's gonna be an act of violence, [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6492.52s)]
*  ethnic inspired violence, of hate inspired violence, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6494.64s)]
*  actual hate, like killing people. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6498.0s)]
*  And I really hope I'm wrong. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6499.64s)]
*  But I feel like this is real. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6501.24s)]
*  And that event will be used to shut down [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6503.28s)]
*  free speech on social media. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6506.16s)]
*  I 100. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6507.679999999999s)]
*  Because that is the threat. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6508.8s)]
*  And you saw it with TikTok, like, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6510.04s)]
*  oh, we need to ban TikTok, just China owns it. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6511.48s)]
*  Nothing to do with China. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6514.2s)]
*  It had everything to do with opinions [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6515.5599999999995s)]
*  that the people in charge didn't like being expressed there. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6517.32s)]
*  And it's like, we're just gonna, [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6519.5199999999995s)]
*  and the Congress went along with it. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6520.36s)]
*  But if there's an act of violence [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6522.2s)]
*  and the innocents are murdered, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6523.76s)]
*  and I pray that doesn't happen, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6524.96s)]
*  because I hate that above all, but it has happened. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6526.28s)]
*  And I feel like it could happen again. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6528.639999999999s)]
*  And a lot of good people will go along with it. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6531.92s)]
*  Just like they went along with the censorship of you [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6534.72s)]
*  and the destruction of your life, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6537.32s)]
*  because they were told like, he's bad. [[01:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6538.96s)]
*  He had something to do with murdering children. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6540.96s)]
*  And then people just shut down. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6542.68s)]
*  They're like, I don't know. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6543.5599999999995s)]
*  Alex Jones is sending you with murdering children. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6545.96s)]
*  So whatever they do to Alex Jones, like, is fine. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6547.48s)]
*  And I can't tell you how many times [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6549.5199999999995s)]
*  in front of my family, people walk up and they go, [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6550.48s)]
*  you killed those kids. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6551.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6552.96s)]
*  And I'll always go, really? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6553.8s)]
*  I did, huh? [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6554.8s)]
*  And why am I walking around? [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6555.92s)]
*  And then just like, well, you know what you did. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6557.32s)]
*  But what you said is so important. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6560.32s)]
*  The last ingredients is the false flag [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6561.72s)]
*  on a big illegal alien demonstration or a black church. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6563.92s)]
*  Because the Democrats keep saying, [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6566.400000000001s)]
*  Trump's coming to kill the migrants. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6567.4400000000005s)]
*  We gotta rise up. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6569.08s)]
*  Yeah, or something else like that. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6569.96s)]
*  But where innocents are murdered by a crazy person, [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6571.6s)]
*  a crazy person, or maybe an actual crazy person used, [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6574.56s)]
*  or whatever, or maybe it just happens organically. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6576.84s)]
*  Maybe if you stoke enough ethnic division online, [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6578.76s)]
*  it's clearly bad. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6582.84s)]
*  I mean, there are people who have views that are, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6583.68s)]
*  are mad at other ethnicities. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6586.16s)]
*  I mean, that's real, okay? [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6587.4400000000005s)]
*  But there are also big actors who are not real. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6589.16s)]
*  They're doing it on purpose. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6593.16s)]
*  And we know who they are. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6594.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes, we do know who they are. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6595.84s)]
*  And for strategic reasons. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6597.72s)]
*  I'm not, I don't wanna get involved in all that filth, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6599.16s)]
*  but I- [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6602.12s)]
*  But let's just say we've seen the documents separately. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6602.96s)]
*  100%, and they're stoking this stuff, [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6604.72s)]
*  and maybe it just organically inspires someone [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6607.84s)]
*  to commit murder, a mass murder. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6610.04s)]
*  And again, I just pray, as someone who hates all violence, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6611.8s)]
*  to say it again, I pray that's not the case. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6614.639999999999s)]
*  But- [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6616.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, let's just say this. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6617.36s)]
*  The ones who are mainly attacking [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6618.22s)]
*  are the ones financing them. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6619.58s)]
*  It's the oldest trick in the book, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6620.9800000000005s)]
*  Hegelian dialectic. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6622.58s)]
*  And so just be aware of that, ladies and gentlemen. [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6623.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I just don't, yeah. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6626.42s)]
*  And I think you're what, [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6628.58s)]
*  and the only reason I bring that up [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6629.700000000001s)]
*  is because I worry about it every day. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6630.66s)]
*  I do too, because that's the next big move. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6632.5s)]
*  Free speech is the foundation of a free society. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6634.62s)]
*  Without it, it's not a free society. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6636.58s)]
*  You're a slave. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6637.9400000000005s)]
*  If you can't say what you think, you're a slave. [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6638.780000000001s)]
*  It's really simple. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6639.900000000001s)]
*  And we don't have slavery in this country. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6641.14s)]
*  It's a free country. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6642.42s)]
*  And when it happens, I pray it doesn't. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6643.26s)]
*  That's the next move. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6644.780000000001s)]
*  So we're predicting this, [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6645.820000000001s)]
*  so that there's enough eyes and ears on it [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6647.46s)]
*  and enough people watching so they don't pull it off. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6649.54s)]
*  Because that's the thing. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6651.46s)]
*  Everything I used to predict basically came true [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6652.46s)]
*  because the globalists were still in power. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6654.5s)]
*  They're so disorganized, have so many problems now. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6656.18s)]
*  A lot of times when we're able to get out ahead of things, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6659.3s)]
*  you and others, and Trump and Joe Rogan, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6661.08s)]
*  we're able, and Elon's, the huge voice, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6664.02s)]
*  second only to Trump, [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6667.38s)]
*  we're able to disrupt what they're doing [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6668.42s)]
*  and enough people see through it. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6670.86s)]
*  So if it does happen, [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6671.92s)]
*  they try to stampede us into blaming whoever it is. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6673.34s)]
*  Oh, the Crooks guy, he acted alone. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6676.38s)]
*  Well, this will be some right-wing Trump supporter [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6678.62s)]
*  with a MAGA hat. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6680.14s)]
*  100%. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6680.9800000000005s)]
*  He'll get killed by the SWAT team. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6681.8s)]
*  He was inspired by hate online. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6682.74s)]
*  Therefore, you're not allowed to have legitimate opinions [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6685.34s)]
*  or your own opinions. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6688.46s)]
*  And God can decide whether they're legitimate or not, [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6689.46s)]
*  but if you're a free man, a free person, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6692.02s)]
*  you have a right to say what you really believe, period. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6694.28s)]
*  And that cannot be encumbered or else you're a slave. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6696.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6699.64s)]
*  And we get back to the spiritual battle here. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6700.4800000000005s)]
*  I just want people to know that my lawyers just told me, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6704.7s)]
*  I put you on speaker with them, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6707.7s)]
*  they said I could be shut down within two days, two weeks. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6709.58s)]
*  They are coming to shut down in full force. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6711.58s)]
*  We've survived so much, like a long boxing match, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6713.34s)]
*  people are like, oh yeah, right. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6716.0199999999995s)]
*  No, this is very, very real. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6718.139999999999s)]
*  This has been very, very serious. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6719.82s)]
*  And so, for now, people can find me on exit reel, [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6721.62s)]
*  Alex Jones, but that part doesn't matter. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6723.86s)]
*  People understand more and more how things work. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6727.9s)]
*  All of your voices are so important. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6729.98s)]
*  All of you sharing this interview, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6731.62s)]
*  sharing the other great work Tucker's doing, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6733.92s)]
*  all the courage he has and others have [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6735.62s)]
*  to really put it all on the line. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6737.66s)]
*  You know, we haven't even talked about Iran. [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6738.98s)]
*  Well, give me your five minute. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6741.22s)]
*  I mean, that I should say, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6742.66s)]
*  I think this interview is going up tonight. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6743.94s)]
*  We're gonna try to get it up in a few hours, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6745.26s)]
*  but that's such a dynamic situation. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6747.0599999999995s)]
*  Steve Wicoff apparently is meeting directly [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6750.66s)]
*  with the Iranians, which I think is such a great, [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6752.18s)]
*  that's a blessing, and I hope for the best. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6754.54s)]
*  But give us your five minute overview. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6757.74s)]
*  Like, what is that and where is that going? [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6759.32s)]
*  Well, Iran's plan B for the globalist. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6762.5599999999995s)]
*  And Iran's got its issues and its Shiite militias [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6764.86s)]
*  and all that. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6767.719999999999s)]
*  I'm not lionizing the Mullahs. [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6768.5599999999995s)]
*  Oh, you're not? [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6771.04s)]
*  But they've been isolated. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6771.88s)]
*  Israel has knocked out their proxy forces [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6773.16s)]
*  in Lebanon and Gaza and in the West Bank. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6775.12s)]
*  And Netanyahu is extremely unpopular. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6778.759999999999s)]
*  He's been indicted. [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6783.32s)]
*  And he said he doesn't want an investigation [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6784.719999999999s)]
*  on January, he doesn't want an investigation [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6787.04s)]
*  of October 7th until the war is over. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6791.48s)]
*  But then he never, you know, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6795.0s)]
*  he's gonna have the war be over. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6796.56s)]
*  So I'm not even against Netanyahu. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6797.92s)]
*  I'm not against Israel. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6799.36s)]
*  I know most people in Israel don't work with Iran either. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6800.32s)]
*  But he's been trying to drag us into war since 9-11. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6802.72s)]
*  That's how long he's been around [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6807.2s)]
*  and in power off and on into this. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6808.12s)]
*  And they have the most ballistic missiles in the world. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6810.12s)]
*  What is four to one, five to one, six to one, [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6813.4s)]
*  to even the Israeli anti-missile defense system. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6816.72s)]
*  Israel, as you know, only has three big cities. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6820.68s)]
*  They will get blown off the map by this. [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6823.96s)]
*  Conventionally, even if Iran doesn't have nukes, [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6827.08s)]
*  it uses them, and the word is they do, [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6829.320000000001s)]
*  Israel will nuke Iran. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6832.0s)]
*  And then all hell's gonna break loose. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6835.0s)]
*  And in most scenarios, India and Pakistan [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6836.320000000001s)]
*  start nuking each other. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6838.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's got nukes. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6840.08s)]
*  There's a lot of other countries that have nukes [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6842.52s)]
*  that people don't know about. [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6843.96s)]
*  You don't want even a limited nuclear war [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6845.36s)]
*  because in most big threat assessment war games, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6847.5199999999995s)]
*  and Tucker's an expert on this, he can attest to it, [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6850.2s)]
*  he talks to the experts, it breaks out. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6852.08s)]
*  Kind of like your neighbor has the black plague. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6855.839999999999s)]
*  Well, you might get it. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6857.96s)]
*  Or your neighbor has got syphilis. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6859.679999999999s)]
*  God forbid you have sex with him. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6862.88s)]
*  I mean, this is a lot worse than syphilis. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6863.92s)]
*  This is a lot worse than TB. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6865.92s)]
*  This is really dangerous. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6867.48s)]
*  And Iran does have proxy forces in Europe [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6869.28s)]
*  and the United States that O'Biden let get in. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6872.56s)]
*  And they really do have some of these sleeper cells [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6875.8s)]
*  that are here. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6878.56s)]
*  This does go to full war. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6879.400000000001s)]
*  They can cause some major problems. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6880.22s)]
*  And different foreign intelligence agencies [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6881.280000000001s)]
*  are famous for spoofing Iranians [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6884.6s)]
*  in Saudi Arabian terror attacks. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6886.6s)]
*  They could easily stage a big false flag [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6888.92s)]
*  to get us into a war with Iran. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6890.92s)]
*  I'm aware, yeah. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6892.52s)]
*  And they're also, the Russians have warned, [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6893.76s)]
*  before they did, I warned, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6895.88s)]
*  the attacks on nuclear power plants in Ukraine and Russia [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6897.400000000001s)]
*  try to blame Russia. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6900.160000000001s)]
*  Ukraine's done that, been caught. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6901.2s)]
*  Ukraine and NATO tried to blame Russia [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6903.2s)]
*  for the Nord Stream pipeline. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6904.76s)]
*  How laughable is that? [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6905.66s)]
*  Of course, Syharsk's information has been proven [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6906.5s)]
*  that obviously it was the US government with NATO. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6908.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, hell even Biden said, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6910.72s)]
*  you know, we'll get rid of the pipeline if you invade. [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6911.8s)]
*  So the globalists are very reckless. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6913.8s)]
*  Again, 50% chance the Pentagon said [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6916.48s)]
*  that they started bombing Russia. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6918.4s)]
*  Russia would nuke. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6919.36s)]
*  They still rolled the dice. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6920.46s)]
*  So we need really cool heads here. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6921.96s)]
*  This is not like going into Iraq twice. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6925.44s)]
*  This is not like going into Libya. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6927.72s)]
*  This is not a cakewalk, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6929.96s)]
*  even for people that love to buy a bottle of bourbon [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6932.52s)]
*  and sit back and get drunk watching a war [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6935.0s)]
*  like so many sick people do. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6937.76s)]
*  This is the main threat to civilization. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6939.44s)]
*  And I mean, Tucker, you really have all the connections. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6943.28s)]
*  You travel the world. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6946.16s)]
*  You cover these summits. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6947.16s)]
*  I don't know anything other than I think the people [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6948.24s)]
*  in charge of a bunch of different countries [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6951.6s)]
*  are like reckless on a level that's [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6953.0s)]
*  without precedent in the modern era. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6955.88s)]
*  And I don't think they're serving their own people [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6957.52s)]
*  by the way, leaders like that. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6960.72s)]
*  It's not just like, you've got a bellicose leader [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6961.56s)]
*  who's threatening war or whatever. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6964.2s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily mean the people he rules [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6965.28s)]
*  are being served. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6968.4800000000005s)]
*  He's putting their lives at risk. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6969.32s)]
*  Our leaders have put our lives at risk for no good reason. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6970.400000000001s)]
*  And so, I'm hardly an expert in anything. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6972.96s)]
*  I'm just an observer and it's just all so obvious. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6975.96s)]
*  And I'm really worried about my last question to you is [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6978.84s)]
*  you get this sense that there's like a spirit of dullness [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6982.6s)]
*  or fantasy. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6986.24s)]
*  Maybe it's connected to living digitally or something. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6988.04s)]
*  But like smart, aware people are no longer smart or aware. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6991.04s)]
*  They're sort of sleepwalking through this [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6995.4s)]
*  incredibly dangerous moment [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=6997.92s)]
*  and they don't even acknowledge any of it. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7001.84s)]
*  And like, what is that? [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7005.28s)]
*  Well, that was the description I was gonna use. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7006.36s)]
*  There's like a mist that settles over all of us [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7007.96s)]
*  and like we can't, it's like no one is even like awake. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7010.44s)]
*  What is that? [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7014.84s)]
*  Well, that's how I describe it. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7016.64s)]
*  It's how you describe it. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7017.76s)]
*  We're sleepwalking into Armageddon. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7018.72s)]
*  The Bible calls it a spell. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7020.92s)]
*  It feels that way. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7023.360000000001s)]
*  Medically, they would call it a trance. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7024.200000000001s)]
*  And you know, since the advent, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7025.4400000000005s)]
*  I say that sarcastically of television [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7026.88s)]
*  and everybody gathering around it, [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7029.4400000000005s)]
*  people are way more highly suggestible. [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7031.280000000001s)]
*  Most people are closer to a near dream state [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7033.6s)]
*  or daydream state pretty much all the time. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7036.16s)]
*  It feels that way. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7038.12s)]
*  You go to a movie, you see everybody kind of drooling. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7038.96s)]
*  And I've never really had a lot of suspended disbelief. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7041.52s)]
*  When I was a kid, I was always analyzing things. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7044.88s)]
*  Me too, me too, me too. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7046.320000000001s)]
*  And so I guess that's a gift, [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7047.320000000001s)]
*  but also it's kind of torture. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7048.64s)]
*  It'd be fun to just be able to be mindless sometimes. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7049.64s)]
*  But yeah, and the establishment itself [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7052.24s)]
*  is all about never actually making a decision [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7055.08s)]
*  that you get in trouble for, [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7057.2s)]
*  having committees, having groups, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7058.16s)]
*  having a kind of policy where no one can be accountable. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7059.88s)]
*  But then that creates a runaway train scenario [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7063.16s)]
*  where then only the most reckless people [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7067.04s)]
*  that are the craziest kind of become the consensus [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7070.12s)]
*  because nobody else wants to challenge them. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7072.68s)]
*  And through Trump and Elon saying, [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7074.96s)]
*  hey, we don't want war, we don't want a meat grinder. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7077.280000000001s)]
*  This is too dangerous, this is crazy. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7079.200000000001s)]
*  We want to stabilize civilization. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7080.88s)]
*  We want to have more kids, not less. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7082.4800000000005s)]
*  Every actuary shows we collapse if we don't. [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7083.92s)]
*  Those are conscious. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7086.4800000000005s)]
*  Look at Trump, conscious, awake, sharp. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7087.84s)]
*  Elon, conscious, aware, sharp. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7089.64s)]
*  So many others. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7091.68s)]
*  And then it's a system of kind of quasi zombies and zombies [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7093.0s)]
*  run by a few kleptocrat, psycho, demon-possessed people [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7097.64s)]
*  that don't want us waking up the zombies. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7103.08s)]
*  So that's why they're mad at me. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7105.04s)]
*  It's why they're mad at Elon. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7106.12s)]
*  It's why they're mad at you. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7106.96s)]
*  Is that we are trying to collectively get people to wake up [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7108.8s)]
*  because the wheel on the ship is so heavy and so big, [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7111.8s)]
*  a few of us can't turn it. [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7115.0s)]
*  But if we get more people politically engaged and aware, [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7116.28s)]
*  together we're able to turn the wheel [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7119.04s)]
*  as we're about to go over this waterfall [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7121.5199999999995s)]
*  5,000 feet and get killed. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7123.5599999999995s)]
*  And so it's people that are dialed in and conscious [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7125.599999999999s)]
*  versus people that are unconscious in the middle [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7128.88s)]
*  versus evil that is driven by a very nihilistic, [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7130.96s)]
*  destructive force. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7134.4s)]
*  And that's what the transhumanism is about. [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7137.84s)]
*  I mean, I remember 30 years ago reading government [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7140.64s)]
*  white papers that were public, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7143.12s)]
*  that listeners sent me, medical people, [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7144.2s)]
*  that they had human-animal hybrids [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7146.16s)]
*  that could grow in cows for organ harvesting. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7148.32s)]
*  And of course that's been admitted for 20 years now, [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7150.92s)]
*  but just last week, hundreds of articles. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7154.28s)]
*  Oh, we can grow humanoids for organ harvesting. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7156.24s)]
*  Don't worry though. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7159.12s)]
*  They don't have consciousness. [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7160.12s)]
*  We've already raised them at undisclosed laboratories. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7161.36s)]
*  And then it's in the MIT reports that they've done it. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7165.36s)]
*  Or I remember 30 years ago, [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7168.92s)]
*  oh, military bases have goats that are part spider [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7170.16s)]
*  that produce body armor out of their milk, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7172.84s)]
*  but we don't show them to you. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7174.48s)]
*  And then later they brought them out. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7175.68s)]
*  And then, oh, we have dire wolves [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7177.24s)]
*  living in an undisclosed location [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7180.08s)]
*  where we spliced 13,000 year old DNA with a regular wolf. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7181.64s)]
*  And my point is the future has been here for a while. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7185.36s)]
*  And now there's specific facts [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7189.92s)]
*  that can be Scout computations [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7191.28s)]
*  association got into this, [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7193.400000000001s)]
*  and all of these Relax. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7194.56s)]
*  And Davis is holding on to that, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7196.04s)]
*  was a little grew up the company and Germaine. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7197.72s)]
*  And he's got 40 something base nickel mindset. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7199.400000000001s)]
*  As an adult, it needs secure technology, [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7202.08s)]
*  but ultimately it's not all about IT. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7204.72s)]
*  It's a very taboo. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7206.56s)]
*  It's all about how it works in theory. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7207.400000000001s)]
*  And Forest just got the law. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7209.68s)]
*  It's state law, it's part of science. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7210.56s)]
*  But all of these approaches are Imagination. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7212.28s)]
*  They stop people from reading. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7215.08s)]
*  And on the other hand, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7216.6s)]
*  became movies. Remember the 80s moon raker with with Roger Moore and remember there's a crazy [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7217.64s)]
*  billionaire with these other billionaires with the underground base in Brazil that's going to [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7225.56s)]
*  release a bio weapon on the earth to kill everybody but it only goes for a year. He's going to go up [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7229.4800000000005s)]
*  to space while everybody dies on earth at their space station and then come back and repopulate [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7234.280000000001s)]
*  the earth and he's a eugenicist and they only have the best specimens of the humans to do it. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7240.52s)]
*  And the movie Zardoz with Sean Connery in the 70s and Logan's Run and the island and THX 1138 [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7245.4800000000005s)]
*  and then you have Aldous Huxley who wrote Brave New World in 32. His brother Julian Huxley was the [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7255.4800000000005s)]
*  head of the World Eugenics Society. When that got a bad name in World War II they changed the World [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7262.6s)]
*  Transhumanist Society. He was the director general of UNESCO, really ran the UN and his brother before [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7266.52s)]
*  he died gave that famous Berkeley speech an hour long and I've read his book Brave New World [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7272.36s)]
*  Revisited that's non-fiction. Everybody should read it and he says no no no the world's not going to [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7276.28s)]
*  be like Orwell with the SWAT teams that's for the one percent that might resist. The real plan, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7281.639999999999s)]
*  the reason I could write Brave New World is this was the consensus of the elite in Europe and [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7286.5199999999995s)]
*  England of the world we're going to build with genetically engineered people, a subspecies that [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7292.04s)]
*  serves us, everyone taking soma, everyone's controlled and he explains in that Berkeley [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7296.92s)]
*  speech if you don't read the book he is a synopsis that this is a real plan that he saw being in place [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7302.12s)]
*  by 2020 and so you have to understand Brave New World is an instruction manual of what they want [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7308.4400000000005s)]
*  to do. They want to turn humans into a commodity that's why Obama calls it the end of history [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVaUsDzdq4E&t=7315.4s)]
