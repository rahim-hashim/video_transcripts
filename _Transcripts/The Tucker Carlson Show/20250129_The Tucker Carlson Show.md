# JFK Assassination Expert Reacts to Trump’s Effort to Declassify Files, and What You Should Expect
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM)
*  You first wrote about the JFK assassination for the Washington Post in the spring of 1995. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=0.0s)]
*  So that's 30 years of serious reporting on one topic, which is admittedly a vast topic, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=7.28s)]
*  but still one topic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=16.2s)]
*  What's it like to see this announcement? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=17.2s)]
*  I mean, those of us who've been calling for the release of these records for more than [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  This is a great and promising moment, but there's still pitfalls ahead. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=25.56s)]
*  And I want to emphasize that, you know, this is not something that can be done with the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=30.24s)]
*  stroke of a pen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=34.36s)]
*  The powers of these secret agencies are strong and we actually kind of see their influence [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=36.879999999999995s)]
*  even on Trump's statement. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=41.92s)]
*  So it's important to know, you know, what we've learned in the recent past, kind of [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  the context of these latest developments and, you know, what is possible under this order. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=48.6s)]
*  But a lot is now possible. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=54.92s)]
*  So that's a great development. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=56.82s)]
*  Thank you for saying that because it is complicated. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, a president can come in and say, as this president just did, I want to see the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=62.6s)]
*  documents and I want the public to see the documents. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=66.72s)]
*  But there's a distance between that and seeing the documents. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  So if you wouldn't mind walking us through what the process is for getting this material. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=72.2s)]
*  The president's order orders a plan within 15 days from four top officials, two of whom [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=78.44s)]
*  are acting and two of whom are Trump appointees, to come up with a plan for declassification. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  In the president's order, section three of the president's order contains a loophole, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  which to me could be interpreted as saying the CIA director could overrule any decision [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=97.39999999999999s)]
*  that comes out of this declassification effort. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  That's a pretty big loophole that needs to be plugged or, you know, disavowed because [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=106.86s)]
*  the agencies cannot have final control over the release of this material, right? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=112.86s)]
*  They've been resisting full disclosure since the day President Kennedy died. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=117.46s)]
*  That's the day that the CIA's lies began. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=122.22s)]
*  CIA officials began lying about what they knew about Lee Harvey Oswald within hours [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=125.18s)]
*  of President Kennedy's murder. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=130.14s)]
*  And they've been obfuscating, lying, deceiving, covering up, evading ever since. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=132.02s)]
*  So that kind of bureaucratic behavior, it's not going to stop just because President Trump [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=137.10000000000002s)]
*  said something on a piece of paper. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=142.58s)]
*  They are going to continue to fight a rearguard effort to prevent full disclosure of CIA records [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=144.36s)]
*  related to President Kennedy's assassination. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=150.36s)]
*  So we need to be vigilant. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=152.5s)]
*  We need to identify the documents are important and set some benchmarks to show is this effort [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=154.70000000000002s)]
*  really obtaining the results? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=161.10000000000002s)]
*  Is it really going to be successful at obtaining full JFK disclosure? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=162.66000000000003s)]
*  So you've got the perspective on this question. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=168.3s)]
*  How many times has the Congress, for example, or previous administrations called for disclosure [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=172.0s)]
*  of these documents? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=179.46s)]
*  This is not the first time. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=180.46s)]
*  No, the 1992 JFK Records Act passed unanimously by Congress. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=181.46s)]
*  Think of that, right? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  When's the last time Congress passed something unanimously? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  That law said that all JFK records had to be made public within 25 years, except in [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=192.7s)]
*  the rarest of circumstances. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=197.78s)]
*  That was the language. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=199.54s)]
*  So 25 years after 1992, 2017, that deadline arrived. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=200.54s)]
*  It came to President Trump and he caved into the CIA's demands for continuing secrecy. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=206.62s)]
*  So that was a very clear expression of the will of the people and the will of Congress. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=213.29999999999998s)]
*  They've just blown the deadline. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=218.66s)]
*  They don't really care to be seen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=220.57999999999998s)]
*  They don't care that people see them violating the law around JFK records. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=223.26s)]
*  Yes, clearly they don't. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=226.98s)]
*  And they violated even more basic law when they apparently participated in the murder [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=228.82s)]
*  of a sitting president. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=234.45999999999998s)]
*  So I mean, these are lawless agencies, obviously. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=235.5s)]
*  But where are these documents? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=239.34s)]
*  Do you have any idea? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=240.82s)]
*  So well, there's two places. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=242.06s)]
*  There's 3600 plus documents that are held by the National Archives that contain redactions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=244.46s)]
*  Those are in the possession. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=251.58s)]
*  Those documents should be very easy to review and release quickly if they're serious about [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=253.34s)]
*  declassification and full disclosure. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=258.98s)]
*  So then those records were identified by the JFK Assassination Review Board in the 1990s, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=262.26s)]
*  which did a great job of obtaining and declassifying a million pages of JFK records. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=269.5s)]
*  So we've had a huge advance in historical knowledge since the 1990s. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=274.42s)]
*  And what that showed us was the existence of other JFK records that the Review Board [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=279.5s)]
*  never knew about, often because the CIA deceived them. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=286.1s)]
*  So we need a capacity to get those records that are in the National Archives right now. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=290.46000000000004s)]
*  But we also need to go out and get the records that are known to exist that are not yet in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=296.1s)]
*  that collection. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=299.98s)]
*  So there's two big bodies of records that are out there, and a serious declassification [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=301.78s)]
*  effort will get both of them. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=306.14s)]
*  And I'm assuming that the second set that you refer to are at the CIA? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=310.85999999999996s)]
*  CIA and FBI, yes, and other agencies too. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=315.61999999999995s)]
*  Will we know whether we've received the entire corpus or not? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=322.11999999999995s)]
*  When we start seeing documents, it's pretty easy to establish some benchmarks about what [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=326.78000000000003s)]
*  are the most important records. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  And we will see in both categories have those documents come into the record. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=335.70000000000005s)]
*  So if we monitor the process, we should be able to say, is this serious or not? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=341.90000000000003s)]
*  I think that the president has ordered a plan in 15 days. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=348.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't think that means we're going to get documents in 15 days. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=354.58000000000004s)]
*  But if we don't get documents within 30 days of the plan, then you've got to start saying [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=359.02000000000004s)]
*  this thing has gone off the rails. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=364.7s)]
*  Well, but it's kind of abrupt. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=368.38s)]
*  It's only been 62 years. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  Maybe they haven't had time to prepare everything. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=374.5s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=377.02000000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=379.26s)]
*  What's your guess as to why they're holding so tightly? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=381.82s)]
*  And I can just say, I'm sure you know this, but as of last month, there was pressure in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=384.5s)]
*  Washington to appoint or not appoint certain people based on the likelihood they would [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=390.5s)]
*  push for declassification of these documents. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=394.86s)]
*  In other words, there are federal bureaucrats right now for whom withholding these documents [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=396.78s)]
*  is a high priority. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=402.1s)]
*  I just think that's amazing. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=403.1s)]
*  What do you think that is? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=404.78s)]
*  I think the only explanation is that the CIA has something to hide and they'd rather be [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=406.94s)]
*  seen as defying the law than releasing the information. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=411.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, that tells you something right there. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=414.78000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, we can go into the specifics of some of the key documents that are out [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=418.06s)]
*  there that that are important to be to be produced soon. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=424.3s)]
*  And but until that happens, you know, we can't be sure that it's going to happen. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  Millions of Americans are still clinging to their New Year's resolutions, but some goals [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=436.22s)]
*  transcend the flipping of the calendar. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=439.74s)]
*  Being prepared should always be a goal. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=442.34s)]
*  When a crisis hits, the last thing you want is to be scrambling for something basic like [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=445.65999999999997s)]
*  medication. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=449.82s)]
*  And that's why the JACE case changes the game. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=451.3s)]
*  The JACE case is your personal emergency supply of life saving medications, antibiotics, critical [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=454.14s)]
*  prescriptions, things you're actually going to need when pharmacies are not available. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=459.7s)]
*  The JACE case's protection is totally necessary. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=464.18s)]
*  So as you're planning for the rest of this year, make emergency preparedness a top priority. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=467.94s)]
*  We don't know what's coming next. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=472.58s)]
*  We do know preparation beats panic every single time. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=474.02s)]
*  So with the JACE case, you'll have peace of mind knowing that you are ready for whatever [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=477.09999999999997s)]
*  happens. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=480.62s)]
*  Go to JACEcase.com, enter the code TUCKER to make sure you have the right meds on hand [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=481.62s)]
*  when you need them, which is usually the moment when you can't get them. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=486.53999999999996s)]
*  JACE. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=490.97999999999996s)]
*  I mean, not knowing much about the process, but just employing common sense, you'd think, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=491.97999999999996s)]
*  you know, 62 years you've had time to scrub the stuff that's incriminating. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=497.94s)]
*  Are we confident that these documents still exist? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=501.73999999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=504.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, the documents that I'm talking about in the National Archives collection, I mean, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  they're in the possession of National Archives today. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=509.97999999999996s)]
*  They could go get them this afternoon. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=512.28s)]
*  The documents that are not yet in the collection, those are known to exist and I mean, known [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=514.86s)]
*  to exist, you know, as of recently. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=520.74s)]
*  So, you know, if they're not produced, if we find evidence they've been destroyed, then [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=523.54s)]
*  we have pretty good evidence that, you know, that the cover up is continuing. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=528.3399999999999s)]
*  But these are documents that are known to exist. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=531.66s)]
*  This isn't a phishing expedition. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=534.42s)]
*  This is a search for JFK records that have not been put on the public record by the CIA [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=536.66s)]
*  and the FBI. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=542.3s)]
*  But whose existence has been verified. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=544.06s)]
*  So it's not like it's up to the current leadership of the CIA to define what the documents are. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=545.9s)]
*  We know what the documents are. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=552.1s)]
*  It's a matter of them handing them over. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=553.26s)]
*  And if they don't hand them over, it'll be because the new CIA director, John Ratcliffe, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=557.0600000000001s)]
*  has said, I don't want to hand them over. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=561.98s)]
*  And we'll know that. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=563.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=564.46s)]
*  And you know, it was interesting to me that in Ratcliffe's confirmation hearings, he was [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=565.46s)]
*  not asked about JFK files, which makes me think that it's not a priority of Tom Cotton [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=568.82s)]
*  and the Senate Intelligence Committee. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=575.0600000000001s)]
*  It seemed like they were staying away from the subject, you know, which, like you noted, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=577.12s)]
*  had been central to the idea that Amaryllis Foxx might take a job at the CIA to oversee [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=582.36s)]
*  this. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=587.12s)]
*  You know, so, you know, there's got to be a commitment from Ratcliffe to make sure that [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=588.12s)]
*  this happens. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=593.24s)]
*  And I don't think that he's ever said anything by JFK files. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=594.24s)]
*  You may know differently, but I've never seen anything. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=597.24s)]
*  So he has no position as far as I can tell. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=599.64s)]
*  No. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=602.4s)]
*  He is a loyal Trump guy. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=603.68s)]
*  And Trump has been talking about this for years. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=607.3199999999999s)]
*  Trump is bitter that he was talked out of releasing those files by Mike Pompeo, former [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=610.16s)]
*  CIA director under him. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=617.6s)]
*  He's mad about that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=619.02s)]
*  He said that in public. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=620.02s)]
*  And so, you know, it's hard for me to believe that Ratcliffe would withhold, you know, especially [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=621.4s)]
*  something that we know exists. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=627.4s)]
*  I just don't see that happening. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=628.8s)]
*  So you're aware of the Amaryllis Foxx-Kennedy behind the scenes. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=630.92s)]
*  So will you tell us what you know about that? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=636.92s)]
*  Well, it's just, you know, I know from the news reports that RFK Jr. floated the idea [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=638.68s)]
*  of having her go to CIA and kind of oversee the process to get to the bottom of the JFK [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=644.24s)]
*  assassination, was the quote that I saw. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=650.64s)]
*  So, you know, you need to have a bureaucratic point person to ride herd on this because [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=652.88s)]
*  the agencies are going to be very reluctant. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=657.88s)]
*  So that's a good idea. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=659.94s)]
*  You know, whether it's her, I mean, a former CIA officer, that's somebody who would be [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=661.58s)]
*  qualified, who knows that building and would be able to do that. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=665.46s)]
*  Somebody else could do it as well. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=669.5s)]
*  But you are going to need a point person. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=672.1800000000001s)]
*  The way it's set up now, it looks like NSC advisor Mike Walls will probably be the point [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=674.5200000000001s)]
*  person along with the attorney general. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=681.62s)]
*  So as that takes shape, you know, that's a key thing is what's the real commitment [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=685.5s)]
*  to ride herd on this as opposed to just issue a piece of paper and then let the bureaucracy [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=690.94s)]
*  do what it does. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=697.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=699.1s)]
*  It seems like it's going to be kind of hard to get out of it. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=700.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=703.98s)]
*  Because there are informed people like, like, and especially you paying attention. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=704.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=709.82s)]
*  I'm a little less confident on the Martin Luther King assassination files. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=710.9000000000001s)]
*  And I think of all of these crimes, there are three, there's the murder of Bobby Kennedy, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=716.22s)]
*  the murder of JFK, the murder of MLK. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=720.5400000000001s)]
*  I think that story is the official story is the least plausible. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=722.7s)]
*  I mean, it's actually ridiculous that he was murdered by a prison inmate acting alone, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=726.9000000000001s)]
*  but some without a job. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=732.98s)]
*  But somehow that prison inmate winds up going to Canada, then the UK, then is heading to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=734.0600000000001s)]
*  South Africa with two forged foreign passports. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=738.82s)]
*  And he did that all by himself. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=741.62s)]
*  Like that's just, I mean, come on. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=743.58s)]
*  And so clearly there was a conspiracy to murder Martin Luther King. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=745.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't think any normal person thinks otherwise. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=748.3000000000001s)]
*  And certainly those the details. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=752.1s)]
*  So are we going to find, like, what do you think we're going to find there? [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=753.58s)]
*  You know, I don't know those records as well. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=757.5s)]
*  But the fact that they're secret, I mean, you know, we don't need to argue about the [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=760.2600000000001s)]
*  conclusions. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=764.9000000000001s)]
*  The point is we need the records and then we can have an informed debate. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=766.06s)]
*  But right now we have no informed debate, especially about MLK, but even about JFK and [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=770.86s)]
*  RFK. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=776.6999999999999s)]
*  We don't have all the records. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=777.6999999999999s)]
*  So you know, it's the CIA is very good and its allies in the establishment media are [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=778.86s)]
*  very good at changing the subject and getting us to argue about things that are not really [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=785.92s)]
*  germane. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=791.9399999999999s)]
*  The point is the law is very clear. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=792.9399999999999s)]
*  The CIA has blown the deadline and this material should be made public. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=794.88s)]
*  All of it. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=798.92s)]
*  If it's trivial, so be it. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=799.92s)]
*  You know, I'm not saying I'm right about how I interpret these records. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=801.72s)]
*  Put it out there and you can decide if I'm right. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=805.76s)]
*  That's right. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=808.4399999999999s)]
*  What are the chances that we get full disclosure in the next month or two or what seems like [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=809.4399999999999s)]
*  full disclosure and every media story says, see, there's nothing there? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=815.98s)]
*  If we get the documents that I'm talking about, that will not be a credible narrative. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=820.84s)]
*  And let me cite a couple of examples, Tucker, because this isn't a fishing expedition. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=827.1s)]
*  OK, so in one of the key documents that's still redacted, unbelievably in my view, is [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=832.12s)]
*  a memo that Arthur Schlesinger wrote to JFK after the Bay of Pigs. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=838.9200000000001s)]
*  Kennedy was very disillusioned with the CIA. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=843.4s)]
*  He felt they were trying to dictate policy to him. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=845.5400000000001s)]
*  And he talked about reorganizing the CIA in the words that are often quoted, breaking [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=849.16s)]
*  up the CIA and scattering it to the winds. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=854.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=857.16s)]
*  So this was actually a concrete expression of that impulse. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=858.16s)]
*  We need to do something about an agency that's out of control. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=861.12s)]
*  Arthur Schlesinger writes up his thoughts. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=864.8s)]
*  He's got a security clearance, does a very careful study of CIA operations. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=867.4s)]
*  In that memo to Kennedy, there is still almost an entire page redacted. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=871.8399999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  So the CIA is censoring criticism of itself by the White House. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=878.44s)]
*  And we're not allowed to see that 61 years later. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  So Schlesinger's memo, it's not about the events that happened in Dallas. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=887.32s)]
*  It's about the alienation of Kennedy and the CIA. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=892.02s)]
*  That's a very basic test. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=896.52s)]
*  If we don't get that document, the whole thing's a joke. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=898.4000000000001s)]
*  OK, it's that simple. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=901.36s)]
*  But is it legal to criticize the CIA still? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=903.1600000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what this document, it raises the question, right? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=907.28s)]
*  If somebody knows the contents of that censored page and came to me and said, Jeff, I'll tell [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=911.04s)]
*  you what's in there. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=917.84s)]
*  Under the law right now, they would be taking a certain legal risk. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=919.8s)]
*  But that's a fact. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=923.92s)]
*  And when a JFK whistleblower approached me a couple of years ago, and I wrote about this [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=926.04s)]
*  on JFK Facts last year, you know, he described to me a secret CIA facility in northern Virginia [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=930.5200000000001s)]
*  where he had worked as a contractor. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=938.2s)]
*  And he said, there's a JFK archive in there. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=941.44s)]
*  He had seen it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=943.74s)]
*  He had talked to the people, to the woman who ran it, who controlled access to it. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=944.74s)]
*  He saw what was on the on the shelves there. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=948.6s)]
*  So you know, that guy, it was risky for him to talk to me. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=952.2800000000001s)]
*  And it took a long time for me to convince him to come forward. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=959.0s)]
*  And he only came forward after a couple of years when he realized nothing was happening. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=961.88s)]
*  You know, there was no prospect of the CIA coming clean. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=967.32s)]
*  So that's important. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=971.84s)]
*  I'll tell you something else that's good about President Trump's order. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=972.84s)]
*  I think it makes it easier for any whistleblowers to come forward. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=976.96s)]
*  And I'd like to say if there are people out there who have access to classified information, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=981.36s)]
*  consult your lawyer. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=987.0s)]
*  But I think President Trump's order effectively, well, it reduces their risk about talking [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=988.0s)]
*  about things that are classified because the president's saying we want all of this out. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=993.6800000000001s)]
*  That carries some weight. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=997.96s)]
*  So that in itself is an important development. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=999.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, when I reported something about the contents of the JFK files two years ago and [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  Mike Pompeo's lawyer called me the next day to threaten me. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1011.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was an amazing story. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1013.5600000000001s)]
*  And it goes to show you that, you know, talking about this stuff, you can be threatened with [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1016.6s)]
*  legal action. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1022.12s)]
*  That's still possible. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1023.4s)]
*  You know, so that threat needs to be removed. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1024.6399999999999s)]
*  And I hope the president's order has done that, you know, and that people can feel that [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1027.6s)]
*  this is perfectly legitimate to talk about. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1032.12s)]
*  There are no real national security concerns in this material, except for the fact that [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1034.44s)]
*  the assassination of a president is a national security concern. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1040.2s)]
*  Right? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1043.8s)]
*  Well, sure. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1044.96s)]
*  But I mean, if you think that the public's trust in the CIA is a national security imperative, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1045.96s)]
*  in other words, if people doubt us, Americans will die. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1051.56s)]
*  I mean, I think that's what they tell themselves, you know, that preserving myths about their [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1054.96s)]
*  agency are like, you know, like a legitimate goal of government. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1060.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1065.8799999999999s)]
*  And so, you know, crazy. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1068.52s)]
*  Another story which I reported on JFK Facts last year. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1069.76s)]
*  Before President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, the CIA had Lee Harvey Oswald [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1074.32s)]
*  under surveillance for four years. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1080.28s)]
*  By November 21st, 1963, they had compiled 180 pages of material on Oswald, his personal [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1083.6s)]
*  life, his political beliefs, his contact with a KGB officer, his arrest. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1091.08s)]
*  They had all of that at the time Kennedy was leaving for Dallas. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1096.24s)]
*  CIA counterintelligence chief James Engleton knew that Oswald was in the Dallas area in [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1100.8s)]
*  the first week of November of 1963. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1107.08s)]
*  That pre-assassination Oswald file was not completely declassified until April 2023. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1110.4s)]
*  That's how sensitive this is. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1117.92s)]
*  And they're very good at keeping this stuff off the public record. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1120.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, now when you go to people in the mainstream media, they won't report on Oswald's [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1123.96s)]
*  pre-assassination file. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1130.52s)]
*  They'll say, oh, they were just covering their assets. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1131.52s)]
*  They make excuses for the CIA instead of saying, hey, you had 180 pages on the guy? [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1134.32s)]
*  You know, was that extreme negligence, intentional negligence or actual complicity? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1140.32s)]
*  You know, and we don't know. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1145.68s)]
*  But that file is the pre-assassination Oswald file is one of the most significant things [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1147.8s)]
*  to come out in recent years, for sure. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1152.76s)]
*  So was that given over to the investigators on the Warren Commission? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1156.04s)]
*  No. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1160.52s)]
*  When the Warren Commission interviewed CIA director John McCone and Deputy Director Richard [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1161.52s)]
*  Helms behind closed doors, only Warren Commission members there were Alan Dulles and Gerald [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1167.8799999999999s)]
*  Ford and John Sherman Cooper was there for a little bit. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1175.24s)]
*  They lied. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1180.48s)]
*  They committed perjury, especially Helms, and said we didn't have any information about [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1181.64s)]
*  Oswald before the assassination. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1188.64s)]
*  Minimal information. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1189.84s)]
*  That was the line. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1191.4s)]
*  So in their mind, 180 page file on Oswald, that was minimal information. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1192.08s)]
*  Pay no attention and don't hold us accountable for missing the fact that this guy killed [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1198.64s)]
*  the president. We're sorry, Mrs. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1203.96s)]
*  Kennedy, but that's just the way life is. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1205.64s)]
*  That's their attitude. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1208.08s)]
*  It's bland arrogance. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1209.32s)]
*  And we see it to this day. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1211.6s)]
*  I want to tell you about an amazing documentary series from our friend, Sean Stone, called [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1213.8799999999999s)]
*  All the President's Men, the Conspiracy Against Trump. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1218.8s)]
*  It is a series of interviews with people at the very heart of the first Trump term, many [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1221.6799999999998s)]
*  of whom are close to the heart of the second Trump term. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1227.8s)]
*  This is their stories about what permanent Washington tried to do to them, in many cases, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1231.32s)]
*  send them to prison for the crime of supporting Donald Trump. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1236.08s)]
*  Their words have never been more relevant than they are now. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1239.04s)]
*  Steve Bannon, Cash Patel, I'm in there even. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1241.84s)]
*  All the President's Men, the Conspiracy Against Trump. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1244.12s)]
*  And you will find it only on TCNTuckerCarlson.com. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1247.12s)]
*  Highly recommended. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1250.56s)]
*  What do you suppose is still being classified from the investigation to Robert F. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1262.36s)]
*  Kennedy's death? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1267.52s)]
*  You know, I wrote a book about James Angleton, the counterintelligence chief who ran the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1269.48s)]
*  Oswald, who held the Oswald file from 1959 to 1963. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1274.92s)]
*  Angleton told the church committee kind of off the record that he believed RFK had been [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1281.72s)]
*  killed by organized crime figures. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1286.6399999999999s)]
*  So there's the body of records from the L.A. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1290.04s)]
*  Police Department. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1293.3999999999999s)]
*  The CIA had people in the LAPD who helped control the investigation, the assassination [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1294.84s)]
*  and exclude marginalized witnesses who didn't say what the government wanted said. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1300.9599999999998s)]
*  The RFK documents are a problem because they're not in one place and it will take a little [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1307.6799999999998s)]
*  bit of effort to collect them. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1315.08s)]
*  And it's good that the president wrote in 45 days, not 15 days for those documents, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1317.08s)]
*  because it's going to take a little more work. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1321.64s)]
*  That's a reasonable delay in light of, you know, getting, you know, getting, finding [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1323.72s)]
*  and getting and releasing those documents. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1329.2s)]
*  Do you think how would you assess the likelihood that the murder of Bobby Kennedy was not [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1333.8400000000001s)]
*  what they told us it was? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1340.2800000000002s)]
*  A lone nutcase called Sirhan Sirhan shooting him with a 22 in the kitchen in the [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1341.8400000000001s)]
*  Ambassador Hotel. You think there's more there? [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1346.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you have you have the testimony of the coroner who was hyper aware that the [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1349.08s)]
*  JFK autopsy was a joke and a fraud. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1355.76s)]
*  And Dr. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1359.52s)]
*  Noguchi said that Kennedy's head wound was a contact wound, that the gun had been close [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1360.44s)]
*  to Kennedy's head when the shot was fired. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1366.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, Sirhan Sirhan was never that close to RFK. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1369.68s)]
*  So that alone is kind of indisputable factual evidence of a deficiency at a minimum in [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1373.4s)]
*  the official story. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1380.12s)]
*  So also, I think, you know, in the long and I'm not an expert on our case assassination, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1382.48s)]
*  but when you see how CIA assassination operations worked and the kind of techniques that [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1387.36s)]
*  they use, you can't rule out that Sirhan was under some kind of, you know, mind control [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1393.04s)]
*  program. I mean, they had a mind control program and it was designed to do things like [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1400.44s)]
*  this. Commit an act and you have no memory of it. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1404.76s)]
*  So we know they were working on that technology. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1407.8s)]
*  Could it have been applied here? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1410.76s)]
*  That's why we need the records so that we can assess is that a real possibility? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1412.3600000000001s)]
*  Sirhan Sirhan is in his 80s now. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1417.28s)]
*  He's still in prison. He's still alive. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1419.0800000000002s)]
*  And the one part of his story that's never changed and it seems credible to me is that he [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1421.52s)]
*  has no memory of of shooting Bobby Kennedy. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1426.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's a striking detail. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1430.44s)]
*  Yeah, I would say you maintain the same story for, you know, almost 60 years. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1433.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think it has a little bit more credibility. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1439.16s)]
*  Final question. Thank you for taking this time. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1442.48s)]
*  Did since you've been working on this for so long and you did come out of, you know, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1444.1200000000001s)]
*  the most prominent of the mainstream media, the Washington Post. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1450.72s)]
*  Have you been slandered as a nutcase conspiracy theorist? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1455.24s)]
*  I was wondered, like, what do they do with you exactly? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1460.52s)]
*  Because you're not coming from the fringes. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1462.76s)]
*  You're coming from the right from the middle of the establishment. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1464.0800000000002s)]
*  I mean, you know, you've been attacked. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1467.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, the problem that they have is that I don't have a conspiracy theory. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1469.64s)]
*  So the label of conspiracy theorist just doesn't apply. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  And the other thing is, you know, nobody can deny the stuff that I'm talking about. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1476.8400000000001s)]
*  Let me mention another JFK document that's very important and I think will interest you. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1481.1599999999999s)]
*  One of the things that's test that's withheld and is in the JFK collection right now [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1485.9599999999998s)]
*  is the testimony of James Angleton in 1975 to the church committee about [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1490.84s)]
*  the Israeli nuclear program. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1496.2399999999998s)]
*  This is a hundred and thirteen page document and it's heavily redacted to this day. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1498.84s)]
*  And the redactions clearly pertain to Israel. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1504.1599999999999s)]
*  Now, is this an assassination related document? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1508.1999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. The Assassination Records Review Board said this is an assassination [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1510.72s)]
*  related document. It meets the statutory definition. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1515.16s)]
*  OK, if the president and this effort are serious, that testimony will be [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1518.28s)]
*  declassified because Angleton controlled the Oswald file on the one hand, and he was [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1524.28s)]
*  a contact with the Israelis on the other. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1529.68s)]
*  So it belongs in the public record. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1531.88s)]
*  That's another test of is this serious effort. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1534.8s)]
*  So let me ask you why in the world with the Demona project, the Israeli nuclear [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1539.12s)]
*  program, which has never officially been admitted by anybody but Israel, what would [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1546.12s)]
*  that conceivably have to do with the assassination of JFK? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1551.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, it relates to what Angleton was doing in 1963. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1557.6s)]
*  OK, there were profound conflicts between Israel and the Kennedy White House over the [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1563.0400000000002s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1569.44s)]
*  Kennedy was pressing for on-site inspections, which the Israelis resisted because [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1570.92s)]
*  on-site inspections would have realized that they had a bomb making program. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1576.6000000000001s)]
*  So this was a real bone of contention between the Israeli government and the Kennedy [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1581.0400000000002s)]
*  administration in the summer of 1963, at a time when Angleton controlled the Oswald [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1585.4s)]
*  file. So just the juxtaposition of those facts means that everything about it should [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1591.12s)]
*  be on the public record. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1596.84s)]
*  And Angleton, who is the counterintel chief at CIA, James Jesus Angleton, he [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1599.04s)]
*  that's quite amazing. Did he support do you know his view of the Israeli nuclear [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1609.6399999999999s)]
*  program? I mean, it's very hard to tell sometimes from this testimony, given all [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1614.1999999999998s)]
*  the redactions. But yeah, that's you know, was he secretly supporting Israel against [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1619.72s)]
*  JFK? That's one of the questions that that needs to be answered by full disclosure. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1625.16s)]
*  So why would he be asked about that in a congressional hearing? [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1631.48s)]
*  That's quite amazing. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1635.6000000000001s)]
*  Well, because in in 1975, the CIA had been revealed to be running assassination [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1636.84s)]
*  programs, to be running a mind control program, to be spying on the anti-war [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1643.6000000000001s)]
*  movement, spying on Americans. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1648.76s)]
*  So, you know, he was hauled before and Congress, who was completely in the dark, had [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1650.3200000000002s)]
*  been duped or wanted to be duped. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1656.2s)]
*  You know, suddenly their eyes woke up and they had to explain to their constituents, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1658.24s)]
*  hey, what have these guys been doing in our name? [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1662.6000000000001s)]
*  And so Angleton was called in and this was all, you know, executive session testimony. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1664.88s)]
*  So he was grilled about lots of things about domestic spying, about the Israeli nuclear [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1669.88s)]
*  program, about the JFK assassination. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1675.0800000000002s)]
*  Interestingly enough, he was not questioned about Oswald because even the Church [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1677.8s)]
*  Committee did not know the extent of the pre-assassination surveillance of Oswald. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1682.52s)]
*  That's only something we've learned since the 1990s. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1686.92s)]
*  It's it is interesting. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1690.68s)]
*  I mean, I have no idea what the truth is, of course, but it is interesting that one [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1691.96s)]
*  of the only major policy changes that Lyndon Johnson made in the year after the [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1696.52s)]
*  president's murder was on the Israeli nuclear program, which he accepted. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1704.52s)]
*  Yeah, basically, he dropped the demand for on-site inspections. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1709.92s)]
*  He dropped the demand that the APAC be classified as a domestic lobby. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1713.92s)]
*  And, you know, there was really no accountability after that. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1719.8799999999999s)]
*  And the story only emerged, you know, ten years later when the Church Committee started [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1723.68s)]
*  pressing Angleton for some explanations. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1729.32s)]
*  So I had I had no idea until you just told me that that was actually a feature of those [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1732.28s)]
*  hearings. And so, of course, I mean, the public has the American public has an absolute [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1736.84s)]
*  right to know what's in that exchange 50 years later. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1741.28s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, and this is a tough call for for for the president because he's [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1745.9199999999998s)]
*  going to get very strong pushback from his national security apparatus, supported by [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1751.76s)]
*  the CIA, supported by Israeli interests to say, no, you can't talk about that. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1757.1999999999998s)]
*  That's not permitted. You know, you can't don't do that. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1762.32s)]
*  It's just it's frustrating as an American citizen. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1766.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't I don't have any kind of real agenda here other than it's my country. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1770.0s)]
*  I'm a shareholder in America, as are you. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  And I think we have an absolute moral right and a legal right to know to know this 50 [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1776.9199999999998s)]
*  years later. So I well, I really appreciate that. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1782.84s)]
*  You're taking all this time, Jefferson Morley. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1787.0s)]
*  And I hope you don't mind if if we check in with you, you know, to see if you know, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1789.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, fulfilled. Like I say, there's some very clear benchmarks to figure out is this [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1793.76s)]
*  working or not. And, you know, are people holding up the process and and obstructing [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1798.6799999999998s)]
*  the president's wishes or are they, you know, are they really going along? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1803.72s)]
*  And so the proof is in the pudding. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1808.04s)]
*  You know, the president's sentiment is great. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1810.1999999999998s)]
*  It's great that a president has committed to this. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1812.72s)]
*  It's amazing that no president has committed in this way before, but we'll take it. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1814.72s)]
*  I'm not I'm not a supporter of President Trump. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1819.64s)]
*  But on this issue, he's absolutely right. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1822.4s)]
*  And we need to follow through on what he said. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1825.0s)]
*  Amazing. Thank you very much. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1828.44s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. Let's talk again. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1830.48s)]
*  Thank you. So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1832.96s)]
*  It's not surprising. That's what they do. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1841.68s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the world right [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1843.48s)]
*  now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars on the [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1846.92s)]
*  cusp of fighting right now. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1851.8400000000001s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1853.72s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1858.0800000000002s)]
*  It's immoral. What can you do about it? [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1863.0s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1864.44s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google or we could find a way around it, a way that you could [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1865.6000000000001s)]
*  actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1868.92s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our channel. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1873.0s)]
*  Subscribe. Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1876.52s)]

*  information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d26YE2datFM&t=1885.96s)]
