*  How'd you get into this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=0.68s)]
*  Into the Navy? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2.14s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3.4s)]
*  It was one of those things where, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5.28s)]
*  a time in life where it's just time to leave town. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7.72s)]
*  If you ever wanna make God laugh, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=10.24s)]
*  tell him your plan for life and then something changes. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=11.76s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=14.08s)]
*  And it's even like going up to Bin Laden's bedroom, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=14.92s)]
*  it was never planned to be that way, it just happened. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Like life happens around you as you're planning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=18.6s)]
*  I joined the Navy, it was time to leave town. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  I had a bad relationship with a girl. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=23.48s)]
*  My plan in life was college basketball, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=25.48s)]
*  MBA and then work with my dad as a broker. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=28.32s)]
*  And I had a bad relationship, I got dumped [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  and it's like, I gotta leave and the easiest way [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=33.4s)]
*  out of Butte, Montana is to join the Marine Corps. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=35.72s)]
*  Butte is not the same as Bozeman. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=37.64s)]
*  No, no. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=39.64s)]
*  I don't think people understand that. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  Bozeman is beautiful, it's got Yellowstone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=43.64s)]
*  Even though Yellowstone's in Wyoming, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=46.6s)]
*  the show made everyone go to Bozeman. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=49.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Bozeman's beautiful, there's great food, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=51.32s)]
*  really good coffee, in Butte, Montana, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=52.68000000000001s)]
*  you will get your ass whooped. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  Like it's a mining town. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=55.64s)]
*  And they're proud of that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=56.68s)]
*  The biggest, I think it was the biggest. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=59.44s)]
*  Yeah, it was, yeah. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=61.32s)]
*  I think it got electricity before Chicago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=62.32s)]
*  And it still has the oldest Chinese restaurant [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=65.4s)]
*  in the country, the Peking. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=68.12s)]
*  And this is funny, so the guy that owned it, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=70.56s)]
*  his name was Danny Wong, his son Jerry Tam owns it now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=72.92s)]
*  Best Chinese, you only need a menu, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  you go in there and they just serve you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=77.68s)]
*  But after Danny Wong, they named the street [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=79.64s)]
*  behind it after him. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  And I don't know why, but they named it Danny Wong Way. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=82.88s)]
*  Wong Way? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=85.44s)]
*  It's like, are you messing with him after his death? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=87.08000000000001s)]
*  We too low. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  ["Way to Go"] [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=91.64s)]
*  But yeah, it's just a wonderful town, really good food. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=111.84s)]
*  And they don't quite realize how good the food is there, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=114.64s)]
*  how good life is there. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  Like I have friends back home that, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  cause I have an odd job now, I'm not really sure what I do, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=120.36s)]
*  but I have friends that have a nine to five, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=122.6s)]
*  like they go to work, they have lunch with their buddies, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=124.0s)]
*  they go home at five, they see their kids [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=126.32s)]
*  there with their wife, and I'm jealous of them. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=127.6s)]
*  Like a normal life. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=129.12s)]
*  It's just a cool town. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=130.64s)]
*  Yeah, it really is. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=131.72s)]
*  But it's an old fashioned town, that's my memory. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=132.56s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=134.51999999999998s)]
*  I've actually brought, when I was at SEAL Team Six, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=135.88s)]
*  I brought about 20 dudes up there to skydive. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  We sold off a skydiving trip for high altitude [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=141.76s)]
*  and then a horseback riding and mules and stuff like that. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=145.12s)]
*  And they got along great with them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=146.56s)]
*  I told the Butte guys, hey, there's a difference [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=149.0s)]
*  between being a tough guy and being a technical fighter, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=152.08s)]
*  so let's just all get along. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=154.64000000000001s)]
*  You don't punch him, you don't punch him, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=156.60000000000002s)]
*  let's just have a drink. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=157.8s)]
*  And we did, it was a blast. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=159.56s)]
*  There was one fight, but it ended a little amicably. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=161.0s)]
*  So you wanted to be a broker. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=163.4s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I just, I thought I would, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=165.24s)]
*  I didn't know anything about it, but my dad did it, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=167.68s)]
*  he looked good in a suit, and I liked his house. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=169.84s)]
*  So you didn't dream of fighting wars? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=171.56s)]
*  No, no, no, we weren't a military family. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=174.88s)]
*  It was, you know, I'd seen Full Metal Jacket [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=177.72s)]
*  and Navy SEALs, but it was never gonna be me. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=180.6s)]
*  I did have two friends that wanted to be [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=183.0s)]
*  in the Marine Corps growing up, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=185.32s)]
*  and they were two years older than me. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=187.6s)]
*  And there was a reason that I went to join the Marine Corps [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=188.44s)]
*  because I saw them when they'd come home. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=190.6s)]
*  And I had one dude that joined the Army, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=192.2s)]
*  and he gave me great advice when I just sort of decided, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=194.24s)]
*  he just said, get it in writing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  And that's good advice for life. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=199.24s)]
*  Yeah, I love when people say, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=201.28s)]
*  let's do business on a handshake. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=202.44s)]
*  It's like, fine, I'll shake your hand [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=203.56s)]
*  after you sign the contract. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=204.4s)]
*  So you went to join the Marine Corps, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=205.92s)]
*  but wound up in the Navy? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because the Marine recruiter was at lunch. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=208.56s)]
*  And I wanted to be a Marine [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=211.68s)]
*  because I wanted to be a sniper. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=213.0s)]
*  And, but the recruiter was gone, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=214.95999999999998s)]
*  the Navy guy was sitting right there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=217.48s)]
*  And he was wearing his khakis, he was a chief, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=218.92s)]
*  and I didn't know what a chief was, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=220.64s)]
*  but he's a senior dude in the enlisted ranks. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=221.72s)]
*  And I went in there, just because my Marine friends [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=223.68s)]
*  told me that the Marine Corps [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=226.2s)]
*  is actually part of the department of the Navy, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=227.16s)]
*  it's just the men's department. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=228.76s)]
*  And so I went to ask him, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  where's the Marine, if anyone will know, you will. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=231.44s)]
*  And like the Army guys are here, Air Force guys are here, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=233.12s)]
*  Marines just not there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=234.76s)]
*  And he said, why do you want the Marine Corps? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=236.04s)]
*  And I said, I wanna be a sniper. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=237.68s)]
*  I'm a hunter and Marines have the best snipers in the world. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=238.56s)]
*  Carlos Hathcock, like I said, full metal jacket, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=240.72s)]
*  I can do that, it looks cool. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=243.2s)]
*  And he said, look no further, we have snipers in the Navy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=245.12s)]
*  You need to be a Navy SEAL first. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=248.0s)]
*  He brushed over that and gave me a contract. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=249.28s)]
*  And I signed, I didn't know what a SEAL was, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=252.56s)]
*  I didn't know how to swim. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=253.64s)]
*  But- [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=254.48s)]
*  Was this at a recruiting center? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=255.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's still there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=256.14s)]
*  I go in there when I go back to be at Montana, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=257.4s)]
*  talk to the recruiters now, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=259.28s)]
*  just to see if anybody wants to be a SEAL, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=260.12s)]
*  or even, maybe I can tell them [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=262.67999999999995s)]
*  that Marine bootcamp is gonna be great, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=264.52s)]
*  or join the Army, be a Ranger, be awesome. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  Just a, it's just a good, it's a good way to grow up. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=267.52s)]
*  Wherever you are in this country, you can go join right now, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=271.67999999999995s)]
*  be on a bus, three hats and a cot, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=274.0s)]
*  you'll be part of a brotherhood somewhere. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=275.32s)]
*  And I mean, just being a Marine would be cool, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=277.79999999999995s)]
*  but he just wasn't there. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=279.52s)]
*  But I look back on it now and I tell my daughters [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=280.44s)]
*  that if that, the butterfly effect, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=282.96s)]
*  if that Marine recruiter wasn't at Arby's at 1130 [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=285.48s)]
*  on a Wednesday, you wouldn't be alive. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=287.52s)]
*  Cause I would have joined the Marine Corps [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=289.16s)]
*  instead of the Navy. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=290.12s)]
*  But I joined the Navy, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=290.96s)]
*  and he showed me the videos of what Navy SEALs are [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=292.24s)]
*  after I signed. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=294.56s)]
*  And I remember I went to get my mom, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=295.92s)]
*  I brought her in and said, check this out. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=297.28s)]
*  And she didn't say it, but she admitted later, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=299.0s)]
*  like, there's no way in hell you're gonna make it through. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=300.88s)]
*  The only one who believed in me was my dad. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=302.84s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=304.76s)]
*  And- [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=305.6s)]
*  What year was this? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=306.44s)]
*  1996. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=307.26s)]
*  I, yeah, I joined in 1996, so I left in 97. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=309.6s)]
*  So what was going on in the world in 1996? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=313.04s)]
*  Nothing, nothing. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=314.48s)]
*  No, I joined in 95. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=315.32s)]
*  I went to bootcamp in 96, January 96, nothing. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=316.24s)]
*  And that's part of the mystique was I can, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=318.88s)]
*  I won't make it through SEAL training, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  but I'll live in San Diego. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=323.28000000000003s)]
*  I'll go to a ship on the fleet for four years. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=325.68s)]
*  I'll come back to Butte and I'll hang out at Maloney's bar [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=328.12s)]
*  and tell sea stories like that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=330.0s)]
*  Like, I'm not gonna make it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=331.12s)]
*  Nobody makes it through SEAL training. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=332.0s)]
*  And that was almost the mindset of a failure. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=333.76s)]
*  So you're a teenager at this point. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=336.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=337.44s)]
*  And I, you know, I learned how to swim. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=338.36s)]
*  I knew I wouldn't quit, but it's- [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  Butte is not on the ocean. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=343.8s)]
*  No, butte, the entire state's landlocked. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=345.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=347.12s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I could keep myself alive, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=348.8s)]
*  but I didn't know any strokes at all. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=350.72s)]
*  I actually ran into a buddy of mine who swam at Notre Dame, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=352.68s)]
*  one of the few swimmers from Montana, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=355.2s)]
*  because I still had my ID from Montana Tech, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=356.76s)]
*  they had a pool. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=358.68s)]
*  And I had a couple, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=359.88s)]
*  I actually had a couple of weeks before I left [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=360.76s)]
*  and I ran into him at the pool and he goes, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  don't take this the wrong way. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=364.52s)]
*  I'm happy to see you in the pool. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=366.8s)]
*  I just literally never seen you in the pool, what gives? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=369.12s)]
*  And I said, I just joined the Navy, I'm gonna be a SEAL. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=371.6s)]
*  And he goes, oh, not like that, you're not. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=373.16s)]
*  And he showed me the breaststroke and the side stroke. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=374.64000000000004s)]
*  And then I practiced that. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=376.56s)]
*  And I was good enough to pass the screening test [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=378.36s)]
*  to get into SEAL training. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  But that's, I mean, that test is easy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  So the first test is a swim test. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=383.56s)]
*  Yeah, well, it's a 500 yard swim, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=385.16s)]
*  42 pushups, 50 sit-ups, eight pull-ups, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=389.44000000000005s)]
*  and then a mile and a half timed run. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=392.40000000000003s)]
*  Like it's really easy. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=393.96000000000004s)]
*  But when I went there, when I went to boot camp [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=395.04s)]
*  and took that test, there's, we're sitting at bleachers, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=396.44000000000005s)]
*  there's 250 dudes on these bleachers. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=398.6s)]
*  And I remember thinking, well, what makes me special? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  There's no way I can make it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=402.88s)]
*  And out of that, 250, two of us passed the test. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=404.08s)]
*  And then when you pass that test, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=407.36s)]
*  then you might get orders. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=408.52s)]
*  And then out of that, two of every 250, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=409.36s)]
*  85% won't make it through training. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=411.84s)]
*  So it's a really, but it's a mindset at a certain point. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=414.0s)]
*  You need to- [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=417.04s)]
*  So from the day you got on the bus as a teenager, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=417.88s)]
*  like, you're in the Navy, how long was it from then [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=421.52s)]
*  until you got your Trident? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=425.56s)]
*  I think, well, it'd been a year. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=427.08s)]
*  Boot camp, no, a year and a half. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=428.92s)]
*  Boot camp was nine weeks. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=431.15999999999997s)]
*  I did a two week A school where basically the Marines [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=433.56s)]
*  taught me how to wind a bobbin and use a sewing machine. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  They called- [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=438.28000000000003s)]
*  Is sewing a big part of it? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=439.12s)]
*  No, no, just, you had to get a rate for a job in the Navy, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=440.12s)]
*  like boats is made or photographers made, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  or I was an air crew survival equipment man, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=445.04s)]
*  just because that's the shortest one to get me to San Diego. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=447.04s)]
*  So I did two weeks in Millington. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=450.24s)]
*  And then I went down to, in April, it would have been 96. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=451.48s)]
*  I checked into Bud's class 208, classed up there. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=454.16s)]
*  And then we graduated in December. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=457.52000000000004s)]
*  But I got some good advice by a guy, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=460.24s)]
*  by the name of Tom Donovan, who is an Admiral now, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  which makes me feel so old. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=464.6s)]
*  He might be a two star, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=466.12s)]
*  but he was fresh out of the Academy. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=467.24s)]
*  And the Naval Academy has a really high rate [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=468.6s)]
*  of guys making through [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=470.72s)]
*  because they screen them so hard in Annapolis. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=471.56s)]
*  And his dad was an Admiral. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=473.64s)]
*  And I remember seeing him, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=474.88s)]
*  and he doesn't even remember saying this, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=475.92s)]
*  but I ran into him in the cages one, one day. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=477.88s)]
*  And I was like, wow, this is crazy. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=480.56s)]
*  Like, I'm scared, but you're like in charge. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=481.76s)]
*  Like, you gotta be really scared. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=484.16s)]
*  He looks at me and goes, the fuck are you afraid of? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=485.08s)]
*  Why are you scared? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=487.48s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=488.48s)]
*  He said, don't be afraid. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=489.88s)]
*  Just, these are just normal dudes. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=491.04s)]
*  Just make it one evolution to the next. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=492.6s)]
*  And he was a student like me, an ensign. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=495.04s)]
*  Great dude. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=497.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, there are guys that when we did Hell Week, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=498.56s)]
*  he personally, there's like at least 20 Navy SEALs [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=501.08s)]
*  that owe their careers to Tom Donovan [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=503.24s)]
*  because he got them through. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=505.56s)]
*  Like just like motivating them as a student. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=506.56s)]
*  So in 96, 97, you're trying to become a Navy SEAL, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=509.76s)]
*  which is the most famous of the American war fighters. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=514.92s)]
*  But what do you think you're gonna be doing? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=519.36s)]
*  I didn't know. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=521.48s)]
*  Did you think about it or are you just so focused on it? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=522.96s)]
*  No, well, I was focused on the training [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=525.0400000000001s)]
*  because I wanted to make it through. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=527.72s)]
*  I had, I keep bringing up Hell Week [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=529.6s)]
*  because that's allegedly the hardest part [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=531.36s)]
*  when you wake up on Sunday and you don't sleep till Friday. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  You're awake the whole time running with boats on your heads [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=535.72s)]
*  and doing evolutions, cold, wet, sandy, miserable. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=537.48s)]
*  Like by Wednesday, every part of your body [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=539.2s)]
*  that's touching cloth starts to bleed [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=541.4000000000001s)]
*  because of the salt water in the sand. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=543.12s)]
*  But I had an instructor, I don't know why he said, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=545.6400000000001s)]
*  I don't know why he was, he didn't need to be motivating, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=548.24s)]
*  but he said, right before Hell Week, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=550.48s)]
*  you're about to go to war for the first time [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=551.76s)]
*  and the enemy is all your doubts, all your fears, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=553.72s)]
*  and everyone you know back home that told you [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=556.36s)]
*  you weren't good enough to do this. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=557.96s)]
*  Keep your head down, keep moving forward. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=559.16s)]
*  You'll be fine. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=561.2s)]
*  One meal at a time. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=562.32s)]
*  He said, another, he said the first day of training [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=564.48s)]
*  was I know you've read the books [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=568.84s)]
*  and probably seen the movies [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=570.52s)]
*  regardless of what you've been told. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=571.88s)]
*  However, this course is not impossible. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=573.32s)]
*  People graduate, look at me, I'm living proof. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=575.24s)]
*  So I will never ask you to do anything impossible, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=577.92s)]
*  but I will make you do something very hard, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=579.88s)]
*  followed immediately by something very hard, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=581.4399999999999s)]
*  followed by something even harder, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=583.36s)]
*  day after day after day for eight straight months. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=584.56s)]
*  And that sounds like a lot to get from now [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=586.7199999999999s)]
*  to graduation day, but don't think about it that way. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=588.16s)]
*  That's not how you achieve a long-term goal. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=589.88s)]
*  Do it like this, wake up in the morning on time, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  make your bed the right way and then brush your teeth. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=593.8399999999999s)]
*  That's three wins. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=595.52s)]
*  You just started your day with three victories. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=596.4799999999999s)]
*  Make it to the 4 a.m. workout on time. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=598.1999999999999s)]
*  And when I'm beating, you don't think about the pain, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=601.52s)]
*  concentrate on your next goal in life, which is breakfast. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=603.1999999999999s)]
*  After breakfast, your next goal in life is lunch. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=605.8s)]
*  After lunch, it's dinner. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=607.4s)]
*  After dinner, do everything you need to do [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=608.76s)]
*  to get back inside that perfectly made bed. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=610.36s)]
*  And because you took the time in the morning [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=612.12s)]
*  to make your bed the right way, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=613.48s)]
*  regardless of how bad today was, and it'll be bad, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=615.0s)]
*  tomorrow's a clean slate. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=618.4s)]
*  Tomorrow's a fresh start. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=620.0799999999999s)]
*  And when you feel like quitting, which you will, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=621.76s)]
*  do not quit right now, that's emotion. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=623.36s)]
*  Quit tomorrow. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  If you can keep quitting tomorrow, you can do anything. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=626.8s)]
*  And just, that's the mindset that the, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=629.1999999999999s)]
*  I needed that because I went there scared. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=631.36s)]
*  It's like, well, I'll just quit. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=633.1999999999999s)]
*  Because it's almost like fear of the unknown. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=634.04s)]
*  Or watching other guys quit. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=638.2s)]
*  Like a loud mouth or a big tough guy [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=639.5600000000001s)]
*  or a college football player. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=641.5600000000001s)]
*  He quits, it's like, well, shit, if he can't make it, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=642.6s)]
*  I can't make it. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=644.32s)]
*  And that's like sympathetic quitting. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=645.16s)]
*  Just let him go. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=646.84s)]
*  No one's better than you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=648.16s)]
*  Just because you're from Butte, Montana, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=649.0s)]
*  or from West Palm Beach, or from Long Island, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=650.52s)]
*  doesn't mean someone from Chicago's better than you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=653.64s)]
*  And people, like Butte, Montana, we're almost in a bubble. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=656.16s)]
*  Like the other side of the continental divide [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=659.72s)]
*  is you got Seattle, Portland, San Francisco. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=662.2s)]
*  They gotta be better athletes than me or something. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=664.44s)]
*  But don't believe that shit. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=666.16s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  Just gotta keep the right mindset. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=668.64s)]
*  How many guys quit? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=669.48s)]
*  We had a big class. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=670.76s)]
*  Out of our 227, we graduated 33. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=671.7199999999999s)]
*  That was big. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=674.0799999999999s)]
*  Two classes before us, they graduated seven. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=675.36s)]
*  There was a class that graduated zero. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=678.0799999999999s)]
*  Like they call it the class that never was. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=680.24s)]
*  They got down to so few that like, well, you're all done. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=682.0s)]
*  Gotta go to the next class. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=684.3199999999999s)]
*  But then the older you get, it's funny you get, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=686.04s)]
*  every Navy SEAL always says, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  my class was the last hard class. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=690.4s)]
*  Cause they're easy now. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=692.8399999999999s)]
*  And they're like, what do you mean? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=694.0s)]
*  I'm like, well, we graduated two. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=694.8399999999999s)]
*  They made us fight it out. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=695.88s)]
*  Just bullshit. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=697.28s)]
*  Here's the facts of life. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=699.68s)]
*  You may not learn until you're older, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=700.72s)]
*  but I'm gonna tell you now. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=702.0s)]
*  It's very hard to have a good time [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=703.2s)]
*  if you're wearing bad boots. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=705.08s)]
*  In fact, it may be impossible. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=706.76s)]
*  And that's why you need Tacovas. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=708.08s)]
*  As a matter of fact, you don't just need them. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=710.08s)]
*  You owe them to yourself. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=711.28s)]
*  Tacovas makes Western boots for everybody. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=713.0s)]

*  You don't have to compromise between looks and quality. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=729.68s)]
*  You can have them both. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=732.88s)]
*  Whether it's a long day or a big night, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=734.12s)]
*  Tacovas are built to last and impressed. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=735.88s)]

*  the dark sense of humor. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=758.76s)]
*  And misery loves company. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=760.3599999999999s)]
*  We say that all the time. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=761.8399999999999s)]
*  One guy that I met during hell week, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=763.4399999999999s)]
*  you're cold and wet and miserable the whole time, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=767.28s)]
*  but every day, at least once a day during hell week, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=769.56s)]
*  they send you to medical. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=771.7199999999999s)]
*  They check you out. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=773.3199999999999s)]
*  They look at your eyes because you're gonna be delirious. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=774.16s)]
*  Freezing, you're shaking. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=776.24s)]
*  And then as soon as you're done with medical, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=777.64s)]
*  you have a dry uniform and dry boots, dry socks. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=779.7199999999999s)]
*  As soon as you put them on, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=782.64s)]
*  you're right back in the water. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=783.76s)]
*  Like it just sucks. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=784.6s)]
*  And I was trying to tie my boots one time and I couldn't. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=785.9200000000001s)]
*  My hands were shaking so bad. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=788.6s)]

*  hey Barker, can you pee on my hands? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=791.4s)]

*  And he's freezing. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=796.5600000000001s)]
*  He just goes, well, yeah, if you're into that. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=797.4s)]
*  I'm like, no, I'm not. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=799.0s)]
*  That was funny. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=800.64s)]
*  But I mean, just the dry sense of humor [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=802.16s)]
*  and the camaraderie and that sense of humor. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  But that's what you need. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=805.44s)]
*  When we were going after Marcus Luttrell, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=807.5600000000001s)]
*  we were awake for about three days. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=809.4s)]
*  We were on top of these mountains in Eastern Afghanistan [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=811.0s)]
*  and we're exhausted. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=813.68s)]
*  And I looked at my guys and I said, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=814.52s)]
*  this is why training is so hard. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=815.36s)]
*  Because if we were gonna quit right now, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=816.96s)]
*  where the fuck are we gonna go? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=818.64s)]
*  We're just here. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=819.96s)]
*  And that's why you've been through the training [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=821.96s)]
*  and then combat's way worse. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=824.28s)]
*  Even being at the SEAL teams is way worse [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=825.4399999999999s)]
*  than SEAL training. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=826.96s)]
*  That's just the initial welcome [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=827.96s)]
*  to the Naval Special Warfare. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=830.6s)]
*  Did you have any sense of that when you completed training? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=832.84s)]
*  Did you have a sense that I'm gonna do shocking things? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=836.76s)]
*  No. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=841.4399999999999s)]
*  10 years. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=842.28s)]
*  When we finished SEAL training, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=843.1199999999999s)]
*  the last part is 40 days, maybe 30 days [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=844.1199999999999s)]
*  on San Clemente Island where they say [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=846.76s)]
*  no one can hear you scream. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=848.3199999999999s)]
*  You go out to this training site and it's no time off. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=849.64s)]
*  Then when you get done with that, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  it was a Monday and we're graduating Friday. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=853.8399999999999s)]
*  And I remember the instructor saying, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=855.92s)]
*  all right, go to admin and go to dental, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=857.04s)]
*  get your service record, your medical record [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=858.4799999999999s)]
*  so you're checking into SEAL team too. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=859.9599999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, well shit, what does that even mean? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=861.1199999999999s)]
*  What do you mean I'm done? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=863.4799999999999s)]
*  This shouldn't end. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=864.7199999999999s)]
*  Now you gotta go be a SEAL. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=866.0799999999999s)]
*  So good luck. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=867.0s)]
*  Did they give you any sense of what that would mean? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=868.3599999999999s)]
*  No, I picked two, two, eight and four [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=870.52s)]
*  because they were on the East Coast [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=873.8399999999999s)]
*  and I wanted to go to two because they were in Bosnia [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=874.68s)]
*  and that's the closest thing to combat. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=877.0s)]
*  And I thought I wanted to combat. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=878.36s)]
*  That's before I went to combat. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=879.56s)]
*  And they're in Sarajevo, Kosovo's popping off. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=881.3199999999999s)]
*  We'll get in there. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=883.8399999999999s)]
*  So I went to SEAL team too. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=884.8399999999999s)]
*  And then, I mean, they don't really teach you anything [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=885.8399999999999s)]
*  in SEAL training. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=889.64s)]
*  Then when we got to the team in my era, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=890.4799999999999s)]
*  then it was SEAL tactical training, a 13 week course, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=892.68s)]
*  where they finally teach you how to do stuff. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=895.12s)]
*  And then you go to a platoon, which is 16 guys, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=897.0s)]
*  and that group works together for a full year, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=899.2s)]
*  getting to know standard operating procedures [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=900.92s)]
*  and how, you know, tendencies. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=902.6s)]
*  And then they sent us overseas. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=904.28s)]
*  So my first deployment was in summer of 1998 [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=905.52s)]
*  on the USS Austin. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=908.52s)]
*  We went to the Mediterranean. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=909.96s)]
*  You know, there was, we heard about Al Qaeda. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=912.36s)]
*  They were in Albania because there was some sort [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=914.32s)]
*  of an exercise and they threatened them. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=915.84s)]
*  And I had just finished sniper school. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=918.8s)]
*  I'm kind of jumping around here. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=919.96s)]
*  I just finished sniper school. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=920.84s)]
*  So I was on a rooftop with a range card, you know, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=921.76s)]
*  out to a thousand yards looking at this place like, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=925.92s)]
*  okay, I made it. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=927.84s)]
*  I'm not a SEAL now, but there was nothing. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=928.68s)]
*  It was, you know, before 9-11. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=930.16s)]
*  So I thought I was high speedish. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=931.2399999999999s)]
*  In Albania. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=932.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=933.4s)]
*  Yeah. But I mean, if you're like- [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=934.52s)]
*  I'm not sure most Americans understand [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=935.7199999999999s)]
*  we sent SEALs to Albania. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=937.12s)]
*  What are SEALs doing in Albania? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=938.56s)]
*  Well, you got to figure that part of the, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=940.8s)]
*  was the Adriatic and you got all kinds of Al Qaeda guys [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=942.16s)]
*  in Kosovo, Bosnia. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=945.1999999999999s)]
*  So they're going to be in Albania too. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=946.02s)]
*  I mean, of course it makes sense. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  And it's a heavily Muslim country. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=948.9599999999999s)]
*  And, but I guess my question is, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  did you understand just how large the landscape was? [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=954.0s)]
*  No, because we were just basically training. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=959.52s)]
*  We spent a lot of time with the special boat service [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=962.32s)]
*  in the UK. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=964.2s)]
*  A lot of time with the German comp swimmers, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=965.4s)]
*  Norwegian Jägers, those are bad ass dudes. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=967.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=969.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=969.9200000000001s)]
*  They're really good, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=971.08s)]
*  but they don't get involved because their government sucks, [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  but they're studs. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=973.52s)]
*  I talk about skiing and rock climbing. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=974.9200000000001s)]
*  Never seen anything like it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=976.16s)]
*  Plus the best looking dudes in the world, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=977.0s)]
*  like got to be honest. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=978.44s)]
*  Just saying. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=979.5600000000001s)]
*  The Norwegian? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=980.4s)]
*  Yeah. They're studs. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=981.24s)]
*  Like they're really good. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=982.08s)]
*  Telemark skiing, there's nobody better. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=983.44s)]
*  So combat skiing, rucksack guns and all that crap, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=986.72s)]
*  like carrying the old M14s [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=989.36s)]
*  because they work better in cold weather. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=990.72s)]
*  But we were training just because contingencies. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=992.6800000000001s)]
*  Like we don't know, Russia's gone, Cold War's over. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=995.9200000000001s)]
*  Nothing's going to happen. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=999.48s)]
*  So we're basically going to be safe. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1000.36s)]
*  And when my time came up after four years, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1001.6400000000001s)]
*  I knew the guys and I'm like, I'm 23. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1005.8000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to go home now. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1008.84s)]
*  I want to stay with these guys. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1009.8000000000001s)]
*  So I reenlisted just to stay with the guys at SEAL Team 2. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1011.1600000000001s)]
*  What year was that? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1013.5600000000001s)]
*  That would have been 1999 or right around 2000. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1014.4s)]
*  No, 2000. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1016.92s)]
*  Jocko reenlisted me on a Humvee in Kuwait. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1017.76s)]
*  But I reenlisted because I knew the guys. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1021.68s)]
*  And then 9-11 happened and I'm like, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1023.4399999999999s)]
*  well, I can't get out now. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1025.4s)]
*  And then I ran into a dude from SEAL Team 6 [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1027.12s)]
*  at a Navy exchange. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1031.0s)]
*  I was taking a leadership course at Damnik, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1033.92s)]
*  which is near Oceania and Virginia Beach. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1036.92s)]
*  That's where SEAL Team 6 is. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1038.56s)]
*  And I'm taking this course and I went over [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1039.84s)]
*  to the Navy exchange, which is a mall, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1041.32s)]
*  in my uniform with a trident. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1042.96s)]
*  And there's this dude in there with flip-flop shorts, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1044.9599999999998s)]
*  a beard and long hair, and he's eyeballing me. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1046.84s)]
*  Because he knew I was a SEAL and I'm like, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1049.0s)]
*  well, that's a SEAL Team 6 guy and that arrogant fuck. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1050.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to find out what that place is like. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1052.7199999999998s)]
*  That's the only reason I went to SEAL Team 6 [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1053.9199999999998s)]
*  because that guy was mean mugging me. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1055.1599999999999s)]
*  Wow. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1056.9599999999998s)]
*  But again, that's how life's decisions, the smallest. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1057.8s)]
*  So 2001, you've been in five years? [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1060.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1062.52s)]
*  Did anyone you know shoot anyone during those five years? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1064.04s)]
*  No, there was rumors of one guy [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1068.6s)]
*  might have got a kill in Bosnia. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1070.3999999999999s)]
*  But the only guys who were shooting [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1072.4s)]
*  would have been Somalia right around 1993. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1074.16s)]
*  And then 91. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1078.2s)]
*  I don't think SEALs even did anything in Desert Storm. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1079.0400000000002s)]
*  And then you had Patia Airfield in Panama in 1989. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1080.5600000000002s)]
*  And those dudes are just legends [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1083.3600000000001s)]
*  because they got in a gunfight. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1084.3600000000001s)]
*  And some guys did a combat swimmer op. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1085.4s)]
*  They swam over to, instead of blowing up Noriega's boats, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1087.64s)]
*  I guess they were told to unscrew the screw [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1091.0s)]
*  on the back of the boat. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1092.76s)]
*  Typical American, let's just be nice about being mean. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1093.8000000000002s)]
*  Just unscrew it, just blow the damn boat up. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1096.8400000000001s)]
*  But those guys were just legends. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1099.0800000000002s)]
*  And nothing until we just finished a 40 day thing [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1100.6399999999999s)]
*  in Kosovo or 30 days and we're sending out emails [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1104.6399999999999s)]
*  and then the towers were hit. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1107.6s)]
*  And then we're like. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1108.6s)]
*  Where were you when that happened? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1109.4399999999998s)]
*  Germany, I was at Stuttgart. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1110.28s)]
*  What were you doing? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1111.7199999999998s)]
*  Just a deployment. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1112.76s)]
*  We had a unit over there. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1113.6s)]
*  So we'd go over there and we would stage out of Germany. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1115.0s)]
*  So we went to Lithuania for training, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1117.6s)]
*  went again to Norway over to Scotland. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1119.6s)]
*  And we do training around there. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1121.1999999999998s)]
*  Kosovo was the real world stuff. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1122.24s)]
*  And then back to Germany, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1123.9599999999998s)]
*  because that's where all of our stuff was. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1124.8s)]
*  We deployed to Germany, it's called the Yukon. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1125.62s)]
*  So European command. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1127.76s)]
*  Special forces are over there and SEALs go over there. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1129.0s)]
*  And then we had a place in Rota, Spain too. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1131.2s)]
*  But that's where deployments were and that's all you do. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1134.0s)]
*  When I was on the deployment with Jaco and Drago [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1138.52s)]
*  and Scott Paget and Steve Drum, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1141.16s)]
*  the one mission we did was we took down a Russian tanker [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1143.48s)]
*  full of smuggled Iraqi oil and there was no resistance. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1147.2s)]
*  I mean, we were taking away steak knives [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1150.64s)]
*  because there was weapons, like just bullshit mission. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1152.12s)]
*  Where was it? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1154.48s)]
*  That would have been in the Persian Gulf. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1155.6s)]
*  They were smuggling oil. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1156.72s)]
*  We hopped on that, drove it to Oman [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1157.86s)]
*  and we made headlines and we thought we were high speed. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1159.1s)]
*  So that would have been right around 2000. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1161.1s)]
*  What did the Russians say when you boarded their ship [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1162.7s)]
*  and stole it? [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1164.5s)]
*  They didn't have a choice. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1165.34s)]
*  We came in with a helicopter. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  I was a sniper in the helicopter [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1167.22s)]
*  and our guys fast roped down and our guys just took it. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1168.06s)]
*  We're good at that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1170.34s)]
*  There was, but no, we're anticipating resistance, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1171.7s)]
*  but I don't think they had any guns. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1173.74s)]
*  So, but that was like at the time- [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1175.52s)]
*  Were they annoyed that you stole their ship? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1177.02s)]
*  Yeah, but we were doing stuff like that. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1178.5s)]
*  Like people were smuggling dates [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1180.34s)]
*  and we would take down these little Dow boats, dates. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1182.18s)]
*  Like, all right. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1184.1399999999999s)]
*  Dates like the fruit? [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1185.1399999999999s)]
*  Dates, they're smuggling dates. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1185.98s)]
*  So let's go save the planet. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1188.3000000000002s)]
*  Literally Navy SEALs taking down boats with dates. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1189.6200000000001s)]
*  That's it. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1192.26s)]
*  So your hours at work may not be the most comfortable [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1193.3000000000002s)]
*  of your day. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1195.54s)]
*  You're maybe sitting in a stuffy office. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1196.38s)]
*  You're standing out in the beating sun on a job site. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1198.3400000000001s)]
*  Whatever you're doing during the day, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1201.7s)]
*  you're probably not that comfortable [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1204.14s)]
*  and you can't get around it [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1205.98s)]
*  because we are all commanded to work and most of us do. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1206.9s)]
*  But when you get time off, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1210.0s)]
*  you deserve something much more comfortable [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1211.42s)]
*  and our friends at Cozy Earth can help you. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1213.3600000000001s)]
*  They've designed bamboo sheets. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1215.42s)]
*  And yes, that sounds bizarre until you try them. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1217.5800000000002s)]
*  Bamboo, it's actually an amazing natural product. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1220.98s)]
*  Sheets made from bamboo naturally wick away heat [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1226.8200000000002s)]
*  and help your body maintain a cooler temperature [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1229.9s)]
*  throughout the night. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1231.94s)]
*  It makes a huge difference. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1232.78s)]
*  So it may be hard to believe, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1234.1000000000001s)]
*  but Cozy Earth is offering 100 nights sleep trials. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1235.8600000000001s)]

*  with no financial risk. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1241.3000000000002s)]

*  Trust me, you're gonna feel the difference [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1250.78s)]
*  the very first night. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1252.04s)]
*  Cooler in bamboo, plus it's awesome sounding. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1253.3s)]
*  I'm sleeping in bamboo. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1256.6000000000001s)]
*  Stay cozy at Cozy Earth. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1258.08s)]
*  So you go from that to what? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1260.06s)]
*  Well, the 9-11 and it's just... [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1262.82s)]
*  How soon did you realize this changes everything? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1264.46s)]
*  The second, the minute the second plane hit the tower, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1267.14s)]
*  the south tower, and we just assumed, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1271.44s)]
*  because we were already overseas, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1273.9s)]
*  they're just gonna keep us here and we'll go to Sudan [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1274.9s)]
*  because that's where a lot of al-Qaeda is. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1276.3400000000001s)]
*  We didn't know, we didn't think Afghanistan, us, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1277.7800000000002s)]
*  but someone knew somewhere. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1280.22s)]
*  So, but we stayed over there for another month [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1281.0600000000002s)]
*  and then we went back and then redeployed. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1282.94s)]
*  To where? [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1285.18s)]
*  Well, we were heading over to invade Iraq. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1286.26s)]
*  I was on a boat, it was 2003. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1289.1000000000001s)]
*  We were on with Marines. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1290.9s)]
*  They're gonna go through Turkey, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1291.74s)]
*  but then something happened in Liberia. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1293.14s)]
*  So they sent the Marines off and then we turned around [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1295.2800000000002s)]
*  and had to swim into Liberia to do [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1297.18s)]
*  hydrographic reconnaissance for the Marines to come in [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1300.98s)]
*  and save people out of the embassy. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1302.98s)]
*  I mean, that was a different, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1305.4199999999998s)]
*  that's a different place to be too [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1307.3s)]
*  because it's a civil war. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1309.32s)]
*  Liberia is named after Liberty [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1311.54s)]
*  and then Monrovia is the capital named after President Macron [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1312.6999999999998s)]
*  because they sent us. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1314.82s)]
*  I was there then that year, summer of 2003. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1315.98s)]
*  The most dangerous thing we were thinking about [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1319.4199999999998s)]
*  was sharks or saltwater crocodiles. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1321.1599999999999s)]
*  When we got there, the people loved to see us. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1324.26s)]
*  They thought we were liberating them. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1325.82s)]
*  No shots fired, but there was a civil war going on [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1327.54s)]
*  like cannibalism. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1329.78s)]
*  So it's kind of an awakening, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1330.62s)]
*  but we missed the invasion of Iraq and then turned around [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1332.32s)]
*  and then I went. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1334.72s)]
*  We're in Liberia. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1335.56s)]
*  Did you see General Butt naked when you were there? [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1336.52s)]
*  No. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1338.44s)]
*  He was a major commander. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1339.52s)]
*  Yeah, no, I didn't even, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1341.04s)]
*  I'm not familiar with that at all. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1342.32s)]
*  General Butt naked. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1343.6s)]
*  It describes his uniform. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1345.84s)]
*  So you're in Liberia, wow. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1348.96s)]
*  When they're invading Iraq. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1350.6s)]
*  So they're already in Afghanistan. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1351.48s)]
*  They're invading Iraq and we're in Liberia, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1353.0s)]
*  which is just weird. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1354.72s)]
*  But yeah, that was that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1356.48s)]
*  And then went back and then I screened for a SEAL Team Six [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1359.04s)]
*  and went through selection. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1361.6s)]
*  Then my first deployment to Afghanistan was 2005. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1362.4399999999998s)]
*  Went to Jalalabad right around the time [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  that Turbine 3-3 was shot down, Redwings, lone survivor. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1367.8s)]
*  Why did you, what is SEAL Team Six [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1372.32s)]
*  and why did you want to be in it? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1374.36s)]
*  SEAL Team Six is the National Mission Force. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1375.6799999999998s)]
*  And so they were designed [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1377.8s)]
*  to rescue American hostages at sea. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1378.8999999999999s)]
*  If a cruise ship gets like, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1381.32s)]
*  so Delta Force will do the airplanes and stuff [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1382.3999999999999s)]
*  and then we'll do the water on paper. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1385.04s)]
*  And that's just where the best SEALs go [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1388.28s)]
*  because half of the guys that get selected [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1390.72s)]
*  to try out don't make it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1394.04s)]
*  These are Navy SEALs, like experienced Navy SEALs, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1395.66s)]
*  usually five or six years in the SEAL Teams [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1399.6000000000001s)]
*  and then they try out for SEAL Team Six. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1401.84s)]
*  And it's just a hard selection course. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1404.3600000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of close quarters battle, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1405.84s)]
*  a lot of drills designed to make you fail [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1408.2s)]
*  and to see just to see how you handle failing [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1412.08s)]
*  because they don't really care if you succeed. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1414.16s)]
*  They want to see how you handle failure. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1416.02s)]
*  It's not about physical fitness. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1417.16s)]
*  No, well, you do at least a 10 mile run every morning [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1418.6s)]
*  and then you get into the training. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1421.1599999999999s)]
*  And like skydiving, a high altitude, high opening jumps. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1422.36s)]
*  That's when you jump out of a plane [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1425.6s)]
*  and you can go to a spot 11 miles away under canopy. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1426.6s)]
*  Like look, even looking down at your GPS, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1429.4399999999998s)]
*  you can't feel any wind, but you're going 90 miles an hour. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1431.6s)]
*  It's a crazy experience. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1434.24s)]
*  Jumping at night, jumping bundles, jumping tandems, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1435.84s)]
*  jumping gear, testing stuff out. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1438.6s)]
*  And that's scary. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1442.24s)]
*  I mean, when you can't see anything, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1443.24s)]
*  but you know you're at altitude, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1445.9599999999998s)]
*  you know you're at 25,000 feet, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1447.44s)]
*  like you think you're looking at Tucson, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1448.56s)]
*  oh wait, that's actually Phoenix [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1449.72s)]
*  because I'm so high up here. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1451.48s)]
*  And then, you know, like even on a 25, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1453.0800000000002s)]
*  we would do 25,000 foot halos, so high altitude, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1455.48s)]
*  low opening and it's weird. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1457.6000000000001s)]
*  We were wearing the old school altimeters with the dial [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1459.48s)]
*  and watching it get to zero [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1462.88s)]
*  and knowing you're not going to hit the earth [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1464.6000000000001s)]
*  because you got another 13,000 feet to go. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1466.02s)]
*  It's crazy feeling, but it's so dark you can't see it. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1467.52s)]
*  You got to trust your- [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1470.04s)]
*  How long is the fall in a halo? [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1471.1200000000001s)]
*  For that would be about two minutes. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1472.44s)]
*  Normally when we jump at 13, it's about a minute. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1474.3s)]
*  Depending on what you're doing. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1478.4s)]
*  If you jump at tandem, you have to set a drogue chute, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1479.24s)]
*  like a six foot drogue chute to stay [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1481.44s)]
*  at terminal velocity with everyone else. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1482.8000000000002s)]
*  We're jumping a bundle. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1484.8200000000002s)]
*  What's a bundle? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1485.96s)]
*  A bundle is a huge barrel that weighs about 400 pounds [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1486.8000000000002s)]
*  and it's full of extra gear. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1490.0s)]
*  So it'll be radios, batteries, bombs, bullets, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1492.3200000000002s)]
*  just stuff that guys can't carry. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1495.16s)]
*  So the bundle master jumps all of it [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1496.5s)]
*  and then you break it out and you hand it out [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1497.92s)]
*  when you get down there. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1499.16s)]
*  And some guys like it because it hits, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1500.24s)]
*  like when you're jumping at night, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1502.3600000000001s)]
*  under night vision, you can sort of see the ground, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1505.2s)]
*  but you want to flare when you get to the bottom [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1507.44s)]
*  and that turns the back of the parachute down [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1510.16s)]
*  so you can stop. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1512.5600000000002s)]
*  But if you flare too high, it needs to eat again. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1514.0800000000002s)]
*  Then it'll just drop you from 10 feet. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1516.3200000000002s)]
*  So you kind of judge where you want to do it, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1517.52s)]
*  but the bundle will hit the ground first [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1519.16s)]
*  and you hear it hit and then it kind of pulls you down. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1521.24s)]
*  But the entire time, the bundle's trying to kill you [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1523.0400000000002s)]
*  on the way down. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1525.5600000000002s)]
*  So you're connected to a 400 pound barrel? [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1526.38s)]
*  With a 10 foot tether, yeah. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1528.8000000000002s)]
*  I mean, that sounds unappealing. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1531.1200000000001s)]
*  It is. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1532.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's one of those things I did [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1533.5800000000002s)]
*  just because I wanted that qual. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1534.8s)]
*  I want to say that I'm a tandem master, a bundle master. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1536.32s)]
*  I just want that qualification. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1538.96s)]
*  What can go wrong when you're jumping [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1540.52s)]
*  with a 400 pound barrel? [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1541.6s)]
*  A lot of stuff can go wrong. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1542.52s)]
*  Everything from when you start, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1543.96s)]
*  you got to set your drogue parachute. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1545.44s)]
*  If that doesn't set, you have to know it by feel [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1548.84s)]
*  that you're now going faster than everyone else [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1551.24s)]
*  and you got to get it set out there. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1553.0s)]
*  You got to get that thing out there. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1554.72s)]
*  Then once you're falling with it, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1555.9199999999998s)]
*  I've had an occasion where when I pull, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1558.6s)]
*  so when you pull, like little things, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1560.52s)]
*  like remember to cross your legs [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1562.44s)]
*  because you don't want to snap your nuts off [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1563.56s)]
*  because you got this thing in your chest. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1565.12s)]
*  Little things? [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1566.2s)]
*  Little things like that. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1567.04s)]
*  Details. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1568.08s)]
*  In my case anyway. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1568.9199999999998s)]
*  But once that pulls too, then you got to check your canopy, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1569.74s)]
*  make sure it works. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1573.24s)]
*  You got all nine cells up there. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1574.08s)]
*  Make sure the brakes work and then you do a little test. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1576.2s)]
*  But I've had it before where only half the parachute opened [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1578.1599999999999s)]
*  and then it's in a dive and I'm in the middle [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1580.44s)]
*  and this thing's spinning violently. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1582.1599999999999s)]
*  Oh, the 400 pound barrel is spinning violently? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1584.08s)]
*  And I'm in the middle of it. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1586.8799999999999s)]
*  And this is the drifidyl force is pulling me to the, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1587.72s)]
*  I had a line twist behind me. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1590.36s)]
*  So it's pinning my head to my chest [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1593.58s)]
*  and the cutaway for the bundles right here. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1595.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'm lucky I pulled on a high altitude jump at 10,000 [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1597.8s)]
*  because normally you pull at five five [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1601.56s)]
*  and I actually burned about 7,000 feet in this spin. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1602.7199999999998s)]
*  If I would have, and so I remember saying to myself, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1605.0s)]
*  if you ever want to see your daughters again, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1608.6799999999998s)]
*  you got to get this now because it's like, I can hear it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1610.5s)]
*  And the grounds come and I pulled it. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1613.28s)]
*  The thing shot off. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1614.8799999999999s)]
*  It's got a parachute on it. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1615.6999999999998s)]
*  So it landed in farmer Brownsfield. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1616.54s)]
*  I landed by myself under this 400 foot canopy [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1618.48s)]
*  and my buddy Phil came out to me. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1620.92s)]
*  He didn't see the malfunction, but he came out [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1622.8400000000001s)]
*  and he goes, you look like you just saw a ghost. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1624.3600000000001s)]
*  Are you okay? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1626.0800000000002s)]
*  And I said, somebody needs to change that. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1627.0s)]
*  This high speed canopy with that low speed cutaway [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1630.44s)]
*  has got to change that because we just changed [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1633.6000000000001s)]
*  the new parachutes, these high performance parachutes. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1635.44s)]
*  Someone's going to die. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1637.3400000000001s)]
*  And a year later, Lance Maccarlo died of the same malfunction [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1638.6000000000001s)]
*  because they didn't fix it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1640.94s)]
*  And then they fixed it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1641.78s)]
*  It's like, why didn't you fix that? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  What happened to him? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  Same exact malfunction, except he pulled at five five [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1644.92s)]
*  and he couldn't get it out and he smacked into the ground. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1647.38s)]
*  And like some of my buddies went out there to him. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1650.22s)]
*  They had a, they criked him with a pen, like a writing pen. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1653.46s)]
*  Cut his neck and put it in there, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1656.94s)]
*  tried to get him to breathe and he died out there. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1657.8600000000001s)]
*  And that's in training. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1661.3s)]
*  Training, and this is during war. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1663.02s)]
*  Like he, I don't remember what year that was 2008 maybe. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1664.22s)]
*  But yeah, I mean, the training's dangerous, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1667.5s)]
*  but it has to be done because well, we do all that. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1670.42s)]
*  We do all the jumps, all the wind tunnel time, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1673.1000000000001s)]
*  indoor skydiving because that one jump [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1674.98s)]
*  that you need to nail the exit, you can. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1677.82s)]
*  Like Captain Phillips, like everyone there [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1679.34s)]
*  had been in the tunnel, had done the jump. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1681.7s)]
*  That's just, cause you got to nail that exit. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1683.06s)]
*  When you leave an aircraft, especially a C-17, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1684.82s)]
*  you're hitting the relative wind at first. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1688.02s)]
*  So 130 knots. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1689.82s)]
*  So you're actually hitting that wind straight [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1690.9s)]
*  until it transitions you to go down. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1693.54s)]
*  So when you jump out, especially with the rucksack, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1695.28s)]
*  it's going to pull you. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1696.96s)]
*  And if you mess with it, you could flip and then you don't, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1698.46s)]
*  if you pull on your back, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1700.54s)]
*  your canopy could come out in a horseshoe [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1702.18s)]
*  and wrap around your neck and people have died that way. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1703.68s)]
*  So you really got to nail an exit. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1705.62s)]
*  So we trained that much for that one jump. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1706.74s)]
*  How many jumps are you doing? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1708.86s)]
*  I had, I've had over a thousand probably. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1710.18s)]
*  A thousand? [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1711.94s)]
*  Yeah, that's not, that's not a lot either. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1712.78s)]
*  Like some of our, some of our instructors, 20 some thousand [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1713.78s)]
*  cause we hired civilians like Arizona arsenal [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1717.5s)]
*  and Marana, Arizona, best skydivers in the world. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1719.94s)]
*  So we started to hire the best in the world [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1724.66s)]
*  to teach us this, like the best fighters, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1726.54s)]
*  the best skydivers, the best shooters, the best drivers, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1728.04s)]
*  just to teach us how to do what they do. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1730.26s)]
*  And they taught us how to do exits [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1731.74s)]
*  and learn how to fly canopies. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1732.94s)]
*  Over a thousand jumps. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1734.54s)]
*  So that's multiple jumps a day. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1736.74s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'd go that out there a lot. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1738.1s)]
*  I would, I would do about eight trips a year [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1739.42s)]
*  to Arizona for two, three weeks at a time, just to skydive. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1741.96s)]
*  How often are you skydiving when you're out there? [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1744.82s)]
*  Every day, six a day. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1746.8999999999999s)]
*  Six jumps a day. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1748.42s)]
*  Maybe more, depending on your attitude. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1749.3799999999999s)]
*  Like the guys would say for 10 or guys just wanting [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1751.58s)]
*  to get back to the Trident Bar and Grill [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1754.42s)]
*  with Nelson Miller owns that place. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1755.6599999999999s)]
*  This is fun to hang out. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1756.82s)]
*  Did you lose your fear of jumping out? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1757.86s)]
*  Yeah, there was never a fear of jumping. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1760.78s)]
*  The first jump is like looking through straws. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1763.18s)]
*  Like you really lose your periphery, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1767.18s)]
*  but then it starts to get easier and easier. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1769.34s)]
*  And then, so jumping is not, I mean, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1770.7s)]
*  when you're strapped to a bunch of stuff at night, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1773.3s)]
*  it's definitely sporty, but it's not fear. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1775.34s)]
*  It's like, I know how to handle this. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1777.6399999999999s)]
*  And I'd rather, like the army jump static line [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1778.72s)]
*  where you connect to the thing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1781.3799999999999s)]
*  and you jump at 2,500 feet or whatever. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1782.74s)]
*  Like that, I don't want to be connected [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1784.7s)]
*  to the aircraft I'm jumping out of. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1786.06s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1787.3799999999999s)]
*  I'd rather have time to, I've got a minute to work [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1788.22s)]
*  on any high speed malfunction or low speed malfunction. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1790.52s)]
*  I can solve it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1792.68s)]
*  But that's, I mean, 2,500 feet doesn't give you [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1793.52s)]
*  a lot of time to react. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1795.48s)]
*  No, well, that's like the 82nd Airborne. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1796.32s)]
*  Like they're just throwing hundreds of people at once [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1798.0s)]
*  in like vehicles and stuff. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1800.04s)]
*  Like that's ranger stuff. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1801.6s)]
*  Like we can take an airfield. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1802.72s)]
*  And ours is high altitude, high opening, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1804.92s)]
*  because we can ideally jump in and then float [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1806.48s)]
*  without anyone seeing us. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1809.0s)]
*  And I've had friends do that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1811.68s)]
*  I had one of my really good friends is, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1812.56s)]
*  he led the jump to into Somalia to rescue Jessica Buchanan. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1814.94s)]
*  And they jumped, I think 17 dudes in 40 knot winds [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1819.16s)]
*  that like we wouldn't have jumped in training, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1823.28s)]
*  but he did that. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1824.92s)]
*  And they led it and they killed like 22 terrorists [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1825.74s)]
*  and rescued both hostages. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1827.48s)]
*  And that again, that's just because he was prepared. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1829.0800000000002s)]
*  His team was ready. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1832.52s)]
*  Like they did so many training jumps [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1833.44s)]
*  that we can do this when we need to. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1835.2s)]
*  You said that training for SEAL Team Six [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1837.5400000000002s)]
*  was heavily psychological and they make you feel [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1839.96s)]
*  like a loser. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1843.3000000000002s)]
*  They make you fail on purpose. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1844.14s)]
*  What does that consist of and what's the purpose? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1845.28s)]
*  They just wanna see how you handle failure. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1848.88s)]
*  And even when we're training later, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1851.0s)]
*  when we get into SEAL Team Six and a debrief, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1854.44s)]
*  even after a combat mission, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1856.2s)]
*  on a debrief I would say, okay, what did you screw up? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1857.68s)]
*  I don't wanna sit here and listen to how awesome you are. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1860.0800000000002s)]
*  What did you fuck up? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1861.64s)]
*  Tell me and we'll learn from that. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1862.68s)]
*  So they purposely get you in situations that you can't pass [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1864.5600000000002s)]
*  to see just to see like when they asked you, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1868.4s)]
*  what were you thinking? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1871.5600000000002s)]
*  Your answer should be, I'm an idiot. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1872.8400000000001s)]
*  That's it, deflated. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1875.44s)]
*  Don't get in an argument you can't win. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1876.48s)]
*  But the guy that starts to explain, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1878.76s)]
*  well, here's what happened, blah, blah, blah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1879.6000000000001s)]
*  You know, thanks for the debrief, you're out of here. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1880.42s)]
*  I don't wanna hear your excuses. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1882.6000000000001s)]
*  Just you're an idiot, now learn from it. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1885.2s)]
*  So sometimes when people sell products on TV, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1886.44s)]
*  and I love this product, I use this product, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1889.04s)]
*  there's the question in the mind of the viewer, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1891.18s)]
*  does this guy really use the product? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1893.64s)]
*  Does he really love the product? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1895.5s)]
*  Would he keep the product at home? [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1896.88s)]
*  Ask my dogs, yes. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1898.4s)]
*  Now we are in a garage. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1900.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you where it is because again, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1902.88s)]
*  this is prepping, but this is my garage. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1904.96s)]
*  There's a gun safe. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1908.48s)]
*  And this is a part of my stockpile of Ready Hour. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1909.3200000000002s)]
*  Completely real. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1912.8400000000001s)]
*  The second I put it here, the second Ready Hour sent it [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1914.2s)]
*  to me, I felt peace of mind. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1917.3200000000002s)]
*  Because no matter what happens, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1919.76s)]
*  we're not going hungry in my house. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1921.48s)]
*  I moved a lot of fishing gear out of the way [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1923.0s)]
*  to keep it in my garage. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1925.2s)]
*  And ever since it's been here, [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1926.5600000000002s)]
*  I have felt the peace of mind that comes from knowing [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1928.68s)]
*  my family's not going hungry no matter what. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1930.8400000000001s)]

*  Lastcountrysupply.com. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1935.52s)]
*  It can be in your garage along with the peace of mind [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1936.8799999999999s)]
*  that comes with having it. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1938.8799999999999s)]
*  So what would they make you fail? [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1940.68s)]
*  House runs. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1942.6399999999999s)]
*  That's when in a kill house, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1943.48s)]
*  like when a hostage rescue team comes into a house, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1945.32s)]
*  you'll see it in action movies and stuff [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1948.6599999999999s)]
*  where they just come in here and they clear the whole area. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1949.98s)]
*  There are definite steps, distances, movements and angles [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1951.96s)]
*  based on covering each other's backs and fields of fire. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1954.96s)]
*  So each like one man goes here, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1957.68s)]
*  two men goes here, three, four. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1959.08s)]
*  And they just, they make it really, really difficult [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1961.08s)]
*  target identification. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  Like they'll stupid paper targets [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1966.3799999999999s)]
*  where someone's pointing something at you [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1968.04s)]
*  and you shoot them all of a sudden it's just a cell phone. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1969.4399999999998s)]
*  So that's a safety violation, you're probably fired. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1971.28s)]
*  Or they'll have something holding a hostage. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1973.46s)]
*  And if you shoot the wrong person, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1975.4399999999998s)]
*  well, if you shoot the wrong person, you're out. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1976.8s)]
*  But just little footwork stuff or too far off the wall, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1979.0s)]
*  too far, over penetrate, long hallway stairwell. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1982.32s)]
*  Just you screwed something up. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1986.28s)]
*  So they didn't go by the standard operating procedures, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1987.76s)]
*  but they'll let you keep going to see if you... [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1992.08s)]
*  Well, like when you first take a step into a room, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1996.0s)]
*  are you the person who comes into a situation [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=1999.16s)]
*  and makes a mistake and then realize worrying [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2000.92s)]
*  about that mistake right now is not gonna help? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2004.04s)]
*  I have a job to do. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2005.96s)]
*  And we'll talk about that later if we live. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2007.12s)]
*  Or are you the person who comes into a situation, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2008.96s)]
*  makes a mistake and then you can't stop thinking [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2011.0s)]
*  about that mistake. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2012.6s)]
*  And even though you're moving this way [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2013.8s)]
*  to clear that corner, you're dwelling on this mistake. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  And because you can't stop thinking [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2016.88s)]
*  about that mistake over here, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2018.0s)]
*  that's where you make a bigger mistake [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2019.16s)]
*  and that's where they get you. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2020.24s)]
*  And then you're fired. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2021.0800000000002s)]
*  So it's make a mistake, get over it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2022.28s)]
*  And then keep going on. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2024.8400000000001s)]
*  And the house run can be another 20 minutes. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2025.8400000000001s)]
*  And you're still thinking about that first entry point [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2028.96s)]
*  that you screwed up, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2031.3200000000002s)]
*  but you gotta get that out of your head. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2032.28s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2033.44s)]
*  You just get over it. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2034.28s)]
*  I mean, it's simple as just stop thinking about it. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2036.64s)]
*  That no longer matters. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2039.4s)]
*  That we're just here. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2040.52s)]
*  Your failure no longer matters. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2042.0s)]
*  Nope, because I mean, everyone's still alive. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2043.44s)]
*  I screwed up. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2045.44s)]
*  I came in with the wrong foot, whatever. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2046.96s)]
*  So they make you feel incompetent. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2049.44s)]
*  Yes, like every run. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2052.2s)]
*  At the end of it, you get debriefed on how bad you, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2054.64s)]
*  and like the whole like green team [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2057.36s)]
*  that we call it the selection course, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2059.6s)]
*  just telling everyone how they screwed up. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2061.72s)]
*  And then everyone gets punished for it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2062.92s)]
*  And then as soon as you're done getting punished, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2064.72s)]
*  you're right back in there again. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2066.08s)]
*  And the whole point is, can you get over it? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2067.8s)]
*  I mean, that sounds harder than running. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2070.92s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2074.0s)]
*  And I've seen dudes that when they just freeze, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2075.28s)]
*  they screw up too many things and they just freeze. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2078.92s)]
*  Yeah, because it's a perfectionist [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2081.76s)]
*  who gets into this business anyway. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2084.36s)]
*  Like who wants to be a Navy SEAL? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2086.0400000000004s)]
*  Only someone who wants to test himself, be the best, right? [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2087.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2091.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2092.48s)]
*  Someone's got something to prove. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2093.32s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2095.0s)]
*  And they wanna be the best. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2095.84s)]
*  And then, I mean, it's even unique going to SEAL Team Six. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2096.6800000000003s)]
*  It's not everyone knows that SEAL Team Six [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2099.1600000000003s)]
*  is a different animal. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2100.28s)]
*  Like a lot of the Navy SEALs you see out there now [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2101.32s)]
*  weren't at SEAL Team Six. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2103.72s)]
*  And they know that. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2105.56s)]
*  And a lot of people don't talk about it. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2107.0s)]
*  That is the best command in the world. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2109.0s)]
*  Those are the guys that they call [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2113.2799999999997s)]
*  when Osam Bin Laden pops up, SEAL Team Six. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2114.56s)]
*  So how do you, I mean, how do people fail out? [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2117.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, these are all SEALs with five-resistance. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2120.68s)]
*  Just usually safety violations. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2122.3199999999997s)]
*  Like I was talking about, [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2124.52s)]
*  with the wrong foot or shooting the wrong target, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2125.3999999999996s)]
*  you can have minor safety violations or majors. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2127.12s)]
*  If you get a major, they're gonna boot you. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2129.8799999999997s)]
*  But if they like you, they might keep you. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2131.3999999999996s)]
*  Like if they personally like you. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2132.8s)]
*  If they hate you, you're in a bad, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2134.4s)]
*  you're starting off on the wrong foot. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2135.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a point during the screening process [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2137.6800000000003s)]
*  where they just hand your picture around [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2139.8s)]
*  to the guys that have made it. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2141.1200000000003s)]
*  And if you get too many thumbs down, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2143.2400000000002s)]
*  like I've seen this guy, I don't like him. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2144.44s)]
*  You're not gonna, you don't even get to try. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  Like it's a good old- [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2147.6400000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2148.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2149.8s)]
*  Yeah, you wanna- [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2150.6400000000003s)]
*  What percentage is the attrition? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2151.48s)]
*  50%. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2153.4s)]
*  When I went through, half the guys didn't make it. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2154.44s)]
*  And you knew them all, I assume. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2156.8s)]
*  Oh, I knew all of them. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2157.8s)]
*  And it was just bizarre because [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2158.6400000000003s)]
*  one minute you're having breakfast with your buddy, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2160.5600000000004s)]
*  and there were guys I had breakfast with, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2162.68s)]
*  and I never saw them again in my life. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2164.2799999999997s)]
*  They did something wrong, they're out. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2165.4399999999996s)]
*  They would walk around with the instructors, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2167.4399999999996s)]
*  and they're all SEAL Team Six guys, these instructors. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  They've been through this course. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2171.3999999999996s)]
*  They'd walk around with like two airplane tickets [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2172.8399999999997s)]
*  back in the day when you'd have paper tickets. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2174.7999999999997s)]
*  They'd be like, all right, [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2176.7599999999998s)]
*  we're not done until two of you guys go home. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2177.6s)]
*  So we're gonna keep training until two of you guys fail. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2179.52s)]
*  Like it's a tough course. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2182.24s)]
*  How long is it? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2184.0s)]
*  Nine months. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2184.8799999999997s)]
*  Nine months? [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2185.9599999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2186.7799999999997s)]
*  Does anyone fail out at the end? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2187.62s)]
*  Not usually. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2189.08s)]
*  When you get through the initial part [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2189.92s)]
*  of close quarters battle, they keep you around. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2192.12s)]
*  The initial down in Tennessee, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2194.6800000000003s)]
*  or not in Tennessee, in Arkin. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2196.36s)]
*  Where the hell are we? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2199.12s)]
*  Mississippi. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2199.96s)]
*  If you make it through that and jumping, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2200.88s)]
*  they'll usually keep you around [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2202.12s)]
*  because you've proven you can do that stuff. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2203.0s)]
*  Plus they spent a lot of money on you. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2204.32s)]
*  So they might keep you around. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2206.28s)]
*  But you can get shit can at any time, too, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2207.2400000000002s)]
*  when you're at the command. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2209.04s)]
*  If you screw up, they can, we can. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2211.8s)]
*  So you graduate, you become part of SEAL Team Six. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2213.6s)]
*  You made it to the top. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2216.7200000000003s)]
*  What do they do with you next? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2217.6800000000003s)]
*  They split us up into squadrons. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2219.36s)]
*  And they're just, you go from being a number team [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2220.88s)]
*  to a color team. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2224.94s)]
*  So like I was at SEAL Team Two, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2225.78s)]
*  and then I went to SEAL Team Six Red Squadron. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2227.32s)]
*  So I was at Red. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2228.96s)]
*  And it's even funny out in town. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2230.2000000000003s)]
*  Like you see some of the local groupies [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2231.6800000000003s)]
*  and they would talk to SEALs like, number or color? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2233.52s)]
*  It's like, first of all, fuck you. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2235.92s)]
*  But second of all, red. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2237.94s)]
*  Are there better colors than others? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2240.48s)]
*  No, it is funny that, no. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2242.1200000000003s)]
*  When you get to that level, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2244.76s)]
*  everyone is on the same level. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2245.92s)]
*  There's different attitudes, personalities. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2248.6s)]
*  Like Red Team was known for training way too hard. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2254.12s)]
*  Gold Team was known for telling people to F off, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2256.36s)]
*  like you can't tell us what to do. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2258.16s)]
*  And Blue was awesome. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2259.48s)]
*  When we finally started silver, this is kind of funny. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2260.8399999999997s)]
*  Because Delta was gonna go to four squadrons. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2263.2s)]
*  So we went to four squadrons. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2264.72s)]
*  And the rumor that Gold Squadron started was, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2266.2799999999997s)]
*  yeah, I heard the next one's gonna be Silver Squadron. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2268.68s)]
*  And that rumor just started and it turned into silver. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2271.3199999999997s)]
*  And we finally asked Gold, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2273.36s)]
*  why did you keep saying it was silver? [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2274.3199999999997s)]
*  And they go, because silver is not quite as good as gold. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2276.08s)]
*  Second place. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2279.48s)]
*  Yeah, but no, I did one deployment with silver also. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2280.3199999999997s)]
*  And the guys are just the best of the best. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2282.68s)]
*  How many are there in SEAL Team Six? [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2285.68s)]
*  About 200, I think at any time. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2287.12s)]
*  And that was a unique place [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2288.96s)]
*  because I was excited to get out of bed. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2289.96s)]
*  Because every day I can go to work [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2292.2999999999997s)]
*  with people who are better than me. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2293.64s)]
*  And we all thought that way. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2295.4s)]
*  We all acted that way. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2297.56s)]
*  And nobody ever undermined anybody else. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2298.96s)]
*  Like if someone was out shooting me, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2302.44s)]
*  like in a speed drill, I'd go up to them and say, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2304.0s)]
*  why did you switch your holster to here? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2307.4s)]
*  Why did you put that pouch over here? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2309.1200000000003s)]
*  What time do you wake up [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2311.32s)]
*  and what workout do you do in the morning? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2312.1600000000003s)]
*  What do you eat? [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2313.36s)]
*  I wanna find out what you're doing to make, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2314.2000000000003s)]
*  what made you better than me today? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2315.94s)]
*  And try to get better. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2317.6400000000003s)]
*  And then we'd help each other. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2318.48s)]
*  Instead of like trying to steal their job or whatever, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2319.48s)]
*  we'd help each other. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2321.2000000000003s)]
*  And then when we, I mean, at that level, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2322.52s)]
*  when we first started going to Iraq, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2325.0s)]
*  because I'd only seen Iraq on television. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2326.28s)]
*  Suicide bombers everywhere, car bombs going. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2329.0s)]
*  Like the first three months in Iraq, [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2330.92s)]
*  I was like, are we missing something? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2333.2000000000003s)]
*  Because we're really good. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2335.68s)]
*  Like we're, this isn't even close. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2337.12s)]
*  The enemy's not even getting a shot off. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2338.72s)]
*  We got to a point where we stopped blowing up doors [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2340.56s)]
*  and stopped talking to each other and went quiet, went silent. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  Like if we were silent, we were faster. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2347.3599999999997s)]
*  And we got to a point where instead of blowing up a door [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2349.96s)]
*  and waking, instead of landing a helicopter [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2352.3199999999997s)]
*  right on the house, we'd land way over there, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2353.72s)]
*  walk in, pick the locks, break the glass quietly, go in. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  We would have competitions on who could touch more terrorists [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2358.3199999999997s)]
*  while they were sleeping. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2360.7999999999997s)]
*  Like walk up to them and you like to test their vest [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2362.16s)]
*  for a suicide vest. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2364.4s)]
*  And then you put your hand on their lips and go, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2366.4s)]
*  and you wake them up. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2368.7200000000003s)]
*  And then they shit their pants. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2370.12s)]
*  And then what happens? [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2371.92s)]
*  You arrest them. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2373.04s)]
*  Unless they have a suicide vest on them. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2373.88s)]
*  They find out if the 72 virgins are real. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2375.84s)]
*  When was the first time you saw someone killed as a SEAL? [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2378.92s)]
*  Do you remember? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2382.8s)]
*  I want to say in Ramadi. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2383.64s)]
*  I didn't, no, because we dropped bombs on people in 2005 [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2386.32s)]
*  and then I went to Iraq in 2000, late 2005. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2391.2s)]
*  And that's the first time I killed someone. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2395.3999999999996s)]
*  Me and actually the sniper from the Captain Phillips mission, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2397.64s)]
*  we got our kills at the exact same time. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2401.56s)]
*  What happened? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2403.7599999999998s)]
*  We were doing a combined hit with, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2404.6s)]
*  it was SEAL Team Six, Delta Force, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2408.52s)]
*  and the Special Air Service. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2410.04s)]
*  So we got a good crew coming in [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2411.6s)]
*  and we're splitting up this, like SAS says, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2413.8399999999997s)]
*  this Delta's got this and here's our target. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2416.48s)]
*  And we crept in. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2417.9199999999996s)]
*  We had just started that tactic of not going on white lights, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2419.56s)]
*  not moving fast, going dark, not talking. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2422.52s)]
*  Like when I see people at war just screaming, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2424.84s)]
*  go, go, go, all that bullshit, it's like, shut up. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2427.0s)]
*  Why aren't you just yelling, here we are, just shut up. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2429.52s)]
*  And like, if you point this way, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2432.04s)]
*  I'll assume you see something [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2433.16s)]
*  and we can just read off each other. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2434.08s)]
*  So we went into this house, four of us, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2435.84s)]
*  one of the guys was from the SBS, Special Boat Service, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2437.92s)]
*  and we're walking down this long hallway, four of us, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2440.24s)]
*  and this dude came out with an AK [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2442.2799999999997s)]
*  and he could have killed all of us, but he couldn't see us. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2444.84s)]
*  So he went back in the room [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2447.36s)]
*  and then we hit the room and killed him. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2448.48s)]
*  Then we came outside as the whole town started to light up [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2450.4s)]
*  and me and the sniper went out [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2453.16s)]
*  and we did this cross pan thing on a building. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2454.68s)]
*  And as like when you're crossing, like I'm covering here, [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2457.2000000000003s)]
*  he's covering there, and you can wave [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2459.0s)]
*  and take your corner or whatever. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2460.52s)]
*  But these two dudes just popped up, two al-Qaeda guys. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2462.44s)]
*  I blasted him, he blasted him. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2464.28s)]
*  And I go, oh shit, I just killed that guy. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2466.52s)]
*  And my buddy goes, I just killed that guy. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2467.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm like, what do we do now? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2469.28s)]
*  And I guess we do one of those bounding things [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2470.12s)]
*  and find more al-Qaeda guys. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2471.48s)]
*  But it was almost like the first kill wasn't, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2473.64s)]
*  it didn't bother me. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2478.6s)]
*  It was more of a, okay, now I'm part of the club. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2479.76s)]
*  Cause now I have friends that have kills, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2482.08s)]
*  now I have a kill. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2483.16s)]
*  And then the flood gates opened [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2484.48s)]
*  and everyone started killing people. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2486.2400000000002s)]
*  When was it? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2488.36s)]
*  It was 2005? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2489.2000000000003s)]
*  2006 and 2007 was when it really got hot. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2490.44s)]
*  And then over in Afghanistan. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2492.44s)]
*  Did you, that night after you killed somebody, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2494.32s)]
*  did you think about it? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2496.7200000000003s)]
*  Not really. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2498.88s)]
*  No, I mean, it was just a kill. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2500.68s)]
*  It was everyone's trying to get there. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2501.92s)]
*  Everyone's trying to do it. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2504.68s)]
*  So I'm just part of the club. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2505.6s)]
*  It didn't bother me at all. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2506.44s)]
*  And again, just working with these guys, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2507.8s)]
*  I thought I was different mindset. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2509.1600000000003s)]
*  So it didn't, and that guy still doesn't bother me. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2511.32s)]
*  He had a gun, he was maneuvering on us or whatever. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2513.1600000000003s)]
*  He was definitely al-Qaeda. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2514.7200000000003s)]
*  And then, we just did that [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2516.7200000000003s)]
*  and we were really good about it. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2518.48s)]
*  The more latitude that we had, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  as far as collateral damage, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2522.6800000000003s)]
*  the fewer innocent people got hurt [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2524.0800000000004s)]
*  because we're the good guys. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2526.0s)]
*  And we're not going in there to murder people. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2527.84s)]
*  And if you give me that, then, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2529.88s)]
*  but then, I mean, it got to the point. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2531.88s)]
*  Right before I got out, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2534.04s)]
*  if you're in a gunfight and there's a cave, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2535.32s)]
*  I remember one, there was a cave, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2537.0s)]
*  we're trying to call in hell fires. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2538.12s)]
*  And the boss is 200 miles away, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2539.24s)]
*  said, we're not saying there are women and children [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2541.44s)]
*  in that cave, but we can't prove that there are not. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2543.88s)]
*  It's like, what are we even doing here? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2545.96s)]
*  But we got good at it. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2547.84s)]
*  Every night we're going out and we, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2549.56s)]
*  General McChrystal decided [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2552.88s)]
*  that we should be hunting Sunni terrorists. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2554.24s)]
*  That's what al-Qaeda, they're Sunnis. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2556.64s)]
*  And they were terrorizing the locals. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2558.2s)]
*  And that's kind of where I got an affinity for locals [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2560.24s)]
*  because they got to deal with us, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2561.92s)]
*  then they got to deal with al-Qaeda. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2563.44s)]
*  All they're trying to do is get on with their lives. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2564.48s)]
*  Most people in a combat zone are not combatants. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2566.04s)]
*  They just want to live. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2568.84s)]
*  And so they deal with al-Qaeda in their house. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2569.6800000000003s)]
*  But so then we would go to their house. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2571.6800000000003s)]
*  And then that's when we got into interrogations, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2572.84s)]
*  try to find the bad guys and root them out. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2574.6800000000003s)]
*  And we were given the latitude to, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2576.32s)]
*  if you see a kill them on site. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2578.2400000000002s)]
*  How would you know who they were? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2580.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, usually if they go to their guns [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2582.6800000000003s)]
*  or they sleep outside with guns buried, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2585.2000000000003s)]
*  you can kind of tell they're bad guys. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2588.52s)]
*  And if they don't have guns, we don't kill them, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  even though we know they should be. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2592.32s)]
*  But again, we're the good guys. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2594.1600000000003s)]
*  So we're not trying to do that, [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2595.4s)]
*  but they'll usually hop up and fight. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2596.64s)]
*  Or then the trees are on the, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2599.64s)]
*  get shot at from rooftops and things like that. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2600.88s)]
*  But interrogating them was actually funny. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2603.76s)]
*  I mean- [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2605.92s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2606.76s)]
*  The way I started to do it, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2608.0s)]
*  cause I never had training, we just learned on the job. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2609.48s)]
*  And so what I would do is I would take my interpreter [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2612.2400000000002s)]
*  and like have him stand here [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2614.64s)]
*  and put the al-Qaeda guy right in front of him. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2615.6800000000003s)]
*  So they can't look at each other, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2617.28s)]
*  but I talk to him and he talks to you. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2618.32s)]
*  And then you tell me what he says. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2620.92s)]
*  And I'm going to be very direct. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2622.52s)]
*  I'm just going to ask, who's the man of the house? [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2623.84s)]
*  How many guys are here? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2626.76s)]
*  What are their names? [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2627.6000000000004s)]
*  What's your name? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2628.42s)]
*  And then let them go. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2629.32s)]
*  But then like I've run in- [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2630.6000000000004s)]
*  Why do you ask that? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2632.1600000000003s)]
*  Cause if there's seven, usually it's like a rule of threes. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2634.0s)]
*  Like if there's seven dudes, there's going to be 21 women, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2636.28s)]
*  16, God knows how many kids. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2639.6400000000003s)]
*  So the guys are the bad guys. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2641.92s)]
*  And so if there's seven dudes, five of them are going to be, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2643.44s)]
*  they live in the house and those two are, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2646.28s)]
*  they came in from Jordan, that's al-Qaeda. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  And just separate them, then you arrest them [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2649.6000000000004s)]
*  and bring them back to prison and stuff [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2650.76s)]
*  and they can interrogate them there. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2652.64s)]
*  So you look for the, you look for contradictions. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2654.2s)]
*  You ask them all separately. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2657.08s)]
*  Cause the two guys are lying. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2658.24s)]
*  They don't know who the guys in the house are. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2659.24s)]
*  They don't know their names or how many people are here. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2660.4s)]
*  The five guys that live here do. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2662.16s)]
*  And then, then the one that I really liked [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2664.52s)]
*  was like the 12 year old kid, the boy, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2666.4s)]
*  the oldest of the children, because you could, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2668.56s)]
*  you could prop him up, like dust him off and say, all right, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2670.92s)]
*  finally I'm talking to the man of the house. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2673.4s)]
*  What's going on here? [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2674.7599999999998s)]
*  Who are these dudes? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2675.58s)]
*  And then he just, yeah, I am the man of the house. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2676.42s)]
*  Well, these two are assholes. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2677.92s)]
*  So I was like, all right, cool. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2678.7599999999998s)]
*  Or even bring them in a place where they can't see him. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2680.24s)]
*  Like put them behind a sheet or something. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2683.48s)]
*  And I'll bring these guys in and you just point to the, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2684.84s)]
*  like a lineup on TV. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2687.2s)]
*  And then those, those are the bad guys [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2689.08s)]
*  and they don't know who the kid is. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2690.36s)]
*  And then you just roll them up that way. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2692.0s)]
*  And I mean, it sucks. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2693.36s)]
*  Cause then you send them to prison. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2694.2s)]
*  They're out in 30 days. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2695.02s)]
*  You're fighting them again. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2695.86s)]
*  Where, where, where was the prison? [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2697.0s)]
*  Abu Ghraib, usually in Iraq. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2698.16s)]
*  And then Bagram we take in there. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2700.08s)]
*  We sent a few guys to Guantanamo. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2702.08s)]
*  You know, that was, but at the time too, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2705.52s)]
*  it's almost like it's, we were at a time [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2707.0s)]
*  where we're just fighting for the guy next to me. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2710.24s)]
*  The overall plan, like Bin Laden's a ghost. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2711.76s)]
*  We're never going to find him. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2713.6400000000003s)]
*  Like I would even joke with dudes I was interrogating. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2714.84s)]
*  Like who's the man of the house? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2716.92s)]
*  Whose house is this? [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2718.4s)]
*  Where's Osama Bin Laden? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2719.2400000000002s)]
*  And I'd see terrorists laugh at me. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2720.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2721.28s)]
*  Like, I know you don't know. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2722.6000000000004s)]
*  I don't know either. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2723.44s)]
*  I just figured I'd ask. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2724.26s)]
*  But like I've run into English speakers where like, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2725.32s)]
*  like he didn't need the interpreter. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2730.5200000000004s)]
*  And he'd say, I know the deal. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2732.44s)]
*  I remember one guy said, I go, you know the deal? [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2734.8s)]
*  He's like, yeah, I know the deal. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2737.5600000000004s)]
*  You're going to send me to prison. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2738.4s)]
*  I'm going to get out in 30 days. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2739.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm going to kill your friends again. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2740.0800000000004s)]
*  And I said, so you've dealt with Americans before, huh? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2741.08s)]
*  And he's like, yeah. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2743.64s)]
*  I'm like, did they look like me? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2744.48s)]
*  Like with the beard, short sleeves, tattoos? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2746.04s)]
*  Do they look like me? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2748.32s)]
*  You didn't, you never dealt with us. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2749.48s)]
*  We're not here on accident. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2752.12s)]
*  We're here for you. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2753.04s)]
*  And then again, watch Al Qaeda shit their pants. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2754.7599999999998s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2756.96s)]
*  I mean, what a heavy life though. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2758.16s)]
*  I mean, it was, but everyone was doing it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2760.44s)]
*  So it seemed normal. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2763.08s)]
*  What did you ever talk about it? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2764.24s)]
*  I mean, you're just the people you're, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2765.92s)]
*  the guys you're working with sound like smart people. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2769.08s)]
*  I mean, they're screened for intelligence and self control. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2771.72s)]
*  And like, they're not shallow people. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2776.08s)]
*  No, right. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2777.7599999999998s)]
*  No, they're deep thinkers. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2778.6s)]
*  I can tell. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2779.44s)]
*  But just be like everyone around you is doing it. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2780.48s)]
*  So it seems normal. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2784.16s)]
*  It was not uncommon to see a guy at the team [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2785.0s)]
*  that just made headlines around the world and say, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2788.56s)]
*  Hey dude, you just made headlines. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2790.08s)]
*  Cool. You want to go to the gym? [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2791.16s)]
*  Like just blow it off. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2792.64s)]
*  When my buddy rescue or rescued Richard Phillips, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2794.4s)]
*  and we were on the ship and I said, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2797.64s)]
*  this is obviously before the bit. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2799.04s)]
*  Can you explain the Richard Phillips story [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2800.24s)]
*  for those who don't remember? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2801.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was the Marist Alabama was a ship carrying crate [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2802.56s)]
*  around the Horn of Africa. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2808.16s)]
*  And Somali pirates had started taking the ships as criminals [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2809.88s)]
*  because the insurance company is always paying [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2813.56s)]
*  the ransom every time. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2816.12s)]
*  So it's going to be a lucrative business. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2817.56s)]
*  And they captured the Marist Alabama [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2819.92s)]
*  and Richard Phillips was a captain in order to save his crew. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2823.56s)]
*  And then there was a fight on board. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2826.48s)]
*  He got in a lifeboat and then the four terrorist criminals [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2827.8s)]
*  got in a lifeboat and then they went off to sea [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2830.88s)]
*  because he was going to just send them out. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  But they took him as a prisoner [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2834.2400000000002s)]
*  because they could sell them to Al Shabaab [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2835.68s)]
*  or whatever they're going to do. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2836.8s)]
*  And eventually the USS Bainbridge, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2838.32s)]
*  a destroyer started towing it. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2842.32s)]
*  So they're towing this around, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2843.96s)]
*  not sure what to do with them. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2846.28s)]
*  That you got terrorists inside there [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2847.64s)]
*  and an American prisoner. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2848.92s)]
*  I mean, even to the point that he jumped out once [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2850.4s)]
*  and he was looking at the Navy, like, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2852.92s)]
*  are you going to go hot? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2854.2400000000002s)]
*  Like you can go shoot now because I'm in the water [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2855.28s)]
*  and they didn't even shoot. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2857.0400000000004s)]
*  Like you're putting his life at risk [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2857.88s)]
*  because if they get him back, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2859.96s)]
*  so they tied him up and all that stuff. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2861.1600000000003s)]
*  And then that's when they called us. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2862.36s)]
*  And I was, it was my birthday, Good Friday, April 10th. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2863.88s)]
*  And I was at my daughter's Easter tea party [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2867.5600000000004s)]
*  at her preschool and I'm getting her cupcakes. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2869.32s)]
*  I got a pink plate and I walked over to, [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2871.88s)]
*  she's four years old and I got a message that [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2873.4s)]
*  you're going to get them now. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2875.32s)]
*  So I had to kiss my daughter, like look her in the eye. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2876.96s)]
*  Like that's the hardest part too of combat. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2879.0s)]
*  Look her in the eyes and kind of realize this could be it. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2880.88s)]
*  This could be the last time we ever see each other. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2885.04s)]
*  You know, and there's a huge difference [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2887.36s)]
*  between kissing your kid goodnight [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2888.32s)]
*  and kissing your kid goodbye. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2889.44s)]
*  And she was always there. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2891.24s)]
*  Like she was four during that one. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2892.32s)]
*  She was one after Lone Survivor. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2893.92s)]
*  She was seven going after Bin Laden. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2895.92s)]
*  But saying goodbye to her, giving her a kiss and then, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2897.96s)]
*  well, we had a set amount of time to get to work. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2901.56s)]
*  We've been selling it since 1980, but we'd never done it. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2905.36s)]
*  And I have about an hour to get- [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2908.24s)]
*  Selling it to- [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2909.64s)]
*  Selling that we can be wheels up at a certain time [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2910.48s)]
*  and we can be anywhere in the world in 24 hours. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2912.52s)]
*  We've been selling it to like JSOC, [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2914.44s)]
*  the army and the White House. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2915.84s)]
*  And you got to figure the Obama administration [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2917.36s)]
*  had only been in office for a few months. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2919.04s)]
*  So this is very serious, but the funny part of the story [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2921.2400000000002s)]
*  was I was ahead of schedule and I stopped at a 7-Eleven [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2924.76s)]
*  on the way, there's a 7-Eleven outside of the base. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2928.0s)]
*  And I got a log of Copenhagen, a carton of cigarettes [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2930.12s)]
*  and as much cash as I could out of the ATM. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2933.12s)]
*  That's the spirit. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2934.92s)]
*  Because I knew we're going to be jumping [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2935.76s)]
*  on the East coast of Africa, [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2937.2400000000002s)]
*  but there's never a perfect plan. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2938.28s)]
*  We might not land where we want. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2940.16s)]
*  I'm the lead jumper and we might not end up where we want. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2941.6s)]
*  But if I land in a semi-permissive environment, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2944.96s)]
*  I might be able to barter with the locals with the tobacco [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2947.04s)]
*  or pay my way to safety with cash. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2949.68s)]
*  What brand of cigarettes? [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2952.56s)]
*  I bought Parliament Lights. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2953.8799999999997s)]
*  Parliament Lights? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2955.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2957.0s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2957.8399999999997s)]
*  But I was in there to get it and there was one dude, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2958.68s)]
*  there was one dude in front of me [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2961.16s)]
*  and he was buying a USA Today [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2962.56s)]
*  and the headline was about Richard Phillips, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2964.3599999999997s)]
*  about the mission we're trying to do. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2966.48s)]
*  I'm right behind him and he slammed it down on the counter [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2968.64s)]
*  and kind of announced to the whole store, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2971.16s)]
*  that someone would do something about this. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2972.96s)]
*  And I'm behind him recognizing the irony [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2975.76s)]
*  and looking at my watch and I tap him on the shoulder [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2977.84s)]
*  and he turns around and I go, [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2980.36s)]
*  buddy, pay for your shit and we will. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2981.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, I'm not even kidding. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2982.96s)]
*  The national security timeline is squarely [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2984.32s)]
*  on your very broad shoulders. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2986.28s)]
*  Did you make it within? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2987.52s)]
*  Yeah, I made it in time and then 15 hours and 46 minutes [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2988.36s)]
*  after I got the message, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2991.52s)]
*  we were in the Indian Ocean with 103 guys, full head count. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2993.28s)]
*  And then a day and a half later on Easter. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2996.52s)]
*  How'd you get in the Indian Ocean? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2998.36s)]
*  We jumped out of the C-17. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=2999.6s)]
*  We flew from Oceania, refueled, [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3000.84s)]
*  and then I led the jump out. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3002.8s)]
*  And we had a dude behind me that, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3004.32s)]
*  he wasn't a SEAL and he didn't have any skydives, [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3006.88s)]
*  but he was a communicator. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3008.96s)]
*  He set up the radio so we could talk to the White House, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3010.32s)]
*  but then we're like, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3012.36s)]
*  we might need better communication when we get down there. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3013.2000000000003s)]
*  So I'll handle this. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3014.84s)]
*  And I went over and kind of kicked him and said, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3016.4s)]
*  hey, huge change in plans, homie. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3017.6s)]
*  Guess who gets the skydive? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3020.28s)]
*  And he's like, oh no, I didn't join the Navy to be a SEAL. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3021.84s)]
*  I don't want to skydive. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3024.0s)]
*  And I was like, you're half right. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3024.84s)]
*  Have a nice jump. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3025.76s)]
*  And so we jumped- [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3027.44s)]
*  You told him on the plane that he's jumping out over there. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3028.28s)]
*  You're gonna strap up to my buddy here [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3030.36s)]
*  and he's gonna jump. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3031.68s)]
*  Well, that was a funny story too, [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3032.52s)]
*  because I'm on the ramp. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3033.56s)]
*  We just launched the boats. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3034.96s)]
*  I'm the lead jumper. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3036.6s)]
*  I'm the first guy to bring the guys down. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3037.44s)]
*  I turn around at the end is this poor kid [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3039.16s)]
*  doing his first tandem. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3041.9199999999996s)]
*  And before I jump, I'm in a great mood, right? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3043.2s)]
*  Because I hooked him up. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3045.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm a tandem master, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3046.56s)]
*  so I'm doing the personnel inspection on him. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3047.3999999999996s)]
*  He's just the radio guy. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3049.2s)]
*  He's a radio guy. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3050.16s)]
*  And I could have ordered him to go, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3051.0s)]
*  but I'm like in a good mood. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3053.04s)]
*  And I'm like, dude, chicks pay for the shit on the weekends [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3054.16s)]
*  and that water's like 90 degrees. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3056.2s)]
*  This is gorgeous. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3057.44s)]
*  It's gonna be so fun. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3058.2799999999997s)]
*  And he's scared to death. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3059.1s)]
*  So I'm getting ready to jump [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3060.04s)]
*  and I turn around and I kind of give him a thumbs up [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3061.0s)]
*  and I'm getting nothing. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3063.96s)]
*  And my buddy who I connected him to, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3065.08s)]
*  his head comes around and kind of gives me a thumbs up. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3066.68s)]
*  And then this kid looks back [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3069.12s)]
*  and they're in each other's intimate space. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3070.32s)]
*  And the last thing I heard my buddy say was, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3072.2400000000002s)]
*  well, don't look at me, bro. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3073.84s)]
*  I don't know what half this shit does anyway [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3074.68s)]
*  before he jumped him. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3076.56s)]
*  And then we had, so we jumped in. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3077.8s)]
*  So the kid actually went out the plane? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3079.12s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3080.48s)]
*  He stayed scared the whole mission. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3081.32s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3082.8s)]
*  Yeah, but then it ended on Easter. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3083.64s)]
*  So you land in the water. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3085.88s)]
*  Land in the water, sink the parachutes. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3086.88s)]
*  We sent four boats out. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3089.32s)]
*  So we hop on the boats and we go to the USS Boxer. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3090.24s)]
*  And then we put the snipers on the Bainbridge [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3093.64s)]
*  and then we were coming up with plans [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3095.16s)]
*  because no one had thought of a lifeboat [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3096.68s)]
*  being towed by a destroyer. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3099.04s)]
*  So literally everyone come up with a plan [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3100.4799999999996s)]
*  and we'll write them down and we'll come up with the top five. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3102.08s)]
*  And as we're doing that, the snipers got a good look. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3103.8799999999997s)]
*  They were looking at them for a while [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3106.6s)]
*  and they got the shots and they just took it. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3107.9599999999996s)]
*  And yeah, and one of the stories, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3110.08s)]
*  I don't know if it's true because I wasn't with him, [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3113.3199999999997s)]
*  but his story is awesome. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3114.9599999999996s)]
*  One of the snipers, there's an obstacle [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3116.72s)]
*  in SEAL training called the slide for life, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3119.6s)]
*  where you climb this structure and then you slide [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3121.4s)]
*  on top of a rope all the way down. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3123.16s)]
*  And we always thought, what's the application, [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3125.04s)]
*  the reality of it, when are we ever gonna need this? [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3128.16s)]
*  That one guy needed it that one time [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3130.88s)]
*  when he crawled down to rescue Richard Phillips. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3132.32s)]
*  So he crawled down there. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3134.4s)]
*  And again, this is his story. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3135.72s)]
*  He said he pulled his pistol and he's getting ready [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3136.72s)]
*  to go in that small hatch in the back [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3138.68s)]
*  and just being an arrogant Navy SEAL, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3140.64s)]
*  he's like, this is the only time [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3142.24s)]
*  I'm gonna rescue someone. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3143.32s)]
*  I gotta think of something cool to say. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3144.24s)]
*  What do I say? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3145.32s)]
*  SEAL team here to get you out, whatever. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3146.16s)]
*  He said he went in there [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3147.56s)]
*  and now he's in this lifeboat, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3148.64s)]
*  they've been using it for a toilet for five days [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3151.8399999999997s)]
*  and it's in this hot African sun. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3154.04s)]
*  And now there's three dudes laying in it [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3156.8399999999997s)]
*  with their heads blown off. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3158.64s)]
*  And he said, he looked at Richard Phillips [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3159.8399999999997s)]
*  and the first thing he said was, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3161.52s)]
*  I'm gonna need therapy after this shit. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3162.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what I say. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3165.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna need therapy. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3167.8799999999997s)]
*  Did he? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3169.24s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3170.08s)]
*  And I don't know if he had said that, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3170.92s)]
*  but the story is awesome. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3171.74s)]
*  It's... [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3172.58s)]
*  Was there, I mean, to crawl into a latrine [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3175.06s)]
*  filled with guys who had their heads blown off, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3179.7799999999997s)]
*  pretty heavy thing to see. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3182.7799999999997s)]
*  It is. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3184.54s)]
*  What I was getting at though was when my buddy did that [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3185.58s)]
*  and I talked to him afterwards [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3188.42s)]
*  and they did a really good job in the movie, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3190.86s)]
*  the sniper shoot and they just, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3192.38s)]
*  they put their bipods up and they leave. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3193.38s)]
*  I talked to my buddy and I said, you realize it, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3194.8199999999997s)]
*  you've just done the most important thing [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3196.58s)]
*  in the history of the SEAL teams. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3198.58s)]
*  And his response was, cool, can we go home? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3200.34s)]
*  How long did it take you to get home? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3203.54s)]
*  About two weeks. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3204.54s)]
*  We went to Cutter and hung out at the pool for two weeks. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3205.38s)]
*  Karaoke night, R&R. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3209.74s)]
*  What a weird life. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3211.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, yeah, well, because we never, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3212.74s)]
*  because we'd never done that mission before. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3215.18s)]
*  We'd been selling it since the 80s. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3216.8199999999997s)]
*  And that actually reminds me of the mindset, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3219.5s)]
*  because getting to SEAL Team Six, the mindset, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3221.54s)]
*  those snipers were sleeping in their own beds [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3224.86s)]
*  on a long weekend. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3227.48s)]
*  And they're guns that not need to be sighted in [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3229.16s)]
*  for the most difficult shots of their lives, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3231.62s)]
*  but their guns were sighted in [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3233.2999999999997s)]
*  for the most difficult shots of their lives. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3234.2599999999998s)]
*  If they would have, they didn't get complacent. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3236.14s)]
*  Complacency kills. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3240.14s)]
*  Complacency is caused by success. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3241.06s)]
*  Too much success and you have a tendency [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3243.22s)]
*  to say the worst thing you can say [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3244.54s)]
*  when you're running a team. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3245.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, this is the way we've always done it. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3246.62s)]
*  Those guys could have said, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3248.22s)]
*  I'm gonna sight my gun in on Tuesday. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3249.06s)]
*  I can drink beer all weekend. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3250.7799999999997s)]
*  And that's a shortcut, that's being complacent. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3252.2999999999997s)]
*  And they weren't complacent and it saved a man's life. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3254.1s)]
*  Those shots, I mean, they're shooting through a window [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3256.62s)]
*  and two moving boats. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3259.3s)]
*  There's some serious, and if they miss, [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3261.7000000000003s)]
*  they're gonna kill him right away. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3263.7000000000003s)]
*  Like if you miss this shot, he's gonna execute, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3265.8s)]
*  and it's on you. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3267.86s)]
*  And that's a lot of pressure. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3269.1800000000003s)]
*  How do you hit something when both [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3270.6600000000003s)]
*  the object you're standing on and the object [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3275.6600000000003s)]
*  the target is standing on are moving? [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3278.26s)]
*  They've done it 10,000 times in training. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3280.34s)]
*  They muscle memory. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3282.38s)]
*  Shooting at movers, walkers, cars, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3285.5s)]
*  shooting in wind when someone's walking, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3288.34s)]
*  like having a moving target in wind. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3290.1400000000003s)]
*  So it almost like you're shooting behind him, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3292.06s)]
*  you know the wind's gonna take it into him. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3293.42s)]
*  Anticipating what the sea state is like [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3295.42s)]
*  and you're leading them. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3298.26s)]
*  I didn't take the shot, it was just awesome shots. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3300.06s)]
*  They were, yeah, they were pros, really good dudes. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3302.5s)]
*  So how long between that mission and? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3305.42s)]
*  Bin Laden, two years. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  What'd you do for that two years? [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3310.46s)]
*  As soon as Captain Phillips was done, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3312.06s)]
*  we went over to Afghanistan and I was on the base [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3315.1400000000003s)]
*  when Bo Bergdahl walked off. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3317.74s)]
*  And so we tried to rescue him. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3319.9399999999996s)]
*  That's a weird story too. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3321.3799999999997s)]
*  Cause I, wherever you are, be there, be present. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3323.14s)]
*  And I happened to find myself on all these major missions [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3326.9399999999996s)]
*  just cause I was available. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3329.5s)]
*  I've had army guys joke with me. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3331.2999999999997s)]
*  They said that I'm the Forrest Gump of the Navy, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3332.7799999999997s)]
*  only I'm not as good looking and I can't run as fast. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3335.14s)]
*  I'm not sure how to take that. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3337.9399999999996s)]
*  But Bo Bergdahl walked off. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3339.54s)]
*  Cause the way that we would work overseas is we say. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3341.8199999999997s)]
*  Who is Bo Bergdahl? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3343.8199999999997s)]
*  Bo Bergdahl was the guy that the Taliban grabbed him [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3344.74s)]
*  and they held him for five years in Pakistan. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3347.14s)]
*  And then the army flew in and traded out [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3349.62s)]
*  those five Taliban guys for Bo Bergdahl. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3351.7s)]
*  So he was a POW, but he walked off cause he was an idiot. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3353.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3356.58s)]
*  And the way that we would work. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3357.62s)]
*  He walked over to the Taliban. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3358.9s)]
*  He walked out just because he was gonna start [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3360.06s)]
*  a new life in the mountains. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3361.9s)]
*  And he, it's one of those things where [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3362.7799999999997s)]
*  just because you don't think you're at war with someone [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3364.98s)]
*  doesn't mean they're not at war with you. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3366.7s)]
*  Well, exactly. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3368.18s)]
*  When he walked off the base, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3369.02s)]
*  I went into the tactical operations center with a coffee [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3370.62s)]
*  and they said, yeah, this dude just walked off the base. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3372.66s)]
*  And I was like, he walked off. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3374.54s)]
*  He said, yeah, we intercepted this phone call [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3376.5s)]
*  from the locals calling the Taliban. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3378.06s)]
*  They said, we found this American soldier. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3380.1s)]
*  Do you want him? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3382.02s)]
*  And they said, the Taliban said, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3383.42s)]
*  what do you mean you found him? [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3384.86s)]
*  They go, they said, we found him on the side of the road [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3385.7s)]
*  taking a shit. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3388.02s)]
*  And the Taliban's response was, yeah, we want him. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3388.86s)]
*  And he'll never shit right again. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3390.62s)]
*  And that, like that dude was held for five years. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3392.94s)]
*  And I've been asked before too, should he do jail time? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3395.58s)]
*  It's like, no, he needs therapy because he's been punished. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3398.66s)]
*  He realized he made a huge mistake. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3401.3s)]
*  Whatever happened to him? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3403.3s)]
*  Do you know? [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3404.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3404.98s)]
*  I think he got court-martialed. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3405.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3407.46s)]
*  I should look that up. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3408.34s)]
*  Wow. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3409.46s)]
*  So you went to Afghanistan after the Indian Ocean. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3410.3s)]
*  What was that like? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3412.94s)]
*  The same. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3415.02s)]
*  It was summertime. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3416.5800000000004s)]
*  So they don't really fight in the winter. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3417.7000000000003s)]
*  They do the spring offensive and they fight all summer. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3419.82s)]
*  And we just been authorized a few years prior [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3421.7000000000003s)]
*  to actually fight the Taliban [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3423.82s)]
*  because we were fighting just Al Qaeda as a tier one unit. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3425.5s)]
*  And then they authorized us to Taliban [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3427.7400000000002s)]
*  so we could fight anybody. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3429.1400000000003s)]
*  And it was just, I mean, same stuff, [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3430.86s)]
*  looking for targets that weren't as important [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3432.82s)]
*  as our government tries to make them. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3436.7400000000002s)]
*  They like words like shadow governor [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3437.94s)]
*  and here's the spider web of this leader. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3439.82s)]
*  It's like, or you mean a farmer. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3443.1800000000003s)]
*  Like where's Al Qaeda? [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3446.02s)]
*  Well, they're in Pakistan. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3447.5s)]
*  Why aren't we in Pakistan then? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3448.34s)]
*  Why weren't we in Pakistan? [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3449.86s)]
*  Well, I don't know. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3450.7000000000003s)]
*  We were running sources in and out [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3451.54s)]
*  and then the agency was right there. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3452.6200000000003s)]
*  My actual deployment right before the Bin Laden raid, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3454.1400000000003s)]
*  I was running several outstations working with the agency [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3456.1400000000003s)]
*  and the Bin Laden team was there and I didn't know them. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3460.1400000000003s)]
*  I used to give the agency shit. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3463.82s)]
*  I was like the biggest problem with the CIA [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3466.06s)]
*  is they make too many cool movies about the CIA. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3467.7400000000002s)]
*  They're not that cool. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3469.7000000000003s)]
*  But the Bin Laden team was there and they were that cool. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3471.3s)]
*  And I just didn't know it. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3473.46s)]
*  And then I met them later. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3474.3s)]
*  Were they really? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3475.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3476.38s)]
*  They lived up to the hype. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3477.2200000000003s)]
*  When I met them at first, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3478.04s)]
*  when the commanding officer SEAL Team Six came in [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3478.98s)]
*  with a team of women and said, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3481.34s)]
*  the reason you guys are here, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3483.34s)]
*  this is as close as we've ever been to Osama Bin Laden. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3484.2200000000003s)]
*  And they explained to us how they found them. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3486.02s)]
*  I was like, okay, this is their tier one unit. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3487.2200000000003s)]
*  This is a good team. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3489.38s)]
*  But the whole time they were there [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3491.06s)]
*  because we got back from Afghanistan in February or March. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3492.94s)]
*  Well, my second to last deployment [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3497.5s)]
*  was like my 12th deployment, I think. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3498.62s)]
*  And then we went to Miami for diving. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3499.98s)]
*  We were still thinking Somali pirates and the mothership. [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3505.38s)]
*  Like we're gonna make up tactics [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3507.62s)]
*  how to dive in currents in the middle of the ocean [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3509.94s)]
*  so we can hit an anchored ship. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3512.1s)]
*  And plus we're in South Beach. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3514.26s)]
*  Like we just finished war and we'll train all day [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3515.7000000000003s)]
*  and then we'll go out and have fun on the patio [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3517.5s)]
*  with happy hour with our friends. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3519.46s)]
*  And then we got recalled to Virginia, just the senior guys. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3521.02s)]
*  And when we first got there, they said, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3524.86s)]
*  this is real, this is not a drill. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3528.9s)]
*  We found a thing and this thing is in a house [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3531.54s)]
*  and it's in a bowl in these mountains and in this country. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3534.3s)]
*  And you're gonna go get it and you're gonna show it to us. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3538.06s)]
*  And we're like, cool, what's the thing? [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3541.46s)]
*  Can't tell you, okay. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3542.54s)]
*  Which country is this? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3543.94s)]
*  Can't tell you. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3544.78s)]
*  How are we getting there? [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3545.62s)]
*  Can't tell you. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3546.46s)]
*  How much air support we got? [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3547.3s)]
*  None, okay. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3548.12s)]
*  That's the answer. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3549.14s)]
*  And then we assumed it was Libya. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3550.82s)]
*  Gaddafi, the Arab Spring, whatever that was, was happening. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3552.6600000000003s)]
*  So this is April, 2011. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3555.38s)]
*  We assumed, okay, we're gonna fly off some Ospreys [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3556.9s)]
*  off a flat top. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3560.38s)]
*  And they don't wanna tell us [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3561.2200000000003s)]
*  because Ospreys have a shady track record [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3562.0600000000004s)]
*  they've crashed before. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3563.78s)]
*  Yeah, I've noticed. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3564.6200000000003s)]
*  So we're gonna go there, get them and bring it back. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3565.46s)]
*  That's gotta be it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3566.9s)]
*  So we were actually training for that. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3567.7400000000002s)]
*  And oh, they said also you're not taking any Air Force guys. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3570.42s)]
*  So if you used to carry a radio, you're the radio guy. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3573.34s)]
*  If you used to be a corpsman, you're the medic [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3575.2200000000003s)]
*  because we're not bringing PJs or CCT. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3577.98s)]
*  And so we're adjusting our gear for about a week. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3580.2599999999998s)]
*  And even other dudes from other color teams [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3583.4199999999996s)]
*  were coming up to us like, [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3585.14s)]
*  hey, this super secret mission, what is it? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3585.98s)]
*  And I'm like, I don't know. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3587.4199999999996s)]
*  And they're like, come on, you can tell me. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3588.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm like, honestly, I don't know what it is. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3590.22s)]
*  And then they, on a Friday, they briefed us again [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3592.74s)]
*  and said, all right, go home, be with your kids. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3596.18s)]
*  Come back Sunday at about 5 a.m. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3598.66s)]
*  and we're gonna leave and we're gonna drive you [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3601.02s)]
*  to a place and read you in. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3602.2999999999997s)]
*  How many men, by the way, had kids, would you say? [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3603.7s)]
*  I think all of us. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3606.74s)]
*  Wow. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3608.02s)]
*  Maybe one of the guys on the mission didn't, maybe two. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3609.02s)]
*  I could be wrong, but most guys were family men. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3611.86s)]
*  Most guys were in their early 30s, married. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3613.94s)]
*  And then they were briefing us. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3617.94s)]
*  This is actually a funny story. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3620.2599999999998s)]
*  Come in on Sunday and I remember asking, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3622.9s)]
*  who's gonna be there at the read-in? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3624.86s)]
*  They said, well, the vice president, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3626.5s)]
*  secretary of defense, secretary of the Navy. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3628.22s)]
*  It's like, Jesus. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3629.62s)]
*  But they're going down the list and they said, [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3631.34s)]
*  CTC pad will be there, blah, blah, blah. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3632.46s)]
*  And they kept going and I didn't say anything, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3633.98s)]
*  but CTC pad is a counter-terror pack Afghan. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3635.82s)]
*  If we're going to Libya, that doesn't make any sense. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3639.7400000000002s)]
*  So I went home and then we came back. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3643.1400000000003s)]
*  They split us, this is a funny story. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3644.6600000000003s)]
*  They split us up four dudes in vans [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3646.46s)]
*  and we're driving down to North Carolina. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3648.1000000000004s)]
*  My boss is next to me and my two buddies are driving [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3650.1400000000003s)]
*  and I told them exactly that, CTC pad. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3652.02s)]
*  And I said, this isn't Gaddafi. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3654.46s)]
*  They found Bin Laden. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3656.6200000000003s)]
*  And my boss looks at me and he goes, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3658.5800000000004s)]
*  that's exactly what I was thinking. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3660.42s)]
*  So we're just calmly discussing it. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3662.0600000000004s)]
*  And my buddy driving as bad as it sounds, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3663.62s)]
*  he looked me in the rear view mirror and goes, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3666.06s)]
*  man, O'Neill, if we kill Osama Bin Laden, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3667.38s)]
*  I will suck your dick. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3670.14s)]
*  Just like that. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3671.58s)]
*  Rude, but three weeks to the day, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3673.66s)]
*  we're standing over his body. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3675.38s)]
*  And I went, hey, now's a good time as any. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3676.46s)]
*  He's like, oh hell no, I'm like, you said it. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3678.8199999999997s)]
*  But then we went down to the thing and the team was there [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3681.62s)]
*  and we weren't joking anymore. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3684.8199999999997s)]
*  We're all serious. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3685.7799999999997s)]
*  And they said, yeah, this is as close [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3686.62s)]
*  as we've ever been to Osama Bin Laden. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3688.06s)]
*  And the head target or explained, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3689.2599999999998s)]
*  she must've talked to us for three hours [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3692.98s)]
*  about how she found him to the point where it's like, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3694.58s)]
*  okay, we just believe you. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3696.7400000000002s)]
*  I don't need to know anymore. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3698.62s)]
*  I don't need to know how the sausage is. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3699.98s)]
*  I trust you. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3700.86s)]
*  We're going, so let's train up on it. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3702.38s)]
*  Can we go now? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3704.06s)]
*  What was she like? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3704.9s)]
*  Just cool, as cool as you can imagine. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3705.7400000000002s)]
*  Just an awesome professional. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3707.46s)]
*  Like she's the reason that when I was saying, [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3709.58s)]
*  okay, this is the real tier one CIA, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3712.58s)]
*  she was like that bad ass. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3714.62s)]
*  The team was bad ass, but she was like in charge of it. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3716.7s)]
*  She even came with us to Jalalabad. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3718.38s)]
*  Like she stayed with us the whole time. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3720.18s)]
*  Just didn't go to ABED with her. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3722.46s)]
*  She stayed at the talk in JABED. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3723.66s)]
*  But we trained for a couple of weeks just on the exterior, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3726.18s)]
*  because I don't want you to tell me [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3732.38s)]
*  what you think is inside. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3733.46s)]
*  Like if you tell me there's definitely gonna be a right turn, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3735.3s)]
*  there's gonna be a left turn. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3737.42s)]
*  So it's like almost when we go to a target, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3738.26s)]
*  I don't want you to tell me how many men, women, [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3742.54s)]
*  and children you see. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3743.98s)]
*  Tell me how many people you see, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3744.82s)]
*  and I'll figure out who they are when I get there. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3745.78s)]
*  Just let me do that. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3747.14s)]
*  So we trained on the exterior. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3748.3s)]
*  We came up with the perfect plan. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3749.38s)]
*  We talked about contingencies. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3750.58s)]
*  The youngest guy in the room one night said, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3753.38s)]
*  well the helicopter could crash in the front yard. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3754.94s)]
*  Let's talk about that for 30 seconds, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3756.42s)]
*  and that's what happened. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3757.7799999999997s)]
*  And then we went out west to, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3759.3s)]
*  well we would stand around this table at night [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3762.02s)]
*  talking about it, and you know. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3764.82s)]
*  And this was in Jalalabad? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3767.06s)]
*  No, this is in North Carolina. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3768.22s)]
*  Someone made a two scale model of his entire place. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3770.7799999999997s)]
*  And like, seals are funny. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3772.9s)]
*  Like we have a good time. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3774.7799999999997s)]
*  And guys were joking, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3776.02s)]
*  and I'm usually the guy telling a joke or whatever, [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3777.1s)]
*  but I said to the guys like, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3778.94s)]
*  hey, you should take this a little more serious [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3779.86s)]
*  because this is a one way mission. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3782.26s)]
*  Like we're not coming home. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3783.82s)]
*  This is it for us. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3784.66s)]
*  We're gonna get shot down. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3787.18s)]
*  There's gonna be a fight. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3788.2200000000003s)]
*  If anyone's gonna blow his house up when we're in it, [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3789.38s)]
*  it's been long, we're gonna run out of fuel. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3791.46s)]
*  Like take this serious. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3792.62s)]
*  And then we went out west to Nevada, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3794.5s)]
*  and we met the helicopters, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3796.82s)]
*  and we turned a corner and we saw these things, [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3798.7000000000003s)]
*  and everyone's kind of laughing. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3800.3s)]
*  And I remember someone said to me, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3801.26s)]
*  why are you laughing now? [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3802.34s)]
*  And I go, well there's a better chance we're gonna live [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3803.18s)]
*  because I didn't know we were going to war on Transformers, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3805.46s)]
*  these helicopters that they got. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3807.5s)]
*  And we trained on them for a while. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3809.6200000000003s)]
*  And then- [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3810.46s)]
*  What were they? [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3811.3s)]
*  Stealth. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3812.1200000000003s)]
*  Helicopters that no man invented. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3813.82s)]
*  Like these things, I can't even describe them. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3815.78s)]
*  They're just- [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3818.94s)]
*  Awesome. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3820.0600000000004s)]
*  And we were training with them with- [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3821.9s)]
*  What makes them different from a conventional? [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3823.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3825.1800000000003s)]
*  It's gotta be the angles of the outside, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3826.02s)]
*  the structure and the paint. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3830.1800000000003s)]
*  Had you ever seen one? [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3831.7400000000002s)]
*  No, no one had. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3832.5800000000004s)]
*  The president didn't know about them. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3833.42s)]
*  The president didn't know about them. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3835.1000000000004s)]
*  When they were talking about what are they gonna do, [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3836.46s)]
*  are we gonna bomb the place? [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3839.46s)]
*  And the Air Force said to bomb it, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3840.82s)]
*  we gotta put 22 JDAMs on that house, 2,000 pound bombs. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3843.14s)]
*  Like you'll never know he was there. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3845.7400000000002s)]
*  And then I guess the chief of staff, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3846.78s)]
*  the Air Force said there's one more option. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3848.7400000000002s)]
*  And he told them about the helicopters [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3851.1s)]
*  and that's when we went out to train with them. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3852.3s)]
*  So the president didn't know [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3853.66s)]
*  that his own military had these. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3855.2200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3857.06s)]
*  And he was cool too. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3858.14s)]
*  There was no partisan politics on this mission. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3860.54s)]
*  This is the right thing to do. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3864.5s)]
*  When we first presented a plan, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3866.82s)]
*  two helicopters, 32 minutes, and then fly out, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3869.7400000000002s)]
*  you might run out of fuel [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3872.78s)]
*  so we're gonna run over the Hindu Kush. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3873.66s)]
*  Like we gotta get back to Afghanistan. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3875.1s)]
*  If we get compromised, [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3877.26s)]
*  it's gonna be because of the local police. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3878.78s)]
*  It's like if someone invaded near West Point, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3881.38s)]
*  it wouldn't be cadets going after them. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3883.62s)]
*  It would be the cops. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3885.26s)]
*  The sheriff, yeah. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3886.1s)]
*  And then now we're in a weird spot [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3886.94s)]
*  because I don't wanna kill cops. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3887.78s)]
*  I don't wanna kill Pakistani police. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3889.42s)]
*  They're just doing their job. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3890.52s)]
*  We're here without their invitation. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3891.38s)]
*  So what we said is we'll hard point it [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3893.62s)]
*  and then you need to send someone to Islamabad [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3896.1s)]
*  and negotiate our release or whatever [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3898.18s)]
*  because we're not gonna surrender or whatever [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3900.7799999999997s)]
*  but that was our plan. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3902.14s)]
*  And I guess Barack Obama again looked [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3902.98s)]
*  at the chief of staff of the Air Force [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3905.54s)]
*  and said, what do you need to rain hell in Pakistan? [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3906.66s)]
*  My guys are not surrendering to anybody. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3908.22s)]
*  Good for him. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3910.14s)]
*  Which is some South Chicago politics right there. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3910.98s)]
*  It was awesome. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3912.2999999999997s)]
*  So we got a guerrilla package. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3913.14s)]
*  We got more helicopters, more stuff juiced up. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3913.96s)]
*  And I don't even know what we had overhead [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3915.2999999999997s)]
*  but I mean, when we finished and they launched F-16s, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3917.9s)]
*  I know we had something up there [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3920.9s)]
*  that convinced them to turn around. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3921.9799999999996s)]
*  But these helicopters, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3924.2999999999997s)]
*  was anyone aware that these existed? [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3925.8999999999996s)]
*  No one knew about them. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3927.5s)]
*  I mean, these are helicopters. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3929.22s)]
*  So the US military can just like have, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3930.04s)]
*  I mean, it takes a lot to build a helicopter. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3931.5s)]
*  That's very weird. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3933.8199999999997s)]
*  And I can't get too much into it because- [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3934.66s)]
*  Right, to the extent you can. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3936.9399999999996s)]
*  They're like, you're not even allowed to talk [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3938.06s)]
*  about what you think you saw here. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3939.8199999999997s)]
*  Like there's some serious shit going on. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3941.9599999999996s)]
*  When you say they were out in Nevada, where in Nevada? [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3944.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, I can't say that either. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3946.54s)]
*  Yeah, but I think we know. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3947.3799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we probably know. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3948.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3949.3399999999997s)]
*  Near Vegas. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3950.18s)]
*  That's where we stayed. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3952.3799999999997s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3954.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, it gave me faith in what we can do if we need to. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3955.8199999999997s)]
*  I just find it very, not to, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3961.8599999999997s)]
*  I never thought I'd be focused on the helicopter. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3963.1s)]
*  Like who cares? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3965.06s)]
*  But that's the weirdest thing I've heard in a long time. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3965.8999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3968.8599999999997s)]
*  And then you got to figure the pilots had never heard of them. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3969.7s)]
*  And so they got to practice for what, five days [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3971.3799999999997s)]
*  and then they're flying us into Pakistan. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3973.4599999999996s)]
*  Those are the heroes, the pilots were amazing. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3975.74s)]
*  How do you get a machine like that [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3977.06s)]
*  from Vegas to Jalalabad? [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3979.1s)]
*  I think they probably put it in C-17, flew them over. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3982.22s)]
*  And then when they put them together, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3985.22s)]
*  they're in the middle of an airfield [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3986.62s)]
*  with their cover during the daytime. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3988.3399999999997s)]
*  And then there's bright lights shining out. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3990.42s)]
*  So no one can see them. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3991.7599999999998s)]
*  They would put these things in the hangar. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3993.24s)]
*  So like Chinese satellites couldn't see them. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3994.48s)]
*  They're pretty serious. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3996.94s)]
*  What's it like to ride on one? [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=3999.06s)]
*  It was comfortable. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4000.8199999999997s)]
*  It was quiet and it was just cool. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4001.98s)]
*  There was more room in that. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4005.2999999999997s)]
*  They look kind of like a 60s. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4007.2599999999998s)]
*  There's no engine, right? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4009.78s)]
*  It's just all anti-gravity. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4010.62s)]
*  Yeah, they're flying by magnets. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4012.46s)]
*  But no, they were cool. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4014.5s)]
*  And it was comforting because, I mean, [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4015.5s)]
*  once you take off and cross the border, [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4018.38s)]
*  they tell you that you're in Pakistan. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4021.5s)]
*  It's like, okay, now we're going to find out if this works. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4022.66s)]
*  And then again, the mindset comes in like, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4026.06s)]
*  worrying about a missile is not going to stop it. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4029.14s)]
*  So I'm not going to worry about it. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4031.86s)]
*  It's like, you're worried about anything in life [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4034.06s)]
*  that your worry doesn't affect. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4035.38s)]
*  Why are you wasting your energy? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4036.54s)]
*  So what I do, I learned as a sniper was count. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4038.02s)]
*  So I would count from zero to a thousand, thousand to zero. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4041.06s)]
*  And I would just get that in my head. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4043.42s)]
*  Changing the cadence up, just counting, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4045.14s)]
*  looking at the watch, we had 90 minutes to get in there. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4047.18s)]
*  Cairo, Cairo the dog was sitting next to me, the Malinois. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4049.62s)]
*  No ordinary dog is a book written about him. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4053.26s)]
*  His handler, Chesney was right here. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4055.82s)]
*  Good dog. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4057.62s)]
*  He's the best dog. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4058.54s)]
*  He was the best dog I've ever worked with. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4059.38s)]
*  Cairo was the best. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4061.1s)]
*  What made him great? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4061.94s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4062.78s)]
*  He was just a, he was smart. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4063.62s)]
*  He was just a good boy. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4065.34s)]
*  He'd been shot before in the chest, in a gunfight. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4067.1400000000003s)]
*  Wait. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4071.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4071.94s)]
*  And when a dog gets shot, he's just dead. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4072.78s)]
*  And it was a really weird gunfight a couple of years before [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4075.94s)]
*  we were doing vehicle interdictions. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4079.34s)]
*  Taliban and Al-Qaeda were figuring [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4081.98s)]
*  that we were coming after them at night. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4083.1400000000003s)]
*  So they would start driving their motorcycles [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4084.3s)]
*  right around dusk to cross the border of Pakistan. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4085.82s)]
*  And then we just started hunting them on their motorcycles. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4087.6200000000003s)]
*  And if you've never hunted men out of a helicopter [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4090.6200000000003s)]
*  on motorcycles, you have not lived. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4093.1800000000003s)]
*  You take pig hunting. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4094.6600000000003s)]
*  That's nothing. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4096.9s)]
*  Hunting guys on motorcycles. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4097.74s)]
*  So we got in a fight one night where we found a low ground. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4098.58s)]
*  We ended up in the low ground. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4100.62s)]
*  We had to split it up and I had to flank some guys up here. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4101.9800000000005s)]
*  And these guys went down there and there was, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4104.26s)]
*  we could hear my guys in a fight and they said, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4105.9400000000005s)]
*  hey, we got a friendly wounded in action. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4108.18s)]
*  And I asked who is it? [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4110.58s)]
*  I wanted a call sign. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4112.26s)]
*  Cause you know, if you tell a call sign, [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4113.1s)]
*  you don't know who it is, but I know exactly who it is. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4114.66s)]
*  And they said Cairo. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4116.78s)]
*  And I'm like, fuck, he's dead. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4117.82s)]
*  I just, he got shot in the chest and the arm. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4119.9s)]
*  But the guy with him, who was actually the point man [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4121.86s)]
*  in the Bin Laden raid got to him and like shaved him [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4125.26s)]
*  and put a chest seal on him. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4128.14s)]
*  The pilots came in under fire and pulled him out. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4129.66s)]
*  And then the surgeons were waiting for him [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4131.820000000001s)]
*  and they saved him. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4133.820000000001s)]
*  So Cairo lived and he actually, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4135.1s)]
*  he actually- [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4137.22s)]
*  The pilots landed under fire to save the dog? [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4138.06s)]
*  Yep. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4140.02s)]
*  Cause that does make you love America. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4140.860000000001s)]
*  Cause he's one of the guys. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4142.58s)]
*  We're his pack. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4143.900000000001s)]
*  Other countries don't do stuff like that. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4145.3s)]
*  So he went on trips with us again and he actually, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4146.860000000001s)]
*  he actually got PTSD cause we'd be on targets [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4148.58s)]
*  and we tell him to go in a room and he kind of, you sure? [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4151.780000000001s)]
*  And I'm like, yes, that's your job, get in there. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4154.14s)]
*  But then he went on the Bin Laden raid and he was- [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4156.42s)]
*  So why, why do you, pardon my ignorance, [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4158.22s)]
*  why do you bring a dog on a raid? [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4159.9400000000005s)]
*  He can smell them. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4161.26s)]
*  He can find them. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4162.1s)]
*  People hiding. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4163.5s)]
*  I've had them open secret doors for me. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4164.34s)]
*  Like get on their hind legs and push something [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4166.22s)]
*  and it opens in a castle. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4167.54s)]
*  Just weird Afghanistan stories. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4169.06s)]
*  They'll chase people down. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4170.9400000000005s)]
*  They'll corner them. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4172.22s)]
*  Just like finding a grouse. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4175.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4177.1s)]
*  And they're, well, even a Cairo, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4178.18s)]
*  I read stories that he had some $20,000 titanium teeth, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4180.42s)]
*  which is bullshit. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4183.58s)]
*  He had one tooth because of a gum disease. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4184.54s)]
*  He was there for his nose and his job was- [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4186.3s)]
*  He had one tooth. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4188.66s)]
*  He had one tooth. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4189.5s)]
*  He was just a good boy. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4190.34s)]
*  But on the, yeah, and he was with us always. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4191.94s)]
*  He was one of the dogs that could, [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4194.54s)]
*  when we were overseas, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4197.0599999999995s)]
*  we would have like the stadium seating with leather couches [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4198.0599999999995s)]
*  to watch when we're not working, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4200.42s)]
*  watch TV and everyone can sit there. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4201.66s)]
*  And once you take their vest off, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4202.98s)]
*  they're just part of the pack now. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4204.94s)]
*  So you can pet them, you can play with them. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4206.62s)]
*  And they want their ball more than a treat. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4207.98s)]
*  But then they'll do stuff like if they're up [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4210.38s)]
*  on the same level as you and put upon you, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4211.86s)]
*  you gotta push them off [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4213.9s)]
*  because they're trying to get up there. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4215.219999999999s)]
*  Because like his handler is his dad and you're an uncle. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4216.54s)]
*  And if they start doing that paw shit, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4219.74s)]
*  they're trying to get up the chain of command. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4220.9s)]
*  So you- [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4222.38s)]
*  They certainly are. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4223.219999999999s)]
*  They're trying to dominate you. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4224.0599999999995s)]
*  But then you gotta be careful [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4224.9s)]
*  because he doesn't have a muzzle on. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4225.74s)]
*  If you piss him off, maybe he'll bite. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4227.259999999999s)]
*  But Cairo never would. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4229.139999999999s)]
*  None of the dogs ever bit. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4230.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, one dog probably did, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4231.139999999999s)]
*  but he was just a good boy. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4232.0599999999995s)]
*  He never would do that. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4233.62s)]
*  He wouldn't even try to challenge for hierarchy. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4234.46s)]
*  He was just awesome. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4237.219999999999s)]
*  Just a great dog. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4238.0599999999995s)]
*  That book's amazing. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4239.099999999999s)]
*  An ordinary dog is amazing. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4239.94s)]
*  And they can find people anywhere. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4241.46s)]
*  Anywhere. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4243.1s)]
*  Yeah, you're not hiding from him. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4243.94s)]
*  And you're not gonna outrun him. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4245.34s)]
*  If you score it. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4246.94s)]
*  Because it's better to send a dog to get him [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4248.38s)]
*  than to just shoot a guy. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4250.38s)]
*  He'll bite him and then we'll arrest him. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4251.82s)]
*  Because you don't know, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4253.62s)]
*  he might be running because he's afraid. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4254.46s)]
*  I'm not under bin Laden. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4256.02s)]
*  And this is not a culture in Afghanistan or Pakistan [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4256.86s)]
*  where people keep dogs at home, right? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4259.78s)]
*  No, they hate dogs. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4261.34s)]
*  But they have dogs. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4262.42s)]
*  They have them. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4263.26s)]
*  Like one of the hardest things to get used to [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4264.08s)]
*  is the 30 dogs that are barking as you roll up on a house. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4266.14s)]
*  They're just out there barking all the time. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4268.62s)]
*  But they're not pets. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4270.58s)]
*  No. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4271.5s)]
*  But our dog, that's cool to watch our dogs with those dogs [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4272.54s)]
*  because they don't give a shit. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4275.7s)]
*  Like I'm so much better than you. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4276.82s)]
*  I didn't even pay attention to the other dogs. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4279.58s)]
*  Really? [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4281.66s)]
*  Like I'm the one wearing a vest. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4282.5s)]
*  I'm carrying extra magazines. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4284.14s)]
*  You're nothing. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4285.3s)]
*  They carry extra magazines? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4286.74s)]
*  They carry mags and they wear a flag [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4287.78s)]
*  and he had his red man patch. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4289.0599999999995s)]
*  And so I was sitting next to Cairo. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4292.0199999999995s)]
*  He was asleep on the, [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4293.26s)]
*  and it was a funny conversation just to what, [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4294.34s)]
*  cause not conversation. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4296.74s)]
*  I was looking around the Hilo, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4297.98s)]
*  flying into bin Laden's house [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4299.22s)]
*  just to see how my guys were handling. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4300.18s)]
*  We could get shot down. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4302.38s)]
*  How are you guys dealing with this? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4304.26s)]
*  And one of my friends was asleep. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4305.26s)]
*  He put his headphones on, he was asleep. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4306.780000000001s)]
*  And I kid you not that what I said to myself was, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4308.34s)]
*  you're asleep literally on the ride [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4311.26s)]
*  to Osama bin Laden's house. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4313.860000000001s)]
*  Like you have ice in your veins [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4315.38s)]
*  and I actually see why women find you attractive. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4316.42s)]
*  That's bad ass. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4318.58s)]
*  That is bad ass. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4319.740000000001s)]
*  And then we banked to the south, 10 minutes out. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4320.58s)]
*  And it sounds Hollywood, but I was counting still. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4324.9400000000005s)]
*  And I don't know how I remembered the quote, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4327.14s)]
*  but I said, 556, 557, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4328.38s)]
*  freedom itself was attacked this morning [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4330.900000000001s)]
*  by a faceless coward and freedom will be defended. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4332.26s)]
*  And it kind of sunk in 10 minutes from bin Laden's house. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4335.02s)]
*  Like, holy shit, this is the mission. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4336.9800000000005s)]
*  This is the team and we're going to kill them. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4338.900000000001s)]
*  Holy shit. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4340.26s)]
*  And then like the air crew guy who never gets credit, [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4341.54s)]
*  he reached over and opened the door two minutes out. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4344.54s)]
*  Like the crew chief's job was to keep the helicopter flying [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4347.5s)]
*  and open the door. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4350.34s)]
*  That's it. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4351.34s)]
*  But how important is that? [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4352.18s)]
*  What if we couldn't have figured out the door? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4353.14s)]
*  Like just sitting in a helicopter, can't get out. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4355.06s)]
*  And if we got hit with a missile, [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4357.0199999999995s)]
*  he's got a family too and they'll miss him, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4358.419999999999s)]
*  but no one ever mentions him. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4359.82s)]
*  He's a hero. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4361.339999999999s)]
*  He opened the door. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4362.179999999999s)]
*  He was the first step of us getting into bin Laden's house. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4363.0199999999995s)]
*  Who are the pilots? [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4365.219999999999s)]
*  Not by name, but who do you get to fly a machine like that? [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4366.299999999999s)]
*  They're Task Force 160 at the Night Stalkers. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4369.82s)]
*  Talented? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4372.299999999999s)]
*  They're the best in the world. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4373.139999999999s)]
*  The army helicopter pilots [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4374.66s)]
*  are the best helicopter pilots in the world. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4375.7s)]
*  And we got the best four. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4377.94s)]
*  And we're lucky we did because the flight lead [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4379.5s)]
*  saved everyone's life on the first helicopter [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4382.219999999999s)]
*  by crash landing it in the front yard. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4383.78s)]
*  How did you crash land a helicopter like that? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4387.58s)]
*  He told me, I'm not a pilot, [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4389.54s)]
*  but he told me when they were coming into fast rope, [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4390.7s)]
*  which is when you hover 30 feet, 20 feet, whatever, [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4392.98s)]
*  ropes come out, snipers are watching, guys just slide down. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4395.58s)]
*  They're gonna separate to where they're going. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4397.7s)]
*  And we're gonna drop some guys off and Cairo outside. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4400.219999999999s)]
*  And then my team's going to the rooftop. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4403.219999999999s)]
*  We're gonna hit them that way. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4404.38s)]
*  But as soon as he started to hover, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4405.5s)]
*  he realized he couldn't hover. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4406.86s)]
*  Like there was an updraft. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4407.94s)]
*  Some with the fences were different [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4409.219999999999s)]
*  than the ones we were training on. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4410.58s)]
*  And it was a little bit warmer than we were used to. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4412.58s)]
*  So they're not gonna get that much lift. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4415.66s)]
*  And he said an inexperienced pilot would have powered it up [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4418.18s)]
*  and rolled it and everyone would have died. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4420.139999999999s)]
*  But he realized in the blink of an eye, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4422.12s)]
*  if he can turn it and put the tail on the 15 foot fence [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4423.42s)]
*  and pin the nose, everyone might live. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4426.26s)]
*  And he made that decision quicker than I just explained it. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4429.22s)]
*  And he just smacked it into the ground. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4431.26s)]
*  And then our pilots was bringing us to the rooftop. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4434.0199999999995s)]
*  Was anyone injured in that? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4436.66s)]
*  Yeah, but not like at the time, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4437.9s)]
*  they have bad backs now, like they're spying stuff, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4441.139999999999s)]
*  but nobody got hurt right then. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4444.1s)]
*  And plus the adrenaline was pumping. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4446.1s)]
*  I'd imagine just getting dropped off in a crashed helicopter [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4447.38s)]
*  in the front yard of the number one terrorist in the world. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4451.700000000001s)]
*  And you don't know what the resistance is gonna be. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4454.660000000001s)]
*  And so our guy lifted up, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4456.660000000001s)]
*  but he saw them and then put us down. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4457.9800000000005s)]
*  And he knew they couldn't hover. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4459.54s)]
*  He probably couldn't hover, [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4460.860000000001s)]
*  but we didn't know they crashed. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4461.700000000001s)]
*  So he kicked us out. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4463.02s)]
*  So now we're outside of Bin Laden's house, [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4464.620000000001s)]
*  looking at a 20 foot wall on this end, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4466.06s)]
*  I can see his house. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4467.42s)]
*  And I remember just thinking, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4468.660000000001s)]
*  I guess we start the war from here. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4469.5s)]
*  We know what we're doing. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4470.860000000001s)]
*  There's a door right over there. [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4471.700000000001s)]
*  Let's go blow that one up. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4472.98s)]
*  So we went to the Northeast corner where there's a double [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4474.82s)]
*  door and I called a breacher up, [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4476.86s)]
*  who's a breacher is the methods of entry guy. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4481.299999999999s)]
*  He's gonna get you in. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4483.0599999999995s)]
*  He'll pick that lock. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4484.139999999999s)]
*  He'll break that glass. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4485.179999999999s)]
*  He'll blow that door. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4486.0199999999995s)]
*  So he decided to put a seven foot charge of C6 [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4487.099999999999s)]
*  on the double door, which will open anything. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4489.58s)]
*  And he blasted it and we tried to go in [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4491.139999999999s)]
*  and there was an open like a tin can, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4493.259999999999s)]
*  but there was a brick wall behind it. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4494.94s)]
*  And- [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4497.0199999999995s)]
*  Why was there a brick wall behind? [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4497.86s)]
*  Fake door. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4498.7s)]
*  He just made a fake door. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4499.54s)]
*  And the breacher turned around and he goes, fake door. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4500.86s)]
*  This is failed breach. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4502.42s)]
*  This is bad. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4503.46s)]
*  And I said, no, this is good. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4504.3s)]
*  That's a fake door. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4505.78s)]
*  Nobody does that. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4506.7s)]
*  He's in there. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4507.54s)]
*  So now we know this door opens over here. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4508.7s)]
*  It's a carport. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4510.5s)]
*  So we had to go past his house to this double door [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4511.34s)]
*  that we knew open cause we'd seen it open. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4514.02s)]
*  And the other, we heard them saying dash one going around, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4515.66s)]
*  dash one going around cause we assumed they took fire [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4522.9800000000005s)]
*  and they're doing a racetrack and they're gonna reengage, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4525.38s)]
*  but they were saying dash one going down. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4527.62s)]
*  So we didn't know they crashed and we said, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4530.06s)]
*  hey, this is so and so we're gonna blast the carport. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4531.34s)]
*  And they said, no, no, no, don't blast it. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4533.58s)]
*  We'll open it. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4534.78s)]
*  And before that could even register, [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4535.78s)]
*  the double doors open and a thumb came out [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4537.1s)]
*  with a glove that we recognize. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4539.14s)]
*  And it's like, okay, it doesn't matter. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4540.54s)]
*  I don't know why they're in there, but it doesn't matter. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4542.46s)]
*  They just are. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4544.14s)]
*  They're in there. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4545.3s)]
*  And that's a point in life. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4546.42s)]
*  Like sometimes it doesn't matter why. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4547.820000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4549.5s)]
*  It just is and the clock's ticking. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4550.34s)]
*  I told you yesterday about the football team. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4551.78s)]
*  When I talked to the offense, [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4553.1s)]
*  like it doesn't matter why it's second at 15, it just is. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4554.860000000001s)]
*  And you can complain about it, but the clock's ticking. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4557.42s)]
*  We gotta make a move. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4560.1s)]
*  So then there was already, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4561.700000000001s)]
*  and this is a weird thing about rules of engagement too. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4563.26s)]
*  One of my guys was outside of the house [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4565.34s)]
*  and he'd shot through the window at, I think a bra, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4567.740000000001s)]
*  one of the couriers and his wife jumped in front of him. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4570.58s)]
*  So he shot her too. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4572.54s)]
*  And he looked at me, [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4574.18s)]
*  this is how fucked up the rules of engagement are. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4575.14s)]
*  He goes, and this is a SEAL Team Six guy. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4577.14s)]
*  He goes, she just jumped in front of him. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4578.46s)]
*  I just shot her. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4580.22s)]
*  Am I gonna be in trouble? [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4581.06s)]
*  And I go, dude, who cares? [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4582.26s)]
*  Let's go find Ben Laden [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4584.660000000001s)]
*  and then we'll worry about rules of engagement. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4585.5s)]
*  But why is that in your mind right now? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4587.1s)]
*  Because your leadership is so poor [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4588.46s)]
*  that you're thinking about going to jail right now? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4590.42s)]
*  So then we got inside the house. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4592.82s)]
*  These are all guys from the other helicopter. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4594.34s)]
*  They're going down a long hallway. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4597.5s)]
*  And I hopped into a room, [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4598.9s)]
*  because I hope you're never in this position, [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4600.02s)]
*  but if you're in a gunfight in a house, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4602.38s)]
*  get out of the hallway. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4603.46s)]
*  That's just good business. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4604.7s)]
*  So I'm in this thing and I'm looking for bombs [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4605.94s)]
*  because he's gonna blow this house up. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4608.46s)]
*  He's gotta be a martyr. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4610.02s)]
*  And one of the guys behind me just said, [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4611.42s)]
*  helicopter crashed. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4613.78s)]
*  And I said, because we had extra helicopters. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4615.86s)]
*  So I thought, they were 45 minutes behind us. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4617.58s)]
*  They weren't stealth. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4620.0199999999995s)]
*  So I thought we just lost two helicopters [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4620.94s)]
*  full of my friends. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4622.86s)]
*  And I'm like, my God, what helicopter crashed? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4623.7s)]
*  He goes, bro, our helicopter crashed in the front yard. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4625.46s)]
*  I think he walked right past it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4627.54s)]
*  You didn't even notice that? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4629.58s)]
*  No, I didn't even notice it. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4630.42s)]
*  But now it makes sense. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4631.58s)]
*  Okay, now that's why they're in here. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4632.42s)]
*  And then even the sniper who was with Cairo running around, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4633.78s)]
*  he saw the tail on the fence. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4637.14s)]
*  So he's running around and the tail was right there. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4639.1s)]
*  And his response, he came over to the radio and said, [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4640.94s)]
*  all right, guys, be on alert. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4643.54s)]
*  They're ready for us. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4645.14s)]
*  We're gonna have a training mockup [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4646.0199999999995s)]
*  of our super secret helicopter in the front yard. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4646.86s)]
*  And then there was silence. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4650.339999999999s)]
*  He thought it was Bin Laden's. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4652.179999999999s)]
*  They're training on it, yeah. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4653.0199999999995s)]
*  And the boss came over and he goes, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4654.0199999999995s)]
*  no, jackass, that's ours because we crashed. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4655.179999999999s)]
*  And he goes, that makes a lot more sense than the shit [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4657.94s)]
*  I was just saying. [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4659.299999999999s)]
*  So these are the conversations. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4660.299999999999s)]
*  And it's crazy to think that guys [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4661.459999999999s)]
*  still have their sense of humor. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4663.219999999999s)]
*  But then I'm behind my guys and I'm watching them. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4664.9s)]
*  And it was just so cool. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4667.82s)]
*  I'm just so proud of them. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4668.78s)]
*  Like we could die at any second. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4670.099999999999s)]
*  And it's not even phasing you guys. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4671.62s)]
*  You're just doing your job. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4673.0199999999995s)]
*  Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4673.94s)]
*  No one's freaking out. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4675.5s)]
*  Just you're escalating as necessary. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4676.58s)]
*  You know, you're kick the door, try the door, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4679.22s)]
*  kick the door, go mechanical, go explosive, boom. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4681.66s)]
*  And then the woman told us you're gonna run into a stairwell [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4684.34s)]
*  and you're gonna run into Khalid Bin Laden. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4688.38s)]
*  So the head. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4690.34s)]
*  Who's Khalid Bin Laden? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4691.18s)]
*  His son, his 20 year old son. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4692.14s)]
*  And she said, and she ended up being 100% right [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4694.06s)]
*  on everybody in the house. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4696.42s)]
*  This was the CIA target. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4697.58s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4699.06s)]
*  Woman, sorry, not check. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4699.9s)]
*  I doubt she'd care. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4702.26s)]
*  Don't think she gives a shit. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4703.1s)]
*  But yeah, he was right there and he hopped behind a banister [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4704.82s)]
*  and we got eight dudes going up the stairs. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4706.94s)]
*  It kind of turned, they go up and turn back [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4708.86s)]
*  and they're separated by just a banister [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4710.62s)]
*  and they're both armed. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4714.179999999999s)]
*  They're both grown men and they want to kill each other. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4715.0599999999995s)]
*  And so in set night, normally I'd pick some guys back [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4716.74s)]
*  and move them out of the way. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4719.38s)]
*  Cause in an urban environment, [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4720.38s)]
*  if they start throwing grenades, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4721.46s)]
*  but we're gonna die. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4722.78s)]
*  So I want to see how this goes down. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4723.82s)]
*  I got to see this. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4725.0199999999995s)]
*  And he just whispered to him. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4726.219999999999s)]
*  Cause we're quiet. [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4727.62s)]
*  We're not saying anything to each other. [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4728.46s)]
*  So we confuse the shit out of them. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4729.5s)]
*  And he whispered something along the lines of come here, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4731.139999999999s)]
*  in Urdu and Arabic. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4733.78s)]
*  And he said his name twice, Khalid. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4735.62s)]
*  And Khalid leaned over, he's got a gun. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4737.46s)]
*  He leaned over and he goes, what? [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4739.54s)]
*  Blasted him right there. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4741.7s)]
*  How did he know how to say come here Khalid in Urdu [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4742.54s)]
*  and Arabic? [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4745.900000000001s)]
*  That's how smart he was. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4746.74s)]
*  He just knew he would need to know how to say that. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4747.58s)]
*  Just certain things like, I was kind of arrogant. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4749.62s)]
*  Then when someone tried to teach me how to say, [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4752.3s)]
*  drop your gun. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4753.7s)]
*  It's like, I don't need to know how to say that. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4754.82s)]
*  I can say it like that. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4755.900000000001s)]
*  I'll just shoot him. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4757.02s)]
*  He'll drop his gun. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4757.86s)]
*  But this guy learned it. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4758.74s)]
*  And like, he just was smart. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4759.62s)]
*  And that saved, I don't know how many lives. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4761.22s)]
*  Because if we turn that corner with an AK, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4762.82s)]
*  I don't care how much body armor you have on at that range [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4764.7s)]
*  with a 7.62. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4767.9s)]
*  He killed him and I remember walking over his body [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4769.34s)]
*  thinking, okay, that's the coolest thing I've ever seen. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4771.54s)]
*  And I was right for about seven seconds [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4773.54s)]
*  and then I saw him in law and that was cooler. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4775.299999999999s)]
*  But we went to the second floor. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4777.259999999999s)]
*  I'm about seven or eight, I forget the number back [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4779.54s)]
*  and guys start to split off because you got unknowns. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4781.5s)]
*  There are people in here, rooms over there and there. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4783.259999999999s)]
*  So they're clearing that and we're down to two guys now. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4786.0599999999995s)]
*  So the point man that killed Khalid and then me. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4788.299999999999s)]
*  And the way that works is he's looking up [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4791.14s)]
*  and I'm looking back and I have, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4793.18s)]
*  you wanna have not control, [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4795.04s)]
*  but you wanna let the point man know you're there. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4796.18s)]
*  So either hold his leg or hold his shoulder. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4798.18s)]
*  And he's feeling that and he's always looking forward [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4800.06s)]
*  and wherever his eye goes, his gun goes. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4803.14s)]
*  So he's looking at the top of this curtain [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4805.9400000000005s)]
*  and he can see people moving behind it. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4807.740000000001s)]
*  And so he starts to pimp me. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4809.9400000000005s)]
*  Doesn't know it's me, but he knows it's one of his shooters. [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4812.06s)]
*  And he just starts saying, we gotta go now. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4814.42s)]
*  Come on, we gotta go, we gotta go. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4815.62s)]
*  Because he's saying those are the suicide bombers, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4818.5s)]
*  but we can beat him, but we have to go right now. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4820.38s)]
*  And for me, it was just, it wasn't bravery. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4822.62s)]
*  It was like, he's right. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4824.66s)]
*  I want four, I'll take two, but it's gonna be just us. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4825.78s)]
*  And we're gonna blow up now, I'm tired of thinking about it. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4829.5s)]
*  And I just squeezed him, he went up. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4833.06s)]
*  And there's a curtain at the top of the stairs, not a door. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4835.16s)]
*  And he moved the curtain [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4837.96s)]
*  and there was these two women there. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4839.1s)]
*  And he assumed those were suicide bombers. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4840.54s)]
*  So he just jumped on them, which is most courageous thing. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4842.7s)]
*  He jumped on them. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4846.3s)]
*  He tackled them to absorb the blast [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4847.14s)]
*  so the guy behind him could get a shot. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4849.22s)]
*  Like it's crazy. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4850.54s)]
*  And you can't say that man's name. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4851.38s)]
*  No, but he should have a Medal of Honor. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4852.42s)]
*  Someone knows who he is. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4855.84s)]
*  And it's not hard to figure it out. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4856.9800000000005s)]
*  And simply because he went this way, I turned left [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4858.820000000001s)]
*  and there's Bin Laden standing there. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4861.38s)]
*  What was Bin Laden doing? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4862.34s)]
*  He had his both hands on Amal, his wife, [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4863.38s)]
*  and she was shorter and he was tall. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4866.42s)]
*  And he was maneuvering. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4868.780000000001s)]
*  He was skinnier than I thought. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4871.740000000001s)]
*  His beard was kind of gray, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4872.900000000001s)]
*  taller than I thought he'd be skinnier. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4875.38s)]
*  I remember skinny, but I was looking right at him [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4876.64s)]
*  and that's his nose. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4878.7s)]
*  I've seen that nose a thousand times. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4879.54s)]
*  He said, did he look at you? [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4880.5s)]
*  I think so, but it was dark and he's a threat. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4881.62s)]
*  I got to kill him. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4884.22s)]
*  And the way you kill a suicide bomber [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4885.0599999999995s)]
*  is shoot him in the mouth or in the head. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4885.88s)]
*  So I shot him twice in the head [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4888.24s)]
*  and then once more on the floor. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4889.62s)]
*  Because all they need to do a suicide bomber, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4890.76s)]
*  I've dealt with suicide bombers and it is terrifying [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4892.3s)]
*  and it's permanent and it's loud, it's scary. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4894.98s)]
*  And all they need to do is have like a negative [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4897.34s)]
*  and a positive, they just got to touch the leads. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4898.94s)]
*  So they can do that like this and then just go boop. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4900.74s)]
*  And then everyone blows up. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4903.4s)]
*  So I was even giving some shit about that. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4905.139999999999s)]
*  Why'd you shoot him in the face? [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4907.34s)]
*  Positive identifications like, well, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4908.62s)]
*  shoot him in the chest. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4910.42s)]
*  People live for a couple seconds [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4911.24s)]
*  after you shoot him in the chest. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4912.42s)]
*  You want to kill him. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4913.26s)]
*  He needs to go down. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4914.1s)]
*  What'd you shoot him with? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4915.54s)]
*  Five, five, six. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4916.9400000000005s)]
*  Hollow points, 77 green, H&K 416. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4918.42s)]
*  How long between when you identified him and shot him? [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4923.02s)]
*  Probably maybe a second. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4926.820000000001s)]
*  Like the saying we had is, [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4929.820000000001s)]
*  you have a second to convince me not to kill you. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4932.46s)]
*  And he didn't do it. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4935.1s)]
*  And that was his bedroom? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4936.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4937.38s)]
*  What was his bedroom like? [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4938.22s)]
*  Big bed, King bed. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4940.1s)]
*  I think he and I think they were him, his daughters [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4940.9400000000005s)]
*  and his wife and young son were all in there. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4944.26s)]
*  I think it was two daughters, I think. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4947.58s)]
*  At the time when you shot them, they were all there? [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4950.38s)]
*  Yeah, they were all there. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4951.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, it was the daughter that actually said, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4952.820000000001s)]
*  finally it was that's Shaco Sama. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4954.5s)]
*  You got him. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4955.9400000000005s)]
*  That's before we did the Geronimo call. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4956.78s)]
*  Cause we, this is cool. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4958.46s)]
*  We had a dude from another squadron [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4959.820000000001s)]
*  who had been teaching himself Arabic. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4961.18s)]
*  So he was already deployed with blue squadron. [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4963.4800000000005s)]
*  And we floored it all about he was there. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4967.14s)]
*  And because he taught himself Arabic, we're bringing you. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4968.46s)]
*  Cause you're a shooter, seal team six, you're coming. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4970.900000000001s)]
*  So congratulations. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4973.16s)]
*  So he was the one that was speaking Arabic. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4974.66s)]
*  And even his buddies were giving him shit [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4976.18s)]
*  because we had stopped going to Iraq [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4977.66s)]
*  and we're just in Afghanistan. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4979.780000000001s)]
*  It's like, why are you still studying Arabic? [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4980.740000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4982.06s)]
*  You don't need it. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4982.900000000001s)]
*  Well, it's like the skydive. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4983.72s)]
*  I might need it once. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4984.62s)]
*  And the daughter was trying to say it wasn't him. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4986.22s)]
*  She finally said, yeah, that's him. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4988.62s)]
*  That's Shaco Sama. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4989.5s)]
*  You got him. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4990.34s)]
*  His daughter said that. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4991.54s)]
*  Yes, the daughter said that. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4992.38s)]
*  And then when we came over the radio [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4993.22s)]
*  and we were in forgotten country, Geronimo Eka. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4994.54s)]
*  And that wasn't, we didn't, we got shit for that too. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4997.0199999999995s)]
*  Because we used the word Geronimo as a pro word. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=4999.5s)]
*  We didn't name him Geronimo. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5002.9s)]
*  That would be an insult to Chief Geronimo. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5004.14s)]
*  It was a pro word in honor of Chief Geronimo. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5006.0199999999995s)]
*  Instead of saying, hey, I'm in Bin Laden's room [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5008.26s)]
*  and he's dead, you say Geronimo Eka. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5010.74s)]
*  Meaning Geronimo means I am with Bin Laden right now. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5012.9s)]
*  And you have different pro words. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5015.44s)]
*  Instead of saying, hey, I'm at the front gate, [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5016.38s)]
*  you say something else. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5017.94s)]
*  Like orange fresh. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5019.38s)]
*  How did the kids and the wife respond? [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5020.22s)]
*  They were shocked. [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5022.62s)]
*  They were surprised. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5023.46s)]
*  Then they were scared. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5024.78s)]
*  They were the same as every target. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5025.9800000000005s)]
*  They huddled in a corner and you know, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5028.14s)]
*  you try to calm them down. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5030.02s)]
*  Try to reassure them, you're not gonna get hurt now. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5032.3s)]
*  Just sit here. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5034.38s)]
*  And then when you're leaving, you say, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5035.76s)]
*  all right, stay here until the sun comes up. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5036.72s)]
*  We do have aircraft, so don't go outside [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5038.3s)]
*  until Pakistani military gets here. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5039.9800000000005s)]
*  Then you'll be fine. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5041.58s)]
*  We're taking him. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5043.14s)]
*  Is he the only person you took? [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5044.54s)]
*  We left everybody else there. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5047.5s)]
*  What else did you take? [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5048.46s)]
*  We found a bunch of intel. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5050.38s)]
*  We didn't know if he was running Al-Qaeda, but he was. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5051.78s)]
*  He had, it might've been two or three offices. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5054.82s)]
*  So we took, they had the old school towers [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5058.599999999999s)]
*  for a home computer. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5061.0599999999995s)]
*  So we crushed those, took the hard drives out. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5061.9s)]
*  We found a bunch of CDs and a bunch of papers [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5064.0s)]
*  and anything electronic or written, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5066.54s)]
*  we just threw it in a bag and brought it back. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5069.139999999999s)]
*  And then we spread it up with the intel analysts [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5070.94s)]
*  when we got back and they went through. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5073.0599999999995s)]
*  I didn't really go through anything. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5074.5s)]
*  I've heard rumors of missions and porn and all that stuff. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5075.5s)]
*  But I think the porn might've been there [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5078.5s)]
*  because they were, they embedded missions on that. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5079.94s)]
*  So if someone looked at it, they would just see porn [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5085.98s)]
*  but not the mission they're trying to send, I guess. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5087.94s)]
*  And again, that might not be what happened [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5090.62s)]
*  but that's what someone told me. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5092.78s)]
*  But I didn't go through any of the intel. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5093.86s)]
*  The inside of his house, was it like the house [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5097.259999999999s)]
*  of a rich guy? [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5099.74s)]
*  No, it was kind of standard. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5100.94s)]
*  Like I think he might've been the only one with a bed bed. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5102.74s)]
*  The rest of them had like floor mats, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5105.5s)]
*  just kind of like everywhere over there. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5107.179999999999s)]
*  And then there's animals and trash that they burn. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5108.3s)]
*  And it's not, I mean, there's a garden, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5110.900000000001s)]
*  they were growing their food and three story house [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5112.3s)]
*  but it wasn't, I mean, it looked like the outside. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5114.74s)]
*  It was a stone inside. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5117.06s)]
*  There wasn't a lot of decoration. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5118.02s)]
*  There was a couple things hanging up, [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5119.06s)]
*  Korans on shelves and shit like that. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5121.9800000000005s)]
*  How did it smell? [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5123.820000000001s)]
*  I don't really remember. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5125.06s)]
*  When I got in there, it smelled like bombs going off [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5126.5s)]
*  because my guys had breached a few times. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5128.38s)]
*  So it smelled like a training area. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5130.34s)]
*  And again, it was one of those things [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5132.54s)]
*  where you're just kind of taking a snapshot. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5133.900000000001s)]
*  I remember saying like, you remember this [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5135.14s)]
*  because this is gonna be it. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5136.98s)]
*  Like this is gonna blow up, just remember this. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5137.86s)]
*  And then, I killed Bin Laden, we got Bin Laden [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5140.0199999999995s)]
*  and I was just standing there. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5142.379999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna go take a picture. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5143.9s)]
*  And one of my guys came up to me and he goes, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5144.94s)]
*  hey, are you good? [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5146.299999999999s)]
*  And I said, what do we do now? [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5147.54s)]
*  Cause we're still alive. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5149.94s)]
*  And he's like, now we find the computers. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5151.299999999999s)]
*  Every night we do this hundreds of times, right? [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5153.0199999999995s)]
*  And I said, yeah, you're right, holy shit. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5155.139999999999s)]
*  And he said, yeah, you just killed Osama Bin Laden. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5156.379999999999s)]
*  Your life just changed, now get to work. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5158.0599999999995s)]
*  And I knew what work was. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5160.299999999999s)]
*  So we got to get him in a body bag, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5161.139999999999s)]
*  got to find the intel, bring him his body outside, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5162.459999999999s)]
*  blow up a helicopter, call in another helicopter [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5164.62s)]
*  and then hopefully live for 90 minutes [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5167.18s)]
*  and get back to Afghanistan. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5168.22s)]
*  Did you take books? [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5169.58s)]
*  Possibly, I was more working on the computers. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5173.14s)]
*  I was in the, I'd imagine they took [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5176.06s)]
*  pretty much everything they could. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5178.54s)]
*  How many people were killed in the raid? [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5181.3s)]
*  Four, one, two, three, four, five. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5183.06s)]
*  Five. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5185.78s)]
*  Yeah, we killed the courier, the other courier, [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5186.62s)]
*  his wife, Khalid and then Osama. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5188.58s)]
*  What happened to Osama Bin Laden's body? [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5191.18s)]
*  Well, when we got back to Bagram, [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5193.5s)]
*  we flew him to Jalalabad. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5195.54s)]
*  We showed him to the woman that found him. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5197.58s)]
*  We showed him to the CIA targeter. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5200.06s)]
*  She was there, she wanted to see him [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5201.86s)]
*  and she saw him, said, I guess I'm out of a job and left. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5202.86s)]
*  That's it? [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5206.82s)]
*  She didn't even stick around. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5207.66s)]
*  She said, yeah, she kind of looked down like, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5208.5s)]
*  I guess I'm out of a fucking job. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5209.34s)]
*  She was the only reason we were there because of her [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5210.54s)]
*  and she gave up her life to find him. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5213.26s)]
*  She was so cool. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5214.66s)]
*  No husband, no kids, 20 hours a day only on this. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5215.82s)]
*  And once she saw him, that's it. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5218.86s)]
*  Like when I saw her later, I said, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5220.7s)]
*  cause no one at the agency believed her, really? [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5222.1s)]
*  Like 70% maybe. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5224.98s)]
*  And when they got back, she said that everybody got awards [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5226.86s)]
*  and I didn't even get a parking spot. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5229.86s)]
*  Yeah, but we showed them. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5232.339999999999s)]
*  She sounds like a hard case. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5233.54s)]
*  She's bad ass. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5234.66s)]
*  She's like, if anyone knows her, hire her. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5235.58s)]
*  I'm not gonna say her name or what she looks like, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5237.9s)]
*  but yeah, hire, that's an important. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5239.74s)]
*  Do you have any idea what happened to her? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5241.98s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5243.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean, I've heard, no, I don't know. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5244.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably on Wall Street or something. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5246.82s)]
*  She should be. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5249.66s)]
*  But yeah, we brought it back to J-Bad. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5251.419999999999s)]
*  We showed them to Admiral McRaven. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5252.94s)]
*  Who was awesome. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5255.379999999999s)]
*  And he, you know, we, yeah, we had just a moment [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5257.0199999999995s)]
*  looking at him and I remember he put his hand on my neck, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5259.78s)]
*  kind of like that. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5261.7s)]
*  It was like a really, just a cool team thing. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5262.54s)]
*  Like here's the boss, here's the guys, there's Bin Laden. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5264.5s)]
*  What was Bin Laden wearing? [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5267.339999999999s)]
*  He had on a, I think it was like pajamas, [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5268.58s)]
*  like white pajamas. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5270.7s)]
*  Might've been gray. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5272.259999999999s)]
*  It's kind of hazy for me. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5273.379999999999s)]
*  But then we brought him to Bagram, laid him out. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5275.259999999999s)]
*  They were doing the DNA tests. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5279.339999999999s)]
*  And this was a weird time for me too, [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5281.0599999999995s)]
*  because we're still in our gear. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5282.419999999999s)]
*  We laid out all of our intel. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5283.3s)]
*  The smart people are going over that. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5284.9800000000005s)]
*  The TV was on and they brought us breakfast sandwiches. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5286.66s)]
*  And President Obama with a red tie came down the red carpet [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5291.06s)]
*  and he said, tonight I can report to the people [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5294.18s)]
*  and to the world. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5295.860000000001s)]
*  The United States conducted an operation [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5296.860000000001s)]
*  that killed Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaeda. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5298.34s)]
*  I hear President Obama say Osama Bin Laden. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5300.62s)]
*  I looked at Osama Bin Laden and I thought, [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5303.18s)]
*  how in the world did I get hit from Butte, Montana? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5305.46s)]
*  And then I had a bite of the sandwich. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5308.58s)]
*  This is the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5309.9800000000005s)]
*  And then we handed him off. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5312.860000000001s)]
*  Oh, and then we were looking at the TV [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5315.18s)]
*  and we're just like, say it, that no one was hurt. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5316.46s)]
*  You gotta say it, say it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5318.660000000001s)]
*  And he finally said, no, Americans were hurt. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5320.18s)]
*  And I thank you, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5321.42s)]
*  because our parents were now watching this back home. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5322.26s)]
*  And they figured out by this point. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5325.02s)]
*  At this point, yes. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5326.58s)]
*  Well, I called my dad before I left on the mission. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5327.9800000000005s)]
*  I couldn't even tell him what we were doing. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5329.820000000001s)]
*  I called him in my gear, in July, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5331.46s)]
*  but I grabbed one of the phones and one of the B-huts. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5332.9400000000005s)]
*  And I called him and I would call him on missions before. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5335.3s)]
*  And I would just say, hey, gotta go to work, whatever. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5338.06s)]
*  And he would always say, I wish I was going with you. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5340.02s)]
*  And I would say, you know what, dad, I wish you were too. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5342.78s)]
*  And this one, I called him and I just was saying, [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5344.179999999999s)]
*  hey, you know, thanks for teaching me how to be a man. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5346.379999999999s)]
*  I gotta go to work. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5349.9s)]
*  And he said, I wish I was going with you. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5350.74s)]
*  And I said, well, I'm with some really good guys, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5352.86s)]
*  don't worry. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5354.62s)]
*  And then I left and he was at home, [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5355.78s)]
*  and I'm getting a little emotional now. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5357.54s)]
*  He was at home in a Walmart parking lot. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5358.54s)]
*  And he sort of realized that we're going [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5362.099999999999s)]
*  somewhere important. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5364.78s)]
*  He didn't know I was overseas. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5365.86s)]
*  And he went into Walmart and he ran into his sister, [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5366.86s)]
*  who's a registered nurse. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5369.5s)]
*  And she saw him. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5370.94s)]
*  And my dad says, he was his two favorite words, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5372.62s)]
*  apoplectic and catatonic. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5376.219999999999s)]
*  And she said, what's going on? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5378.98s)]
*  And he goes, I don't know, I think something's going on. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5380.0599999999995s)]
*  And then we got back and he saw the TV and said, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5382.58s)]
*  holy shit, because my dad always thought [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5384.38s)]
*  that I was on the big mission. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5386.98s)]
*  And he's gonna think that was it. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5388.42s)]
*  And he was, I even called my mom. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5390.5s)]
*  I'd been joking with my mom my entire life, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5392.259999999999s)]
*  even in high school. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5394.219999999999s)]
*  I would say, don't worry about me, mom. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5395.38s)]
*  I'm here to do something important. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5396.74s)]
*  I'm gonna be safe. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5398.099999999999s)]
*  Don't worry, I'm here to do something important. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5398.94s)]
*  And I called her from Bagram and I said, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5400.74s)]
*  hey mom, you can start worrying. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5402.099999999999s)]
*  Because that important thing, I think it just went down. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5403.74s)]
*  That's amazing. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5408.34s)]
*  And then we handed them to the army [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5409.179999999999s)]
*  and they flew them out to a ship and threw them [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5410.219999999999s)]
*  over into the ocean is what they told me. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5413.7s)]
*  Not only is that an amazing story, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5416.099999999999s)]
*  you did an amazing job telling it. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5417.7s)]
*  How long after you killed Osama did you get out of the Navy? [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5420.46s)]
*  My end of obligated service was January of 12. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5426.46s)]
*  So I was gonna get out then, but then on August 6th of 11, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5431.02s)]
*  extortion 17 was shot down. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5435.7s)]
*  We had 31 Americans on board and some Afghans. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5437.7s)]
*  And we lost a lot of guys from SEAL Team Six on that. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5440.82s)]
*  I knew pretty much everyone on that helicopter. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5442.7s)]
*  So then I was definitely gonna get out [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5446.7s)]
*  because I wanna see my daughters get married. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5448.42s)]
*  And the unfortunate truth. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5450.34s)]
*  So what, I mean, that changed your perspective? [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5451.86s)]
*  Yeah, because it can all, everything that's ever mattered [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5454.82s)]
*  to you can end with one bullet. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5458.46s)]
*  And a bullet never lies and it needs to be right once. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5461.259999999999s)]
*  But then we also had to backfill those guys [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5465.54s)]
*  because we lost a troop of SEAL Team Six guys. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5467.54s)]
*  So I went to a different squadron to deploy one more time. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5470.62s)]
*  And my thought process was I came in through the front door, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5475.299999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna leave through the front door. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5480.42s)]
*  So I'm gonna go to war one more time to prove [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5481.98s)]
*  that I didn't just come here to kill Bin Laden. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5484.3s)]
*  I'm gonna do one more deployment. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5486.42s)]
*  So I, and actually Bin Laden wasn't the last guy [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5487.42s)]
*  I killed with that gun. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5489.14s)]
*  I went overseas again and I went with Silver Squadron. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5490.66s)]
*  We had a winter deployment. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5494.02s)]
*  Got in a couple of fights, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5496.54s)]
*  but it was winter in Afghanistan. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5497.38s)]
*  So not a lot. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5498.3s)]
*  My, actually my last mission was an L ambush, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5499.14s)]
*  which is the oldest tactic in war. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5501.820000000001s)]
*  The only time I've ever done it is when you set up an L [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5505.46s)]
*  and someone either walks or drives right into it [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5507.38s)]
*  and you got them in two ways. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5509.22s)]
*  So we were able to do that with a vehicle. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5510.26s)]
*  We were watching a vehicle start in his village, [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5513.54s)]
*  drive around a mountain. [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5517.06s)]
*  This is Afghanistan. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5518.46s)]
*  In Afghanistan. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5519.3s)]
*  And then they were waiting for Americans to ambush [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5520.14s)]
*  and Americans didn't show up on Monday. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5522.7s)]
*  So they went back to their house. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5524.3s)]
*  They did it again on Tuesday and then we're watching them [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5525.66s)]
*  now and then Wednesday and Thursday. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5527.58s)]
*  And then I remember watching them saying, [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5529.34s)]
*  if they do it tomorrow on Friday, their day of prayer, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5531.3s)]
*  they're definitely gonna do it Saturday. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5533.94s)]
*  So if they do it tomorrow, [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5535.38s)]
*  we're gonna set up on them Saturday. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5537.14s)]
*  So they did it Friday. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5538.3s)]
*  Now we're gonna set up on them. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5539.74s)]
*  And this is the winter, it was a car [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5540.86s)]
*  and no one else is driving this road. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5542.82s)]
*  So we just, we inserted, we set up on these rocks, [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5544.82s)]
*  put some snipers up. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5547.139999999999s)]
*  So we have an L ambush and we're gonna wait for them. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5548.0599999999995s)]
*  And everything that can go wrong will, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5551.62s)]
*  no matter what you're doing. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5554.3s)]
*  The mission was so simple. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5555.58s)]
*  Someone is gonna be in a plane watching them [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5557.9s)]
*  and then they're gonna give us a green light, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5560.179999999999s)]
*  yellow light, red. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5562.3s)]
*  And that's when we're gonna pop out. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5563.54s)]
*  And even I was even telling the army when we're selling them, [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5565.139999999999s)]
*  like, yeah, I'm gonna pop out and I'm gonna stop the car. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5566.86s)]
*  And he's like, well, what if he doesn't stop? [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5568.38s)]
*  I'm like, I'm gonna shoot him. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5569.54s)]
*  This is pretty easy. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5571.259999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna tell him to stop. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5572.14s)]
*  And then if he doesn't, I'm gonna kill him. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5572.9800000000005s)]
*  And the snipers will. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5573.820000000001s)]
*  So we set up there and naturally their car wouldn't start. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5575.46s)]
*  So we actually took out cigars and lit them up, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5578.660000000001s)]
*  waiting for them to try to figure out [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5580.9800000000005s)]
*  how to start their car. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5582.22s)]
*  So they're on this other side of this mountain. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5583.9400000000005s)]
*  We're waiting over here. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5585.38s)]
*  Car won't start. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5586.26s)]
*  Like I almost wanna walk over there and help them [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5587.700000000001s)]
*  put it in gear and jump it. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5589.860000000001s)]
*  And then I'll run back to the rocks. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5591.34s)]
*  But then we're waiting on them [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5592.860000000001s)]
*  and we're starting to get the calls. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5593.9400000000005s)]
*  And a van full of women and children drives right past us. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5595.34s)]
*  And it's like, what was that? [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5599.42s)]
*  Where did they come from? [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5601.46s)]
*  Imagine if we weren't well trained [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5602.9800000000005s)]
*  and we just lit up an entire family for no reason. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5604.1s)]
*  So a van drove by and then these dudes finally drive up [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5606.5s)]
*  and we step out and I tell him to stop [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5608.9400000000005s)]
*  and he didn't wanna stop. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5611.700000000001s)]
*  So we killed him. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5613.46s)]
*  They tried to get out, cut their RPGs [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5615.54s)]
*  and we killed five of them, I think. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5616.740000000001s)]
*  And that was it, last mission. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5618.22s)]
*  And then- [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5620.38s)]
*  The same rifle you used to shoot Bin Laden. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5621.22s)]
*  What happened to that rifle? [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5622.660000000001s)]
*  Then I brought it back and I asked them if I could keep it [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5623.5s)]
*  and they said no. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5626.860000000001s)]
*  So I turned the gun in. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5627.9800000000005s)]
*  And I don't know if someone else got it. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5630.18s)]
*  I don't know if they hung it up somewhere. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5631.58s)]
*  I don't know what- [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5632.58s)]
*  You have no idea what happened to the rifle. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5633.42s)]
*  I kept the firing pin though. [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5634.900000000001s)]
*  So I have that, but they kept the gun. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5636.1s)]
*  So they might've given it to some, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5638.860000000001s)]
*  one of those radio guys that is gonna skydive [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5640.38s)]
*  for the first time and just happen to be carrying [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5642.740000000001s)]
*  the Bin Laden gun. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5644.14s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5645.34s)]
*  Did you tell him this is the Bin Laden gun? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5646.26s)]
*  Everybody knew. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5647.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and even the gunner's man. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5649.660000000001s)]
*  He was cool, he let me keep the firing pin. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5650.5s)]
*  But even the gunner's man, I was like, [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5651.900000000001s)]
*  EJ, come on, dude, let me keep the gun. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5652.9800000000005s)]
*  I'll give you $10,000 for the gun. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5654.900000000001s)]
*  What kind of gun was it? [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5656.26s)]
*  H&K 416. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5657.18s)]
*  Good gun. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5658.700000000001s)]
*  Never had an issue. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5659.58s)]
*  Never had a jam with that gun. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5660.42s)]
*  So you come back from your last appointment [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5662.06s)]
*  to Afghanistan and then- [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5663.820000000001s)]
*  Well, then I get done and I have, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5665.34s)]
*  I had a bunch of terminal leave, they call it. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5668.1s)]
*  You get 30 days of paid leave a year [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5671.54s)]
*  and I hadn't taken any. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5673.46s)]
*  So I have like 90 days of leave [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5674.700000000001s)]
*  where I can still get paid, [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5676.900000000001s)]
*  which is good because now I have until August [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5678.22s)]
*  to figure out how to get a job. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5680.34s)]
*  Because it's weird to leave the military without a degree [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5683.54s)]
*  because I know guys now that would, [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5686.139999999999s)]
*  they'd rather go to war than fill out a resume [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5687.42s)]
*  because war makes sense. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5689.099999999999s)]
*  The resume does. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5690.38s)]
*  I don't know what shoes to wear with a suit, [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5691.22s)]
*  crap like that. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5692.86s)]
*  So I had to learn what to do. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5694.139999999999s)]
*  And I'm fortunate that I can tell a story. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5697.5s)]
*  I'm fortunate that I can manage stress and solve problems. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5699.22s)]
*  I got on the speaking circuit. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5702.62s)]
*  Again, just being present. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5703.98s)]
*  Got offered with leading authorities out of DC. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5707.22s)]
*  And the first speech I gave was to, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5710.0599999999995s)]
*  I think 2000 airline pilots. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5711.94s)]
*  And I had no experience speaking, never taken a class. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5714.38s)]
*  And I remember being backstage looking out at his audience. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5717.82s)]
*  I'm like, I called my agent and I'm like, [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5720.78s)]
*  hey, I've been to combat, [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5722.18s)]
*  but am I gonna faint when I get out on stage? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5724.1s)]
*  I have never been looked at like this. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5725.74s)]
*  And she said to me, here's what you do. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5727.58s)]
*  Here's the key. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5729.54s)]
*  Three glasses of red wine right now. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5730.38s)]
*  Not two and not four. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5732.62s)]
*  That was her prescription. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5733.74s)]
*  Three and you'll be fine. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5734.66s)]
*  And then I didn't have them, but I walked on stage [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5735.900000000001s)]
*  and they were pilots. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5738.22s)]
*  So there was a lot of Navy guys, [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5739.06s)]
*  a lot of Marines in the audience. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5739.900000000001s)]
*  And one of the Marines, former Marines, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5741.1s)]
*  he kind of heckled me. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5742.82s)]
*  And that clicked like, oh, they're friendly. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5745.3s)]
*  Okay, good, good. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5746.14s)]
*  This is a fun crowd. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5746.9800000000005s)]
*  And so I gave my first speech like that. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5748.1s)]
*  And speaking is just, you can't really market it. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5749.9400000000005s)]
*  If you're good, someone in the audience hears you [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5752.34s)]
*  and hires you. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5754.06s)]
*  So it's like I did one in November and then two in December [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5754.900000000001s)]
*  and then five in January and then 10 in February. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5757.06s)]
*  And I just started speaking [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5759.38s)]
*  and then helped guys transition. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5760.22s)]
*  How was your transition? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5763.66s)]
*  I mean, it was difficult because, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5765.38s)]
*  I don't necessarily miss the missions, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5767.900000000001s)]
*  but I miss the guys. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5769.900000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5770.9400000000005s)]
*  The skydive trips to Arizona, there's nothing like those. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5771.78s)]
*  Skydiving with 30 of your best friends. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5774.740000000001s)]
*  Going out to dinner when you're done jumping, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5775.860000000001s)]
*  talking about how close that jump was [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5777.1s)]
*  and then jumping the next day. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5779.46s)]
*  And I miss that. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5780.42s)]
*  I miss the workouts, the morning stuff. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5782.46s)]
*  Because even at SEAL Team 2, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5784.06s)]
*  every Tuesday, rain or shine, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5786.820000000001s)]
*  we had the two mile ocean swim. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5787.9800000000005s)]
*  And I'm talking like February in Virginia Beach [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5789.860000000001s)]
*  is not fun to do it. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5791.620000000001s)]
*  But the bus ride to get there is hilarious. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5792.860000000001s)]
*  Just because it just sucks. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5795.02s)]
*  And we all know we're just going to take a big bite [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5796.580000000001s)]
*  of this shit sandwich, but we're all in it together. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5798.46s)]
*  Let's go swim. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5799.9800000000005s)]
*  I miss that. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5801.06s)]
*  If I never do an ocean swim again, that's fine. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5802.46s)]
*  But I do miss that bus ride. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5804.18s)]
*  What is PTSD? [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5806.34s)]
*  PTSD is real. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5810.26s)]
*  And it takes for me and a lot of my friends, [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5811.7s)]
*  a lot of my Marines, a lot of SEALs, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5814.22s)]
*  some of them don't have it, [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5817.38s)]
*  but for me, it seemed like a seven year thing. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5818.34s)]
*  Like right around the seven year mark, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5821.18s)]
*  it starts to sink in what you were doing. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5822.7s)]
*  Seven years out? [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5824.46s)]
*  Seven years out of the Navy is when it started to hit me. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5825.3s)]
*  Really? [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5827.86s)]
*  And that's just. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5828.7s)]
*  Had you ever had any symptoms [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5829.9s)]
*  of what you would now describe as PTSD [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5832.299999999999s)]
*  when you were serving in the Navy? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5833.9s)]
*  No. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5835.099999999999s)]
*  Or for the first seven years out? [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5835.94s)]
*  No. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5837.099999999999s)]
*  How interesting. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5837.94s)]
*  Yeah, it just seemed like [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5838.78s)]
*  that's what we were supposed to be doing. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5839.78s)]
*  But then you get older and you realize [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5840.82s)]
*  that I was in houses killing people [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5843.54s)]
*  in front of their families. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5845.54s)]
*  I mean, even to the point where you're like, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5846.74s)]
*  okay, I did kill that guy in front of his two sons. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5848.0199999999995s)]
*  Now, did I get rid of a terrorist or I make two new ones? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5849.82s)]
*  What are they going to do when they get older? [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5852.86s)]
*  What are they doing now, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5853.94s)]
*  now that they're in their twenties? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5854.78s)]
*  I mean, they're not going to forget me [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5856.259999999999s)]
*  killing their dad in front of them. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5857.099999999999s)]
*  The guy that I killed in front of his wife, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5859.34s)]
*  and I killed his brother right before I killed him [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5861.02s)]
*  in front of his wife. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5862.46s)]
*  They still remember that. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5863.74s)]
*  They still hate my guts. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5864.62s)]
*  So you start to think about, [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5866.22s)]
*  I mean, I'm convinced I never killed the wrong person, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5867.06s)]
*  but also I started to think, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5870.54s)]
*  could I have talked them out of that? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5872.46s)]
*  Because the one guy that I talk about, [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5874.7s)]
*  I try to talk them out of getting his gun. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5875.900000000001s)]
*  Like he got up and was trying to kick me. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5877.7s)]
*  Where was this? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5879.820000000001s)]
*  What happened? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5880.66s)]
*  It was in Ramadi, Iraq. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5881.5s)]
*  We just went into a house and as soon as we went in, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5882.62s)]
*  it was a big like Saddam mansion type place. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5885.58s)]
*  As soon as I went in, there's a guy with a gun. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5888.1s)]
*  So I blasted him. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5889.34s)]
*  Then other guys were coming in. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5891.06s)]
*  There's an open door here and I did a one man entry, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5892.700000000001s)]
*  which he shouldn't do, but I went in there [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5894.860000000001s)]
*  and there's a guy in bed with his wife [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5896.46s)]
*  and I'm standing above him and I can see a gun [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5898.42s)]
*  and he's right there and he's waking up. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5901.700000000001s)]
*  And he like, he threw a kick or something. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5902.860000000001s)]
*  And I remember thinking, okay, he just woke up, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5904.820000000001s)]
*  give him a courtesy 10 seconds, [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5907.700000000001s)]
*  cause he's groggy. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5909.54s)]
*  And then he starts looking at the gun [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5911.38s)]
*  and I was like, no, don't do that. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5912.46s)]
*  Don't do it. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5914.5s)]
*  And he went for it and I killed him. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5915.34s)]
*  And then I put a white light on him [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5916.160000000001s)]
*  and his wife now sees him. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5917.78s)]
*  And so she screams. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5919.54s)]
*  And then I'm like, why? [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5921.54s)]
*  And then later I started thinking, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5922.86s)]
*  why did I shoot that guy? [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5924.3s)]
*  Well, because he went for his gun, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5925.26s)]
*  but why did he go for a gun? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5926.26s)]
*  Well, cause I'm in his room at two in the morning. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5927.42s)]
*  And then you start thinking, why am I in his room? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5929.0599999999995s)]
*  Well, George Bush had a problem with Saddam Hussein. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5930.94s)]
*  So we invaded Iraq and that's why I just killed that guy. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5932.62s)]
*  And again, everything that ever mattered to that dude, [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5934.74s)]
*  doesn't matter anymore [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5937.42s)]
*  cause I just took it all away from him. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5938.26s)]
*  So that, and that just starts to, you know, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5940.38s)]
*  that can eat you up sometime. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5942.139999999999s)]
*  Me, anyway, some guys don't have a problem with any of it. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5943.5s)]
*  And he was a terrorist, so whatever. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5945.26s)]
*  But you still think about it. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5947.34s)]
*  And the thing that I bring up too, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5948.34s)]
*  is if I had met that dude in Paris over coffee, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5949.9800000000005s)]
*  did he know a joke? [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5952.74s)]
*  You know, that's the weird shit. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5954.42s)]
*  And then for me, it's PTSD is anger, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5955.74s)]
*  like a quick anger and then hyper awareness. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5958.9800000000005s)]
*  Like even if I'm downstairs making a sandwich in my kitchen, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5962.54s)]
*  I gotta be looking at the doors [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5964.860000000001s)]
*  just to make sure no one's coming in, you know, [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5966.26s)]
*  yelling at the wife for not locking the door, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5968.26s)]
*  arm the alarm, here's the shotguns, here's how it works. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5970.38s)]
*  And she probably doesn't need to know all of that. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5972.62s)]
*  But that's just, that's part of it. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5975.26s)]
*  Because one of my sayings is it's a large planet, [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5976.46s)]
*  but it's a small world. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5979.5s)]
*  And people can get here really, really quickly. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5981.1s)]
*  And we've done it to them. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5982.58s)]
*  And they can do it to us. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5984.02s)]
*  And it's one of those things that it's so dark and bad. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5985.7s)]
*  And I know what people are capable of doing to each other. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5987.78s)]
*  And I don't wanna see it again. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5989.86s)]
*  But, you know, if they come here, I mean, I'm ready for them. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5991.9s)]
*  But you get an October 7th type thing in this country, [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5995.3s)]
*  people are not prepared for what they might see. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=5998.34s)]
*  Because people are worse than animals as far as violence. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6001.26s)]
*  We can do some of the most horrific shit to each other. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6004.66s)]
*  And that gets to me, to the point where, [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6007.1s)]
*  like I do Ibogaine now, I do psychedelics. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6008.14s)]
*  I'm actually going back down with a company called Ambio [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6011.18s)]
*  in a couple of weeks to do Ibogaine. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6013.54s)]
*  I do it once a year just because [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6015.5s)]
*  when I start to get a short temper, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6016.9400000000005s)]
*  like if I have to have green noise on to sleep [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6020.1s)]
*  so I can't hear what's going on in my head, [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6023.06s)]
*  it's just time to get back into the psychedelics. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6024.860000000001s)]
*  And what the psychedelics do is they get me structured. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6026.66s)]
*  So there's like a four or five month window for Ibogaine [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6030.820000000001s)]
*  that it works and that's when you're supposed [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6034.62s)]
*  to structure yourself. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6036.099999999999s)]
*  So like for me, it'll be the barefoot walking in the grass [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6037.5s)]
*  at least five minutes after you wake up [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6042.14s)]
*  and before you go to bed. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6043.66s)]
*  And then meditation, yoga and working out. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6045.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, you gotta work out. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6047.38s)]
*  Just get the endorphins going. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6048.66s)]
*  But Ibogaine helps you get back in that. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6050.26s)]
*  And then once you're in that system, [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6051.58s)]
*  then you can stick with it. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6052.78s)]
*  So that's how it helps. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6054.22s)]
*  But yeah, PTSD can be anything. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6055.98s)]
*  I've seen guys try to drink their way out of it, [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6057.94s)]
*  which is horrible. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6060.94s)]
*  Because it's like, I've had friends say, [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6062.26s)]
*  I'll take a drink of alcohol to get rid of the pain, [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6063.86s)]
*  but then I gotta have one more drink of alcohol [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6065.78s)]
*  to get rid of the pain. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6067.74s)]
*  And then I'll wake up the next day, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6068.58s)]
*  I'll have a hangover, but you know what, [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6069.42s)]
*  we'll get rid of it, another drink. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6070.26s)]
*  And it's a vicious cycle. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6071.62s)]
*  Isn't there? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6072.86s)]
*  But the alcohol doesn't help. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6073.7s)]
*  The psychedelics do and that's why they're not legal here, [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6075.18s)]
*  because it works. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6077.14s)]
*  And I don't know why they won't help the veterans with that. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6078.14s)]
*  I think they're working on it now. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6079.78s)]
*  I know there's a company also in Texas [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6081.74s)]
*  called Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6083.46s)]
*  And they partner with Ambio and we get veterans [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6085.34s)]
*  and first responders to Mexico, [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6087.22s)]
*  but we should have it in New York at the VA. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6088.38s)]
*  We should have it in Virginia and California. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6090.0599999999995s)]
*  Veterans should be able to get Ibogaine [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6091.82s)]
*  administered medically. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6094.179999999999s)]
*  And that's how they do it in Mexico. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6095.54s)]
*  It's a doctor, you're on a heart monitor, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6096.74s)]
*  they watch you the whole time [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6098.58s)]
*  and it just gets in your brain, it shows you stuff [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6099.66s)]
*  and it really, it kind of cleans out the closet. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6102.58s)]
*  It's terrifying. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6105.0599999999995s)]
*  Ibogaine is, DMT is not, it's awesome, [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6107.259999999999s)]
*  but it breaks everything up [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6109.0599999999995s)]
*  and then it kind of pushes it out for you. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6111.0199999999995s)]
*  Why is it terrifying? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6112.099999999999s)]
*  Because it opens your, [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6113.74s)]
*  like when people say you use 30% of your brain, [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6115.94s)]
*  it's like you use 30% for tennis [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6117.98s)]
*  and then a different 30% for chess [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6119.62s)]
*  or for whatever, but this one opens all of them [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6121.42s)]
*  and it all talks. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6123.54s)]
*  And so stuff that you've suppressed, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6124.86s)]
*  trauma as far back as your childhood, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6126.9800000000005s)]
*  it'll show it to you. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6129.26s)]
*  That you wanted to stop thinking about [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6131.1s)]
*  and then you have to deal, [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6132.58s)]
*  like you have to deal with it. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6133.42s)]
*  Like the medicine shows you things [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6134.9800000000005s)]
*  and you can tell it, [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6137.02s)]
*  I don't want to, I'm not ready to see that right now, [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6138.1s)]
*  but if it keeps, like for me, it's demons. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6139.9400000000005s)]
*  If it keeps showing you stuff, [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6142.06s)]
*  you have to deal with it right now. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6143.82s)]
*  Demons? [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6145.02s)]
*  Demons, like black gum, yellow teeth demons. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6145.86s)]
*  Yeah, just staring at me. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6148.1s)]
*  At first and then it gets rid of them. [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6150.26s)]
*  But. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6152.22s)]
*  What do you think those are? [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6153.06s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6153.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6154.74s)]
*  It's hard to say. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6157.06s)]
*  I mean, it's just an evil phase, [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6157.9s)]
*  but it's a bunch of them. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6158.9s)]
*  And then with your mind working, if you're. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6160.62s)]
*  Do you think they're real? [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6163.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6164.9800000000005s)]
*  I think so too. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6166.82s)]
*  I do. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6167.66s)]
*  I think there's real evil in the world too. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6168.5s)]
*  And guys like me that were never supposed [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6170.1s)]
*  to be killing people, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6171.42s)]
*  they're going to taunt me a little bit. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6172.82s)]
*  But when your mind gets creative. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6174.54s)]
*  What do you mean guys like you [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6175.74s)]
*  who were never supposed to be killing people? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6176.82s)]
*  No, I wasn't supposed to be a killer. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6177.66s)]
*  I was supposed to be a chef. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6180.0599999999995s)]
*  I was supposed to be a stockbroker. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6181.66s)]
*  So, I mean, I have a big heart. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6183.86s)]
*  Like I don't want people to go to war. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6185.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't want people to be shooting each other. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6187.74s)]
*  I don't want bombs dropping on innocent people. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6189.22s)]
*  Yes. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6191.18s)]
*  But when you went under Ibogaine, [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6192.0199999999995s)]
*  as creative as you can get, [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6193.5s)]
*  you can start thinking of horrible shit. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6194.9s)]
*  And because you're in a state, you actually see it. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6196.78s)]
*  You can see it. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6200.78s)]
*  It's a vision of like awful, awful shit. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6201.62s)]
*  And so you have to deal with that. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6205.78s)]
*  But it goes back and forth [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6207.219999999999s)]
*  and the medicine kind of like guide you. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6208.219999999999s)]
*  And the coolest thing it said to me was [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6210.62s)]
*  the only people who go to hell [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6213.139999999999s)]
*  are people who think they deserve to. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6214.299999999999s)]
*  So it's a healer, but it's really scary. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6216.139999999999s)]
*  And then there's a 24 hour period [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6219.54s)]
*  where it's like a really bad hangover. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6222.5s)]
*  You're depleted. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6224.379999999999s)]
*  So you get a bunch of IVs and stuff. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6225.219999999999s)]
*  You do a Reiki massage, which is an energy massage. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6226.419999999999s)]
*  And then they give you five MEO DMT, [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6228.46s)]
*  which is the God molecule. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6230.74s)]
*  And you go to, you go wherever heaven is [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6233.099999999999s)]
*  and you see it, you lose track of time. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6235.9s)]
*  The first time I did five MEO, [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6238.42s)]
*  I asked them when I was done, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6240.139999999999s)]
*  how many days have I been asleep? [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6241.259999999999s)]
*  And they said a minute and a half [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6242.5s)]
*  because you lose track of every, [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6243.86s)]
*  like you can't describe it. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6245.0199999999995s)]
*  And I've heard other people talk about psychedelics. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6246.099999999999s)]
*  You can't, it's the most beautiful time lapse. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6248.379999999999s)]
*  Like you lose track of time [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6253.58s)]
*  and I feel like I'm being lifted by my stomach. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6254.74s)]
*  And there's like, there's family everywhere [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6257.94s)]
*  and a maternal voice. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6259.98s)]
*  And it was telling me I was home, [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6262.259999999999s)]
*  but in a language I didn't understand, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6264.0599999999995s)]
*  but I couldn't understand it, [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6266.34s)]
*  but I knew what she was saying. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6267.18s)]
*  And like my grandmother, my dead grandmother was there [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6268.54s)]
*  and she was just saying, we're not waiting for you. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6270.7s)]
*  We're just here. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6272.54s)]
*  Like we're here now. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6273.42s)]
*  Like, and it sounds crazy right now, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6275.0199999999995s)]
*  but it's- [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6276.98s)]
*  It doesn't sound crazy. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6277.82s)]
*  It'll really, it really opens your mind to what next? [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6278.66s)]
*  It's, I mean, everyone that's done it too. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6284.3s)]
*  Like I went through with, I'm talking Sergeant Major [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6285.66s)]
*  and Delta Force guys, 30 years in the army. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6289.34s)]
*  And they finished this Ibogaine Reiki DMT [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6293.5s)]
*  and they told me to give a message to Amber Capone. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6296.7s)]
*  She just, she runs this, [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6300.54s)]
*  Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6302.38s)]
*  Please tell Amber that she saved my life [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6304.18s)]
*  because I was gonna kill myself next week. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6305.66s)]
*  This was my last shot at doing something for myself. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6307.3s)]
*  And it cured him. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6309.42s)]
*  It's cured heroin addiction overnight. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6310.9s)]
*  Like dope sickness. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6313.9s)]
*  Like I heard a story of a woman that was addicted to heroin [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6314.86s)]
*  and she did Ibogaine, didn't have any visions, just slept. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6318.18s)]
*  And she said, I don't think it worked. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6320.86s)]
*  And they said, well, are you dope sick? [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6321.94s)]
*  And she goes, no. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6322.98s)]
*  And he goes, well, it worked. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6323.82s)]
*  So now just set your patterns. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6325.94s)]
*  So it's, I mean, every veteran that's seen combat should, [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6327.82s)]
*  shit, everyone that's had any trauma in their life [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6330.62s)]
*  should get a shot at Ibogaine. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6332.5s)]
*  Cause it's a life changer. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6334.259999999999s)]
*  What are the symptoms of PTSD? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6338.459999999999s)]
*  You said anger and paranoia. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6339.9s)]
*  I'm paraphrasing. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6342.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just awareness. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6343.259999999999s)]
*  Awareness, hyper awareness. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6344.099999999999s)]
*  But like over aware. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6344.94s)]
*  Like I can't concentrate on the show [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6346.459999999999s)]
*  cause I'm always looking at the door. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6347.74s)]
*  And then the anger, I mean, that's not me. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6349.86s)]
*  I don't like getting angry, [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6351.66s)]
*  but I'll just, I'll get really pissed off in them. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6352.5s)]
*  Where do you think that comes from? [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6354.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's just gotta be all the stuff that we saw [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6355.94s)]
*  because even, you know, shooting people is one thing. [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6358.9s)]
*  Not all of them bother me. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6362.0199999999995s)]
*  A couple of them bother me just because [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6363.38s)]
*  you kind of what if I did it differently. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6365.18s)]
*  But then, you know, you see other dead people. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6368.18s)]
*  You have friends like the worst conversation [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6369.7s)]
*  is when someone would come up to me and say, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6373.74s)]
*  hey, did you know Scott Neal? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6374.9s)]
*  What do you mean did I know? [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6377.099999999999s)]
*  What happened? [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6378.3s)]
*  You know, did you know Rob Reeves? [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6379.38s)]
*  Yes. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6380.74s)]
*  What happened? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6381.58s)]
*  You know, did you know? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6382.98s)]
*  It's like, I knew what happened. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6383.82s)]
*  Did you know Neil Roberts was the first one I heard Fifi, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6385.7s)]
*  the guy that fell out of the helicopter, [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6387.9s)]
*  we were a team in Afghanistan. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6390.42s)]
*  And yeah, I knew him. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6392.42s)]
*  He's the first SEAL I met. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6393.9s)]
*  We went to Arby's my first day cause he was an older guy [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6395.3s)]
*  and he brought two new guys to Arby's [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6397.82s)]
*  to tell us what SEAL Team Two was like. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6398.9s)]
*  Yeah, I know him. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6400.099999999999s)]
*  I knew him. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6400.94s)]
*  So just losing friends and knowing their families, [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6402.0199999999995s)]
*  I think it's a lot. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6404.86s)]
*  I mean, and it's like anything, [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6405.7s)]
*  like just the older you get, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6406.78s)]
*  the more shit you start to realize. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6407.7s)]
*  Of course. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6409.7s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot of dramatic stuff. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6410.54s)]
*  Even like, I remember a house I went into in Iraq [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6411.78s)]
*  and we're going into two, three in the morning. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6416.42s)]
*  I went into the wrong house [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6418.099999999999s)]
*  and the only people inside was a woman and her young daughter. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6419.26s)]
*  And I'm standing, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6422.66s)]
*  they came out of the room to look at me. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6423.5s)]
*  Here's some dude with a green face and a gun [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6424.9s)]
*  getting muddled over the white carpet, wrong house. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6428.34s)]
*  And I remember looking at him just thinking, [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6430.42s)]
*  I understand why they hate us. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6432.3s)]
*  I wouldn't want to wake up to this guy in my house. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6434.22s)]
*  No, not at all. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6436.22s)]
*  And just thinking, what did I, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6437.0599999999995s)]
*  I traumatized that poor young girl for nothing. [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6437.9s)]
*  So just shit like that. [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6440.86s)]
*  Maybe I'm too sensitive. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6442.0599999999995s)]
*  But they asked a lot of us. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6443.179999999999s)]
*  We did a lot of stuff over there. [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6445.219999999999s)]
*  What are you haunted by? [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6447.58s)]
*  Is it, are you more haunted? [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6452.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, I can see probably haunted by everything. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6453.58s)]
*  Why wouldn't you be? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6455.0599999999995s)]
*  But is it the killing or the seeing? [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6455.9s)]
*  No, you know what it is. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6458.86s)]
*  It's haunted by stuff that's probably not going to happen, [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6459.94s)]
*  but I'm anticipating it. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6463.139999999999s)]
*  The October 7th style attack on a gun free zone [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6464.339999999999s)]
*  in Arizona, when suicide bombers go to an elementary school, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6468.38s)]
*  when the sleeper cells activate [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6472.42s)]
*  and they're cutting heads off somewhere, that bothers me. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6473.26s)]
*  It doesn't bother me if they come after me. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6476.0199999999995s)]
*  I can handle them. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6477.26s)]
*  I got them. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6478.1s)]
*  And I'm so morbid sometimes it's like, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6479.26s)]
*  well, if they get me, at least that's an ending finally. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6480.9s)]
*  But no, I mean, I got shotguns, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6483.22s)]
*  like we said yesterday and whatever. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6485.18s)]
*  But just thinking about, [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6486.98s)]
*  I don't like the idea of innocent Americans [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6487.82s)]
*  getting killed here just because political ideologies [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6490.22s)]
*  left our borders wide open and they're here [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6494.66s)]
*  and they haven't forgotten about us. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6497.900000000001s)]
*  They've always said to us that the Americans have the clocks, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6498.740000000001s)]
*  but we have the time and they're not going to forget. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6502.3s)]
*  They hit the World Trade Center in 93. [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6504.42s)]
*  They came back in 2001. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6505.820000000001s)]
*  So that bothers me. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6508.900000000001s)]
*  And it's almost like the idea [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6510.34s)]
*  of something bad happening bothers me. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6511.9400000000005s)]
*  And it probably never will. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6513.860000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't be worried about stuff that won't happen, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6514.820000000001s)]
*  but that's part of my PTSD. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6516.22s)]
*  It's always struck me as weird that combat veterans [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6518.38s)]
*  kill themselves, which they do. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6522.42s)]
*  They do. [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6524.1s)]
*  They have a much higher rate than non-combat veterans, [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6524.98s)]
*  but they survived and some of them really beat the odds [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6527.54s)]
*  to survive. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6530.86s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6531.7s)]
*  And then they went up killing themselves. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6532.62s)]
*  Why? [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6534.139999999999s)]
*  I think again, it's the, they can't live with the guilt. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6536.179999999999s)]
*  Or I know some guys that killed themselves [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6540.7s)]
*  because they had traumatic brain injury [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6542.259999999999s)]
*  and they can't live with the headaches. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6543.299999999999s)]
*  Ibogaine cares that too. [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6544.86s)]
*  I mean, guys need a shot at this. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6546.74s)]
*  They don't need to be taking all the pills [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6547.98s)]
*  the VA gives them. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6549.58s)]
*  What do you mean the guilt? [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6550.54s)]
*  I think just talking to some guys, [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6552.86s)]
*  like some Marines I know from Fallujah, [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6555.98s)]
*  just the killing, the watching guys get killed. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6557.74s)]
*  It's like, could I have saved my friend? [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6560.259999999999s)]
*  Like I'm fortunate. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6562.78s)]
*  I don't think I've ever killed the wrong person. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6563.62s)]
*  I've actually never seen one of my friends [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6565.86s)]
*  hurt in front of me, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6567.219999999999s)]
*  which is crazy going into that much combat. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6568.179999999999s)]
*  But some guys have. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6570.339999999999s)]
*  And some guys, I mean, I was talking to guys [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6571.179999999999s)]
*  that were trying to put their buddy back together [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6573.0199999999995s)]
*  when he was blown in half, like his best friend, [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6575.0199999999995s)]
*  like just that guilt. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6577.379999999999s)]
*  I'm tired of living through this. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6578.7s)]
*  Is there guilt over killing? [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6581.14s)]
*  Not, I don't even think even guilt. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6583.620000000001s)]
*  I do think about that one guy every day, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6584.9800000000005s)]
*  but again, he was a bad guy. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6586.820000000001s)]
*  But could I have talked him out of it? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6588.9400000000005s)]
*  Like, was it worth it? [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6590.22s)]
*  Probably, maybe not, but the unknown. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6591.26s)]
*  And then just, again, wondering how did that affect them? [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6596.02s)]
*  How did that woman that the dog bit, [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6599.820000000001s)]
*  bit her arm or whatever. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6601.9400000000005s)]
*  And just, I mean, because again, why are we here [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6603.660000000001s)]
*  and why are we doing this to this group of people right now? [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6607.54s)]
*  And it was never the weapons of mass destruction. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6610.38s)]
*  Now I'm fighting for the guy that came in the room behind me, [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6613.78s)]
*  the guy who was in front of me. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6615.66s)]
*  That's who I'm fighting for, and we're gonna win. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6616.58s)]
*  And Americans win every fight toe to toe. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6618.06s)]
*  But what's the reason we're here? [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6620.9800000000005s)]
*  You said this hit you and it commonly hits people, [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6623.9800000000005s)]
*  I think you said seven years-ish, years after. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6626.74s)]
*  They're safe and living in some leafy suburb [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6630.22s)]
*  with a pretty wife and like everything's fine, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6632.22s)]
*  but they're not fine inside. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6633.9400000000005s)]
*  How many conversations did you have in all the years [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6636.54s)]
*  you were in all these 12 deployments or whatever [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6638.58s)]
*  about why you were there, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6641.38s)]
*  about the meaning of taking another man's life? [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6643.66s)]
*  We didn't talk about it at all. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6646.7s)]
*  Not when we were in. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6648.42s)]
*  It was just the job. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6649.66s)]
*  The only person that brought it up [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6650.78s)]
*  was one of our personal trainers. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6652.1s)]
*  Because we had these trainers that will do everything [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6654.22s)]
*  from strength coaches to helping you stretch, [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6656.18s)]
*  bad back type stuff. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6657.94s)]
*  And I remember he said, [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6659.22s)]
*  every one of you guys has changed, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6660.62s)]
*  you just don't realize it. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6661.9s)]
*  Like every single one of you guys, [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6662.74s)]
*  you're not the same as you were [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6664.46s)]
*  when you checked in here for selection. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6665.38s)]
*  Like you guys are all different now. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6667.02s)]
*  And it was just because of the missions, [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6668.620000000001s)]
*  whether they admit it or not. [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6671.18s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6672.660000000001s)]
*  We were good at it. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6675.06s)]
*  Well, undoubtedly. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6676.700000000001s)]
*  The best. [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6678.1s)]
*  Just think it's interesting that the US government [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6679.18s)]
*  or your officers, I mean, why is it left [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6682.22s)]
*  to your personal trainer to note something that obvious? [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6686.14s)]
*  I don't think they have interest in mental health [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6691.9800000000005s)]
*  or even helping you separate [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6695.14s)]
*  because you're not sticking around [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6696.46s)]
*  to do the job they needed to do. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6698.22s)]
*  And then they might be getting better now, [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6699.54s)]
*  but I doubt it. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6701.46s)]
*  That they're certainly not doing psychedelic work. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6703.26s)]
*  What about the moral questions? [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6705.06s)]
*  Like how many people you served with [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6706.26s)]
*  were faithful believers in God? [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6708.38s)]
*  A low percent, maybe 5%. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6712.82s)]
*  Wow. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6716.82s)]
*  But the further we're out now, more guys are going back. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6717.66s)]
*  I've noticed. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6721.62s)]
*  A lot of Christians, a lot of, [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6722.46s)]
*  I'm Catholic and I'm going back to church now. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6723.3s)]
*  I didn't go to church. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6724.9800000000005s)]
*  The only time I went to church in the Navy was for funerals. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6726.3s)]
*  And it doesn't make any sense. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6729.26s)]
*  You think I would have been better with Jesus? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6730.58s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6732.660000000001s)]
*  And even when they would bring a pastor out [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6733.740000000001s)]
*  to pray before a mission, we're like, whatever, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6735.14s)]
*  let's go kill these fuckers. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6736.700000000001s)]
*  But now it's kind of like, all right, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6738.5s)]
*  maybe take a rap off that too. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6739.9400000000005s)]
*  Fair. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6742.780000000001s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6744.46s)]
*  I guess I'm making a point, which is it seems like [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6745.820000000001s)]
*  they're treating you like animals or machines. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6749.06s)]
*  They're not considering the effect on you. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6751.58s)]
*  That's just, sorry to say that, but that's the way. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6753.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, they cared about our professional development. [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6756.34s)]
*  They cared about us going to sniper school. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6758.099999999999s)]
*  They cared about doing training, but I can't remember. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6759.5s)]
*  I mean, they, okay, they started to get good with retreats. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6762.54s)]
*  I remember they would do some retreats. [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6765.3s)]
*  Like you get to take your, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6766.74s)]
*  they would pay for you and your wife and kids [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6767.86s)]
*  to go to like Great Wolf Lodge and do the water park. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6769.7s)]
*  And they would have classes about like, [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6771.66s)]
*  it was more marriage counseling [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6773.82s)]
*  because we're all in nuts anyway. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6774.82s)]
*  So they did, they did, [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6777.46s)]
*  I don't want to say they didn't do anything, [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6779.0199999999995s)]
*  but they certainly aren't keying on, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6780.0599999999995s)]
*  it's almost like if someone's got a psychological problem, [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6782.34s)]
*  do we trust them to be the lead jumper on that jump? [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6784.98s)]
*  Do we trust them to be the one man? [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6788.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you see people go crazy? [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6791.42s)]
*  Yeah, I saw people freeze. [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6792.98s)]
*  It's a different animal. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6796.5s)]
*  What does that mean freeze? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6798.179999999999s)]
*  Just freeze. [[01:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6799.94s)]
*  Like if someone shoots an AK-47 at you in a house, [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6800.9s)]
*  it's really loud and scary. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6804.099999999999s)]
*  Can't imagine. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6805.42s)]
*  And I've seen guys just stop. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6806.26s)]
*  I mean, nothing on them. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6809.099999999999s)]
*  People react differently. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6810.86s)]
*  I just say I was just dumb enough to go after them. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6812.3s)]
*  But some guys quit, some guys like, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6814.9800000000005s)]
*  I'm not doing this anymore. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6817.54s)]
*  Soon after Neil Roberts fell out of the helicopter, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6818.46s)]
*  a lot of poster child seals hit it, beat it. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6820.54s)]
*  Can you tell that story quickly? [[01:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6825.06s)]
*  I'm not familiar with it. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6826.58s)]
*  He fell out. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6827.42s)]
*  That's when they were going [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6828.26s)]
*  after Al Qaeda operation in Anaconda. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6829.1s)]
*  And it was mainly, it was like the 10th mountain, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6831.02s)]
*  some army infantry, Delta and SEAL Team Six. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6834.780000000001s)]
*  And they were trying to put SEAL snipers [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6838.26s)]
*  on top of a mountain called Takr Ghar. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6840.22s)]
*  And they were being flown by TF-160, [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6842.900000000001s)]
*  the best pilots in the world. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6844.62s)]
*  Al Mack was actually flying, the best pilot in the world. [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6845.46s)]
*  Razor Zero Three is his book. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6849.1s)]
*  He's so cool. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6850.9800000000005s)]
*  I had a shirt made that said, I know Al Mack. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6852.18s)]
*  Like he's a bad ass. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6854.06s)]
*  But, and he saved everyone's life. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6855.3s)]
*  But when they were inserting, they started taking fire. [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6856.34s)]
*  They got hit with an RPG. [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6857.9400000000005s)]
*  And Neil was on the ramp. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6859.58s)]
*  He was gonna be the first guy off. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6862.54s)]
*  He's carrying a SAW, squad automatic weapon, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6863.5s)]
*  belt-fed machine gun. [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6865.66s)]
*  And he fell out. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6866.780000000001s)]
*  And he fell so hard, he actually bent. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6868.06s)]
*  We had the gun, it bent the barrel. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6869.62s)]
*  So he's without a gun now on the mountain. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6871.74s)]
*  The helicopter takes off without realizing he fell out. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6874.18s)]
*  So now Neil's by himself with Al Qaeda. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6876.66s)]
*  And they did him dirty. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6878.22s)]
*  He fought for a while, but he ended up getting, [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6880.0599999999995s)]
*  killed pretty bad. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6883.3s)]
*  And then they came back in to get him. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6884.5s)]
*  And that's when, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6885.78s)]
*  Brits Levinsky and Chappie was John Chapman, [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6888.0599999999995s)]
*  CCT guy, who they were both awarded Medals of Honor. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6892.46s)]
*  John Chapman should have been awarded two Medals of Honor [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6894.82s)]
*  for what he did on the mountain. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6896.3s)]
*  He actually ended up, [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6897.54s)]
*  they ended up fighting it out close quarters, [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6898.38s)]
*  like inside bunkers with each other. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6900.46s)]
*  They found Neil. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6902.18s)]
*  They ended up, they left John Chapman, [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6903.46s)]
*  Rangers went up and got him later. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6905.66s)]
*  Really shitty fight, [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6907.22s)]
*  but Neil was the first casualty [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6908.06s)]
*  that everybody knew and loved. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6910.06s)]
*  Like he, like his, his old course time, [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6912.14s)]
*  he was the fastest obstacle course runner at Buzz, [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6914.78s)]
*  is on his headstone. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6916.66s)]
*  So he was the first one that died. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6918.7s)]
*  And that's when a lot of guys started, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6919.7s)]
*  like when we started training after that fight, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6921.38s)]
*  everything that we'd been trained on, change it. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6925.06s)]
*  Because you're not going to do that stupid shit. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6928.5s)]
*  You're not going to stand up, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6929.34s)]
*  pirouette and say center appeal. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6930.16s)]
*  You're going to get the fuck down [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6931.34s)]
*  because these bullets are coming right here. [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6932.94s)]
*  So change everything. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6934.74s)]
*  Now we're going back and we're fighting in the mountains [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6936.26s)]
*  with guys who've been fighting their whole lives. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6937.86s)]
*  To the point where like, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6939.82s)]
*  I remember fighting guys where, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6940.66s)]
*  saying to my guys, as we're getting ambushed, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6942.94s)]
*  this is going to end one of two ways. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6945.3s)]
*  We're going to die or we're going to win. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6946.5s)]
*  That's it. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6948.18s)]
*  And save one bullet for yourself. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6949.02s)]
*  Cause you do not want to get captured by these guys. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6950.34s)]
*  So it's, it's, it's very intense. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6952.74s)]
*  I mean, I'm, I'm in one fight I was in, [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6954.1s)]
*  I ran into a guy that looked like me, red hair, red beard, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6955.9s)]
*  shooting a belt fed machine gun at me, yelling, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6959.379999999999s)]
*  Allah Akbar. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6961.58s)]
*  And that realization is, okay, that's a Chechen. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6962.94s)]
*  And those dudes are very serious. [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6966.42s)]
*  That's Al Qaeda, like a hundred percent Al Qaeda. [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6968.099999999999s)]
*  And you, you, you're going to have to kill him [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6970.46s)]
*  or kill yourself because it's on. [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6973.5s)]
*  And yeah, that, I mean, I was on a border bombing. [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6976.0599999999995s)]
*  Did you kill him? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6978.78s)]
*  Yeah. With the air force. [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6979.62s)]
*  We ended up getting, we got ambushed for a full hour. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6981.58s)]
*  I'd actually, I'd heard about from Vietnam guys, [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6985.7s)]
*  they used to wear their, we used to wear a gear in lines, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6990.78s)]
*  like third line, first line, second line, third line. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6992.74s)]
*  First line gear is on your body. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6995.3s)]
*  It's the most important shit you have. [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6996.78s)]
*  So it's on your belt in your pockets. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=6997.86s)]
*  So your second line is your second most important. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7000.099999999999s)]
*  So like bullets, grenades and water. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7001.78s)]
*  Third line is your least important stuff in a backpack, [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7003.74s)]
*  like foot powder, extra socks, sleeping bag. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7005.82s)]
*  The reason you carry it that way is so if you're running [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7007.98s)]
*  for your life, you can start getting rid of it. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7009.98s)]
*  Third line for a second line, you can sprint. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7011.5s)]
*  And I never heard of anyone doing it, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7013.74s)]
*  but I dropped it and had to go to my radio guy [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7015.42s)]
*  because we're getting ambushed on this mountain. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7017.54s)]
*  It was just a horrible day. [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7019.06s)]
*  And I told them to call, you know, we got to, [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7021.06s)]
*  I can see this checkpoint up top where the leadership is. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7023.14s)]
*  I went bomb them first and they said, well, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7025.54s)]
*  we don't have any air, there's no air support. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7027.5s)]
*  We got nothing. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7029.58s)]
*  So we had to lay there and take fire [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7030.9s)]
*  as they're surrounding us. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7032.18s)]
*  And they got close. [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7033.18s)]
*  I mean, tracers flying in between my hand and my face, [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7034.26s)]
*  like in between two tracers is five real bullets. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7038.34s)]
*  Zip it. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7041.14s)]
*  Where you're almost thinking like, [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7042.26s)]
*  now is it going to hurt when I get shot in the face? [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7044.38s)]
*  Or do you feel it? [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7046.46s)]
*  Or do you go to heaven? [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7047.860000000001s)]
*  What happens when you like that's like air burst [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7048.7s)]
*  RPGs and stuff going off. [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7050.58s)]
*  And finally he'd snap me out of it by saying, I got one. [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7052.22s)]
*  I got a jet. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7054.14s)]
*  And I said, cool, hit that checkpoint. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7054.9800000000005s)]
*  He said, I can't because the batteries just died. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7056.34s)]
*  And I'm a big believer in not micromanaging. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7059.1s)]
*  And I said, change the batteries. [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7061.42s)]
*  He said, I can't, I'm not carrying the spares. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7063.02s)]
*  Remember you are. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7065.06s)]
*  I'm like, oh shit, it's in the backpack. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7067.06s)]
*  I dropped a hundred meters that way. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7068.3s)]
*  Now I got to run and get that damn thing [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7070.38s)]
*  as they're shooting at me here. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7072.1s)]
*  Got the batteries and threw them to him. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7073.54s)]
*  And he called in a, I think it was a B1. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7074.9800000000005s)]
*  Cause he said bombs away two minutes out. [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7077.860000000001s)]
*  And like two minutes out, what did space shuttle drop? [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7079.5s)]
*  These things, we need them on us. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7081.22s)]
*  And then you just hear him sizzling and like baking. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7082.46s)]
*  And then we just start bombing the side of this mountain [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7084.14s)]
*  and they start running back into Pakistan. [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7086.18s)]
*  We pursued him into Pakistan and bombed them [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7088.3s)]
*  for three hours because we could. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7090.18s)]
*  We had positive identification troops in contact [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7093.14s)]
*  so we can bomb them. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7094.9400000000005s)]
*  But then we get back and Pakistan, [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7096.14s)]
*  we killed 11 Pakistani soldiers [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7098.58s)]
*  and I don't know how many Al Qaeda. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7100.06s)]
*  And they started saying an unprovoked ambush, [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7101.7s)]
*  Americans started bombing Pakistan. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7103.66s)]
*  So the boss I talked to said, well, here's the deal. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7105.46s)]
*  Cause I was the ground force commander for that. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7108.26s)]
*  And he goes, well, you're either gonna get a silver star [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7109.42s)]
*  or you're going to Leavenworth. [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7112.38s)]
*  So we'll let you know. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7113.3s)]
*  It's like, when? [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7114.7s)]
*  Like I have to wait three weeks to find out [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7116.0199999999995s)]
*  if I'm going to jail now. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7117.54s)]
*  But yeah. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7119.26s)]
*  Did you get the silver star? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7120.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that was my first. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7120.92s)]
*  I got two. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7122.0599999999995s)]
*  But I mean, again, but those, it's not, [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7126.46s)]
*  it's almost like I'd give the silver star back [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7129.0199999999995s)]
*  to not have that memory. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7130.54s)]
*  I bet. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7132.26s)]
*  So when you're tormented by what we refer to as PTSD, [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7133.1s)]
*  like what are you thinking? [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7139.54s)]
*  I wouldn't say tormented. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7140.78s)]
*  It's just more, it's just the awareness and the, [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7141.82s)]
*  just thinking thoughts that I don't need to be thinking. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7146.42s)]
*  Just knowing what, if someone got to someone I loved, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7149.06s)]
*  what they would do. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7154.7s)]
*  And I don't like thinking about that. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7156.02s)]
*  So it almost, again, not tormented, more of a protector, [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7157.94s)]
*  like an over protector. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7161.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7162.42s)]
*  And just make sure everyone has guns. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7163.26s)]
*  So that's a lot to go through in your 40s. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7166.54s)]
*  Well, and to consider like, I just joined to get out of town. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7170.5s)]
*  It's like that poster of the dude chucking a grenade [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7174.14s)]
*  and says, I just joined for the college money. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7176.900000000001s)]
*  So given everything you've just told us [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7180.1s)]
*  for the last two hours, how do you feel [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7182.6s)]
*  when you're driving in your car or looking at your phone [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7185.06s)]
*  and you see some political figure saying, [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7187.54s)]
*  hey, let's have a war with country X? [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7189.38s)]
*  Well, a good indicator is if anyone's referred [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7191.66s)]
*  to as a war hawk, they've never been to war. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7194.26s)]
*  And they just love the idea [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7198.18s)]
*  of the military industrial complex. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7199.42s)]
*  They're gonna get paid. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7203.22s)]
*  Their friends are gonna get paid. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7204.66s)]
*  They have no skin in the game. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7205.7s)]
*  And they've never been up close when, [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7208.7s)]
*  I mean, getting bombed in a house you're in [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7211.42s)]
*  has gotta be the worst thing ever, [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7213.54s)]
*  buried alive in that heat. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7214.62s)]
*  And they just love doing that because, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7216.66s)]
*  we'll get a contract to build more bombs. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7218.54s)]
*  And just the threat, I mean, as long as I've been alive, [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7221.259999999999s)]
*  there's either been war or a threat of war. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7224.0199999999995s)]
*  And if you keep people afraid, [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7226.139999999999s)]
*  we'll slowly give up our liberty. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7227.139999999999s)]
*  The Patriot Act sounded great on 9-12, [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7229.259999999999s)]
*  but the week later it's like, wait, what are you watching? [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7230.94s)]
*  Why are you watching us now? [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7233.099999999999s)]
*  Did you guys ever talk about that? [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7234.78s)]
*  No, it did, no, because it was red, white, and blue [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7236.139999999999s)]
*  and apple pie, like we're Americans [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7238.259999999999s)]
*  and we're the good guys. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7239.78s)]
*  When you were in the service, like the whole time, [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7240.66s)]
*  you never. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7242.259999999999s)]
*  Nope, I didn't question Iraq. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7243.099999999999s)]
*  It's like, I wanted to go. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7244.66s)]
*  Get me in there before this ends. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7246.54s)]
*  When did you start rethinking? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7248.58s)]
*  About seven years ago. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7251.78s)]
*  You're the most famous trigger puller in the war on terror. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7252.62s)]
*  I think that's fair to say. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7257.62s)]
*  So, and a lot of positive reinforcement [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7259.66s)]
*  because people are impressed by your bravery [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7262.42s)]
*  and amazed by all the things that you saw [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7263.98s)]
*  and you are kind of the Forrest Gump of the war on terror. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7265.7s)]
*  I think that's true. [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7267.54s)]
*  But at what point did you start to question, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7269.46s)]
*  like, what was that? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7272.3s)]
*  Yeah, seven years. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7273.34s)]
*  No, after Iraq, after we started to pull out [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7275.3s)]
*  and ISIS was formed, it was like, [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7277.820000000001s)]
*  at first for me, it was more of a, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7280.1s)]
*  we never should have invaded, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7281.54s)]
*  but we also shouldn't have left, like that. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7282.740000000001s)]
*  And then you got that convoy of ISIS coming in from to create, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7285.3s)]
*  it's like, bomb them, we have ATMs, that's ISIS, [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7290.26s)]
*  kill them all, but they didn't. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7293.34s)]
*  And then ISIS turned into ISIS [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7294.780000000001s)]
*  and it's all part of the Islamic Jihad. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7296.02s)]
*  It's all the ISIS, even though they're different sects, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7298.580000000001s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, and all those, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7301.3s)]
*  everyone down to the Houthis. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7302.5s)]
*  It's all, but then they're fighting us [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7303.66s)]
*  because we're there. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7307.139999999999s)]
*  Guys were leaving countries like Jordan and Syria [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7309.34s)]
*  to go to Iraq because, well, we can fight Americans [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7312.0199999999995s)]
*  and I got nothing else going on. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7313.94s)]
*  Just, it's easier to kill them there [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7315.78s)]
*  than it is to get to Afghanistan. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7317.7s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7318.9s)]
*  And so we're just fighting the fight. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7319.74s)]
*  You know, we forgot about WNB, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7321.86s)]
*  but a couple of months into it, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7323.3s)]
*  and then it turns into a surge [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7325.0599999999995s)]
*  and it turns into, well, we got to kill ISIS, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7327.34s)]
*  well, we got to kill Zarqawi. [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7329.74s)]
*  Well, we got to kill, you know, [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7330.86s)]
*  first it's Hussein, Uday and Kusay, [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7332.14s)]
*  and then it's Zarqawi, and then it's now it's ISIS, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7333.660000000001s)]
*  and then it's Baghdadi, and then you got [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7336.22s)]
*  Qaisem Soleimani from Iran, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7338.900000000001s)]
*  and then you got the Iranian influence everywhere [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7340.14s)]
*  in Afghanistan, you know, they're all in Pakistan. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7342.06s)]
*  Al Qaeda's working with Iran, the Sunni and the Shia [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7344.1s)]
*  are all together. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7346.06s)]
*  It's like, it's, you know, it's a mess. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7346.900000000001s)]
*  And well, I mean, hopefully now it's going to get better. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7349.740000000001s)]
*  I mean. [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7352.740000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's always, you know, [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7353.58s)]
*  that's always the hope, we're commanded to hope. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7354.42s)]
*  If the bombs in Iran worked, great. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7355.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, you know, Iran's one of those things [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7359.58s)]
*  where I don't want them to get a nuclear weapon for sure. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7361.38s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7363.74s)]
*  But then I was also saying, if you're going to bomb them, [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7364.58s)]
*  you better be all in and be right. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7366.82s)]
*  This intel cannot be wrong. [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7369.46s)]
*  And they hit them and it's like, well, I mean, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7371.42s)]
*  and again, I wasn't necessarily, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7372.78s)]
*  I definitely didn't want to land war in Iran, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7374.9400000000005s)]
*  but if you're going to, now that you hit them, [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7376.900000000001s)]
*  now I'm a hundred percent in with you. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7380.58s)]
*  Cause it doesn't matter why we're here, we are, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7382.18s)]
*  did it work? [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7383.54s)]
*  Cause you're betting a lot on that. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7385.5s)]
*  And if you, I don't want troops on the ground there. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7386.74s)]
*  What would that look like? [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7389.86s)]
*  Well, I mean, it will look like everything we go in, [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7391.82s)]
*  we kick someone's ass, but then we decide a nation build [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7393.38s)]
*  and that's where they get us. [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7395.94s)]
*  No one's going to mess with us. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7396.78s)]
*  But our like, the Marine Corps is not there to build schools. [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7398.86s)]
*  Marine Corps is going to break stuff, kill people. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7401.74s)]
*  And then the way we handle Iran is great. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7403.0599999999995s)]
*  Punch them in the face and tell them no, and then leave. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7406.299999999999s)]
*  And that's, or destroy the whole country. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7410.139999999999s)]
*  That's it. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7412.259999999999s)]
*  But this whole nation building, we've proven, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7413.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, it didn't work in Vietnam. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7415.34s)]
*  We're still, we're still in a conflict with Korea. [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7417.0199999999995s)]
*  What happened in Grenada? [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7420.5s)]
*  What happened in Panama? [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7421.34s)]
*  What are we doing? [[02:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7422.18s)]
*  The first time Gulf War, second Gulf War, Afghanistan, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7423.0199999999995s)]
*  we got Bin Laden, but he was in Pakistan. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7424.34s)]
*  You know, why are we giving money to Pakistan? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7426.98s)]
*  If they're harboring terrorists, you know, [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7429.46s)]
*  it's very complex. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7431.74s)]
*  Why are we doing that? [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7432.7s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7433.54s)]
*  I don't know why we give Egypt all that money. [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7434.38s)]
*  They built a wall, they won't let any Palestinians in. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7436.94s)]
*  Well, we're doing it at the request of another, [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7438.86s)]
*  I mean, we're not doing it for Egypt, right? [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7440.66s)]
*  We've been asked to do that, of course. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7442.98s)]
*  But like, why do you think we went into Iraq [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7446.18s)]
*  where you almost got killed? [[02:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7449.9800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I think because Saddam Hussein said [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7451.18s)]
*  he was going to assassinate George H.W. Bush [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7455.54s)]
*  and George W. Bush, you know, loves his dad [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7457.62s)]
*  and never let that go. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7459.700000000001s)]
*  And I had friends that were flag officers in the Pentagon [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7461.5s)]
*  a week after 9-11 and they were already planning [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7464.900000000001s)]
*  the invasion of Iraq. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7466.700000000001s)]
*  And some of these officers like, why? [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7467.9400000000005s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7469.780000000001s)]
*  They had nothing to do with this. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7470.62s)]
*  Why are we gonna invade Iraq? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7472.1s)]
*  And that, and we shifted all of our assets to Iraq [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7472.9400000000005s)]
*  instead of Afghanistan when we should have been [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7475.5s)]
*  fighting al-Qaeda here, find bin Laden, kill him, [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7477.22s)]
*  and then hopefully that's it. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7478.94s)]
*  But now we're in Iraq, bogged down. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7480.42s)]
*  And I mean, even taking down Baghdad, [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7483.22s)]
*  it's like, what are you gonna do next? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7485.54s)]
*  Well, they'll rise up and then they'll start [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7488.62s)]
*  their own government and we were saying, [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7491.5s)]
*  well, what if they don't? [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7492.9s)]
*  Well, they will, but yeah, but they might not. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7494.1s)]
*  What if they don't? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7495.26s)]
*  Yeah, but they will, no, they won't. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7496.1s)]
*  And then they didn't and it's chaos. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7497.74s)]
*  Oh, they didn't? [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7499.34s)]
*  No. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7500.18s)]
*  They're in the robbing the museums. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7501.98s)]
*  But it's almost one of those things too, [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7504.82s)]
*  like the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7506.259999999999s)]
*  These people have been under a dictator [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7510.58s)]
*  and maybe they need a softer dictator [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7512.179999999999s)]
*  because they're not ready for democracy. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7514.259999999999s)]
*  And even in Afghanistan, you think the people [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7516.139999999999s)]
*  in the Shari'a Valley want our style of democracy? [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7518.38s)]
*  I've talked to farmers, I've eaten rice [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7521.139999999999s)]
*  out of the same bowls, these guys, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7523.0199999999995s)]
*  and had a probably Taliban guy saying, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7524.66s)]
*  why would I send my son to school [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7526.46s)]
*  when I can teach him how to farm? [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7528.54s)]
*  He doesn't need to sit in a school. [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7529.98s)]
*  Why would you build this one? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7531.42s)]
*  We don't want that shit. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7532.259999999999s)]
*  Because it's different. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7534.74s)]
*  And we don't do any research. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7535.58s)]
*  We don't know the history of places. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7537.5s)]
*  We just think, yeah, we'll go over there. [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7539.42s)]
*  They love USA. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7540.7s)]
*  I'd love to break it to a lot of the politicians. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7542.3s)]
*  Most people don't like the United States [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7543.86s)]
*  and especially in that part of the world. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7545.86s)]
*  Wait, there was no research done? [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7547.62s)]
*  No, there were officers that thought Iraq [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7550.099999999999s)]
*  and Afghanistan were the same. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7554.46s)]
*  Officers thought that? [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7556.42s)]
*  Oh yeah, what's the difference? [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7557.34s)]
*  We're going to one or the other. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7558.58s)]
*  It's like, there's a huge difference. [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7559.42s)]
*  If you run into a dude from Saudi Arabia in Afghanistan, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7562.3s)]
*  he's a foreigner to them too. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7564.9800000000005s)]
*  Big time. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7566.34s)]
*  He's a foreign fighter. [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7567.18s)]
*  He looks nothing like them, by the way. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7568.02s)]
*  I ran into one dude and I think the only reason [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7569.06s)]
*  I didn't shoot him is because he made me laugh. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7571.34s)]
*  He didn't speak English, but his teacher said, [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7573.06s)]
*  I'm not kidding, it said, it's not a beer belly, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7575.74s)]
*  it's a fuel tank for a sex machine. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7578.86s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't know what it said, [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7583.3s)]
*  but I thought it was true. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7584.74s)]
*  Where was this? [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7585.58s)]
*  That was in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7586.42s)]
*  One of my first missions in Afghanistan, [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7587.24s)]
*  in a house in the city. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7589.02s)]
*  He had no idea what it said. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7591.46s)]
*  No idea what it said, it was awesome. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7592.3s)]
*  Give him a quick gut punch and tell him his shirt's funny. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7593.9800000000005s)]
*  So, but you think there were, you know that there were [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7596.14s)]
*  officers who thought Iraq and Afghanistan [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7600.18s)]
*  were basically the same? [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7602.3s)]
*  I had an officer, I told you about the L ambush. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7603.14s)]
*  When we were selling, you had to sell your mission. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7605.62s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7607.14s)]
*  Here's who's there, blah, blah, blah. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7607.9800000000005s)]
*  I was selling this to him and I said, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7609.14s)]
*  we're going to insert here and we're going to set up an L. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7610.86s)]
*  And an officer said, what's an L? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7614.14s)]
*  And I said, an L is the second thing they teach you [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7616.9400000000005s)]
*  after you join the army. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7620.26s)]
*  The first being, there's your bed, this is an L ambush. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7622.18s)]
*  And he goes, who invented it? [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7624.42s)]
*  And I'm like, Sun Tzu invented, I don't know, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7626.06s)]
*  the art of war, man, an L. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7628.18s)]
*  I'm going to hop out and stop. [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7630.38s)]
*  He's like, what if he doesn't stop? [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7631.34s)]
*  I'm going to kill him. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7632.3s)]
*  Why am I talking right now? [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7633.26s)]
*  It's an L, it's not hard. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7634.78s)]
*  And yeah, but I mean, they don't do, not all of them. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7636.54s)]
*  I've worked with great people, [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7639.7s)]
*  but there are people that are making decisions [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7640.54s)]
*  that shouldn't be making decisions. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7642.5s)]
*  Like I said yesterday, once you stop carrying your own [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7643.5s)]
*  luggage, you shouldn't be in charge of anybody. [[02:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7646.22s)]
*  You're surrounded by, and it gets political. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7648.14s)]
*  You get to that level, like a captain in the Navy [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7650.9800000000005s)]
*  or a Colonel, now they're just trying to make admiral [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7653.620000000001s)]
*  or general, so they're doing the politics. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7656.900000000001s)]
*  And if you don't do the politics, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7658.9400000000005s)]
*  you're not sticking around. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7659.900000000001s)]
*  So then you're thinking about my next star. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7661.18s)]
*  When am I going to go work for DynCorp? [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7663.620000000001s)]
*  What's my political thing going to be when I get out? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7665.26s)]
*  So it's just political shit. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7667.54s)]
*  And then the guys below them, they're just yes men. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7668.780000000001s)]
*  And they're going to tell you what you want to hear, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7671.700000000001s)]
*  not what's real. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7673.38s)]
*  They don't want to tell you the truth [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7674.58s)]
*  because you might actually know what's going on on the ground. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7675.620000000001s)]
*  Go talk to some E4 Marines. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7677.26s)]
*  They'll tell you what's happening. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7678.46s)]
*  And we're not winning this war right now [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7679.5s)]
*  because we're out there building schools [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7681.7s)]
*  or giving people a shit ton of money to embezzle. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7683.02s)]
*  And they're saying they're building a school, [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7686.38s)]
*  but they're buying a house and cutter. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7687.82s)]
*  Like you go to Afghanistan where they don't, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7689.38s)]
*  they don't know what time is. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7691.1s)]
*  They don't know how old they are, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7692.54s)]
*  but give them a briefcase full of cash [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7693.82s)]
*  and see what they do with it. [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7695.66s)]
*  The corruption, I mean, it's horrible, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7697.1s)]
*  but they don't think ahead like that [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7698.74s)]
*  because they think everyone's just like us. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7700.58s)]
*  People are different. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7702.3s)]
*  Do you think that those wars had a corrupting effect [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7703.9400000000005s)]
*  on the United States? [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7706.14s)]
*  Well, no, I mean, I think the invasion of Afghanistan [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7707.9800000000005s)]
*  was good, I think we had, I mean, [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7711.3s)]
*  but we're right back where we started. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7712.38s)]
*  Bin Laden's gone, a lot of Al Qaeda's gone, [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7714.46s)]
*  but they're going to get replaced. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7715.780000000001s)]
*  The almost 30 training camps over there, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7716.860000000001s)]
*  terror training camps in Afghanistan again. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7719.18s)]
*  God knows what's going on in Iraq. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7721.42s)]
*  I mean, that's- [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7723.02s)]
*  How does that make you feel? [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7723.860000000001s)]
*  You fought in both, you killed Bin Laden. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7724.68s)]
*  I mean- [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7726.1s)]
*  No, I mean, it's fulfilling because we were able to prove [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7727.38s)]
*  that if you're a bad guy, [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7731.9800000000005s)]
*  we have people that will come find you. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7734.38s)]
*  We proved it and we cut the head off the Al Qaeda, the snake. [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7736.26s)]
*  They know that we can do that, so it was worth it. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7738.740000000001s)]
*  We took a lot of Al Qaeda off the battlefield. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7742.3s)]
*  I think we slowed down their ability [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7744.66s)]
*  to attack this country for a while, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7746.06s)]
*  but they're getting close to coming back. [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7747.9400000000005s)]
*  You say we're hated in a lot of the world [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7751.54s)]
*  and don't know it, why are we hated? [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7753.22s)]
*  You know what, it's almost a jealousy thing [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7756.66s)]
*  because we are the most powerful country. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7758.66s)]
*  And we just proved with what we did in Iran [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7760.06s)]
*  that like we can, China and Russia are watching, [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7762.34s)]
*  like we can fly pilots over you. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7764.18s)]
*  You'll never know that they'll hit you. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7766.54s)]
*  They'll be home the next day. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7767.820000000001s)]
*  Like they'll leave from the middle of the country, [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7769.860000000001s)]
*  anywhere in the world, and you can't, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7771.34s)]
*  there's nothing you can do about it. [[02:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7774.02s)]
*  So I think a lot of them are jealous in that aspect, [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7775.740000000001s)]
*  but we're also the, we're the big dumb tough guy in the bar [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7777.740000000001s)]
*  that doesn't know he's tough until he has to be. [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7780.46s)]
*  So I mean, in the Middle East, just because we're there [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7783.900000000001s)]
*  and like forward defense, [[02:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7786.22s)]
*  I know that the world's a safer place [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7788.06s)]
*  with a strong United States. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7790.18s)]
*  And the forward defense and alliance solidarity is great. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7792.5s)]
*  The carriers are awesome. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7794.94s)]
*  But you know, just people get sick of us. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7796.7s)]
*  We, you know, we're still in, we're still in Germany. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7799.26s)]
*  It's only been 80 years. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7802.78s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7804.14s)]
*  What are we doing there, by the way, do you know? [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7805.22s)]
*  I mean, I've been there, it's fun. [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7806.78s)]
*  We're going to Oktoberfest, that was awesome. [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7807.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7809.34s)]
*  I don't know if it's been great for them, [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7811.1s)]
*  but did anyone ever explain, you know, [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7813.14s)]
*  you're at the highest levels. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7815.66s)]
*  They never say, you know, we're in Germany for this reason, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7816.94s)]
*  we're Japan for this reason. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7818.82s)]
*  No, we just had a unit there. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7819.66s)]
*  And we can forward stage out of there. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7820.82s)]
*  So we can be somewhere like Bosnia quicker. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7822.74s)]
*  We can fly to, you know, we stop in Ramstein [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7825.38s)]
*  on our way to Iraq and Afghanistan. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7828.54s)]
*  So we can get there quicker. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7829.82s)]
*  We got Air Force bases over there too. [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7830.66s)]
*  I mean, we have a great relationship with the Germans. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7832.0199999999995s)]
*  You must, you deal with a lot of, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7835.7s)]
*  you've met a lot of politicians. [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7836.98s)]
*  I know that. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7838.219999999999s)]
*  You worked at Fox for a while, always politicians there. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7839.0599999999995s)]
*  Did anybody ever apologize to you? [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7842.139999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7844.0199999999995s)]
*  There's nothing, no. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7845.3s)]
*  I don't know if there's anything. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7846.139999999999s)]
*  What do you mean? [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7847.62s)]
*  They sent you, I mean, [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7848.46s)]
*  you sign up for the seals, [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7851.62s)]
*  you know you're gonna risk your life. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7852.46s)]
*  That's on you. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7853.3s)]
*  I think that's fair. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7854.139999999999s)]
*  But what's on politicians and policymakers [[02:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7855.099999999999s)]
*  is to only ask you to risk your life for really good reason. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7858.34s)]
*  I think that's fair too. [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7862.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7863.0199999999995s)]
*  No, no one really has said anything. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7863.86s)]
*  George Bush wrote me a handwritten letter, which was cool. [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7864.679999999999s)]
*  Just thanking me for it. [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7868.3s)]
*  Cause I said that that quote, [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7869.38s)]
*  freedom itself was attacked this morning. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7872.34s)]
*  So he thanked me for remembering his words. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7873.94s)]
*  That was cool. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7875.3s)]
*  And I don't think an apology is necessary [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7877.3s)]
*  because at the time I wanted it more than anything. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7878.7s)]
*  I mean, seriously, but 9-11 happened, [[02:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7881.86s)]
*  let's invade everybody. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7883.82s)]
*  I'm ready. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7884.88s)]
*  Let's go fight. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7885.72s)]
*  Well, everyone felt that way. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7886.54s)]
*  Just, I mean, again, as time goes on, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7887.38s)]
*  maybe there's a lot of them are thinking, [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7889.62s)]
*  well, we did make a bad decision. [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7891.22s)]
*  But at the time everyone was ramped up. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7893.26s)]
*  You had Democrats voting for war. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7894.82s)]
*  Oh, they love war now though. [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7896.0599999999995s)]
*  So I don't know why you said that. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7897.78s)]
*  All but one, Barbara Lee of Berkeley. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7898.62s)]
*  So, I mean, you live still in a world [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7900.7s)]
*  surrounded by people who had jobs similar to yours. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7903.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7906.26s)]
*  Are they rethinking their views [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7908.1s)]
*  or rethinking what they went through [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7910.42s)]
*  and what it meant or? [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7911.700000000001s)]
*  They're rethinking their lifestyles. [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7913.46s)]
*  Like I was always impressed [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7917.700000000001s)]
*  when some of my friends told me they quit drinking. [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7919.06s)]
*  They left out the part that it was because they did Ibogaine. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7921.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7924.22s)]
*  I said, oh, you quit drinking. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7925.06s)]
*  That's great. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7925.88s)]
*  Well, I did Ibogaine. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7926.72s)]
*  And so they're rethinking their lifestyles [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7927.56s)]
*  and getting into more healthy stuff. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7929.22s)]
*  But I haven't heard a lot of my friends talk about Iraq [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7932.02s)]
*  the way I talk about Iraq. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7934.860000000001s)]
*  They don't, I'm not sure if, [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7936.74s)]
*  I mean, we went in there just because there was a vendetta. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7940.22s)]
*  There was nothing tactical about that. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7943.0599999999995s)]
*  Does it make you wonder, [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7946.18s)]
*  like there are all these theories about Bin Laden, [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7947.7s)]
*  who he was really working for. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7950.58s)]
*  Was he behind, actually behind 9-11? [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7952.0199999999995s)]
*  Was that really him who you shot? [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7954.54s)]
*  Do people ever say that to you? [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7958.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7959.94s)]
*  I had someone tell me it was a body double that I shot. [[02:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7960.78s)]
*  And my response is, well, [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7963.34s)]
*  I killed the guy that was in bed with Bin Laden's wife. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7965.18s)]
*  So either way, he had it coming. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7967.14s)]
*  But it was, oh, 100% him. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7969.14s)]
*  That was definitely him. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7970.26s)]
*  Even meeting the CIA people before we went, [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7973.1s)]
*  I was convinced because of the, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7975.700000000001s)]
*  especially that one woman that was, it's him. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7976.900000000001s)]
*  Definitely him. [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7978.820000000001s)]
*  All the stuff we found, he was definitely still running Al Qaeda. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7979.66s)]
*  But how the hell did he live in Pakistan for 10 years? [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7981.820000000001s)]
*  Had to be with the ISI, the Intel service. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7984.26s)]
*  Had to be monitoring. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7986.18s)]
*  Because I think they have vested interests [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7988.26s)]
*  in keeping Al Qaeda a little bit out Bay, [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7989.62s)]
*  which is good for everyone. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7992.5s)]
*  Because you don't want Al Qaeda [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7993.46s)]
*  getting their nuclear weapons. [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7994.7s)]
*  But they're a massive recipient of US aid. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7997.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=7999.42s)]
*  But they're basically our enemy? [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8000.54s)]
*  Well, I mean, we were funding the Mujahedeen in the 80s [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8002.18s)]
*  and Bin Laden was a part of that. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8005.74s)]
*  Because the big enemy was the Soviet Union. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8007.7s)]
*  So let's fight them in Afghanistan [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8009.7s)]
*  and start pumping money in there through Pakistan. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8010.78s)]
*  So they've been involved forever. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8012.54s)]
*  What was the role of opium in all this, in Afghanistan? [[02:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8015.78s)]
*  That was kind of dumb because all we're doing, [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8018.5s)]
*  I mean, heroin's bad, [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8021.78s)]
*  but you're taking away someone's livelihood. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8023.82s)]
*  So what are they gonna do if they can't grow opium? [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8026.66s)]
*  They're gonna fight you. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8028.179999999999s)]
*  They're gonna be Taliban. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8029.5s)]
*  Why do you care? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8030.86s)]
*  Stop worrying about the opium, let them grow it, who cares? [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8032.34s)]
*  But that became a major thorn in our side [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8034.98s)]
*  because we're worried about opium. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8037.26s)]
*  How about we just kill the Taliban in Al Qaeda? [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8038.62s)]
*  Who cares? [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8041.099999999999s)]
*  What about female literacy? [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8041.98s)]
*  Was that a good reason to go to war? [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8043.179999999999s)]
*  No, for war, no, that's more, I don't think, that's for- [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8044.62s)]
*  Just joking. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8048.42s)]
*  Well, I'm just saying- [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8049.26s)]
*  You'd always hear people say, [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8050.099999999999s)]
*  literacy rates got up and it's like, okay. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8051.08s)]
*  No, that's on them. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8053.0s)]
*  Take care of your own house. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8055.04s)]
*  If your women can't read, [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8056.64s)]
*  I'm not coming to shoot people over that. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8057.4800000000005s)]
*  So you never thought of that [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8060.4400000000005s)]
*  as you broke into someone's house? [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8061.36s)]
*  No. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8062.76s)]
*  Your girls can't read! [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8063.6s)]
*  It's almost like when we want women to vote, [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8064.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm like, why? [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8065.92s)]
*  I'm joking. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8069.76s)]
*  Sort of. [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8071.16s)]
*  I'm half joking. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8072.0s)]
*  I'm not, but, sorry. [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8072.82s)]
*  Did you ever talk politics? [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8077.84s)]
*  Not really, [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8080.0s)]
*  because I remember I would read political books [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8080.84s)]
*  before 9-11, especially on the ships. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8083.64s)]
*  I remember reading Sean Hannity's books [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8086.68s)]
*  and I read Alan Combs' book, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8088.88s)]
*  just to try to get both sides. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8092.2s)]
*  That's kind of where I got my politics. [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8093.6s)]
*  Well, this is crazy, that makes sense. [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8095.4800000000005s)]
*  But no one was really interested in that with me. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8097.88s)]
*  I couldn't get anyone to play chess either. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8099.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've always been political, [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8102.84s)]
*  not political, but trying to pay attention. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8104.64s)]
*  And I honestly believe the media [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8107.12s)]
*  has been telling us the truth for a while, [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8108.44s)]
*  until again, COVID or whatever. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8110.48s)]
*  Yeah, you don't believe that anymore? [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8112.639999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8114.28s)]
*  No, that was a scam. [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8115.5599999999995s)]
*  So last question on a happy note. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8116.719999999999s)]
*  So you basically made the case without saying it [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8119.759999999999s)]
*  that a lot of the flag officers, [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8121.919999999999s)]
*  senior military leadership, not impressive. [[02:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8123.36s)]
*  And that's very obvious to me. [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8126.4s)]
*  Who is the most impressive senior officer you've known? [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8129.36s)]
*  Bill McRaven. [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8132.679999999999s)]
*  Wow, that didn't take long. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8133.599999999999s)]
*  He always has been. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8135.16s)]
*  I knew him. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8136.04s)]
*  Can you tell people who he is? [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8136.88s)]
*  Admiral McRaven was in charge [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8138.64s)]
*  of Joint Special Operations Command [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8139.84s)]
*  when we took the bin Laden raid. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8141.84s)]
*  He's the one that sold it to President Obama. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8143.12s)]
*  He's a SEAL Team Six guy. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8146.52s)]
*  And he just, he'd always, I think he was an admiral [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8148.64s)]
*  the whole time I was in the military. [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8151.68s)]
*  But every time he showed up, [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8153.6s)]
*  he looked and sounded like an officer. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8155.32s)]
*  And the way I described, he looked like a SEAL, [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8158.28s)]
*  he sounds like a SEAL, he's really sharp. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8160.12s)]
*  And I shouldn't bad mouth all flag officers [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8164.24s)]
*  because he's included, he's just a bad ass. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8165.8s)]
*  He knew it really good at everything. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8167.56s)]
*  And the way I would describe it is like, [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8168.84s)]
*  I understand why Al Qaeda was afraid [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8170.76s)]
*  because like 23 Bill McRavens just came in your house [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8172.280000000001s)]
*  at night to get you and that's scary. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8174.4400000000005s)]
*  So, but just, he was just sharp, sharp as a tack. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8176.52s)]
*  And he- [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8179.76s)]
*  Honest? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8180.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, yeah. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8181.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean, yeah, he's the guy. [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8182.280000000001s)]
*  It's like, it doesn't take, [[02:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8183.72s)]
*  it didn't take me a second to answer that question. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8186.320000000001s)]
*  How did he get to that? [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8188.52s)]
*  How did he become an admiral? [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8190.360000000001s)]
*  I don't even know how that works. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8192.0s)]
*  I, you know, obviously got to take command [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8193.88s)]
*  of different places. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8195.56s)]
*  So, you know, run a platoon at a SEAL team, run operations. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8196.4s)]
*  Yeah, you get promoted to an executive officer [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8199.64s)]
*  then a commanding officer, which is an O5 level. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8201.8s)]
*  Have a command move up to like the group level. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8203.96s)]
*  So you got like a couple of different groups [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8205.72s)]
*  and like dev group being one of them, SEAL team six, [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8207.48s)]
*  commander there and then just start getting stars. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8209.72s)]
*  So he was the second four star admiral ever. [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8213.679999999998s)]
*  I think Admiral Olson was the first one, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8216.8s)]
*  great officer too. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8218.359999999999s)]
*  We were, I was fortunate, my SEAL officers were [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8220.199999999999s)]
*  for the most part really good. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8223.2s)]
*  Like Jaco, he was one of my guys. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8225.24s)]
*  No, I was one of his guys. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8227.76s)]
*  And he was a dude that I learned, [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8229.44s)]
*  what I learned from him is I've never seen him lose control [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8230.76s)]
*  or yell, but what he was really good at when you screw up [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8233.88s)]
*  is man, I expected so much more out of you. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8237.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8240.76s)]
*  I'm never going to let you down again. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8242.0s)]
*  But he was incredible. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8243.48s)]
*  He re-enlisted me in Kuwait and then yeah, [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8244.6s)]
*  I've worked with some, I've been fortunate [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8246.84s)]
*  to work with really good officers. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8248.0s)]
*  But McCraven best. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8249.119999999999s)]
*  Yeah, by far. [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8250.0s)]
*  Rob, thank you. [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8252.16s)]
*  Of course, thank you for having me, Tiger. [[02:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8253.0s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8254.119999999999s)]
*  It's been fun. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8254.96s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8255.8s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8262.52s)]
*  That's what they do. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8264.08s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8264.92s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8266.56s)]
*  all the change taking place in our economy [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8268.48s)]
*  and our politics with the wars, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8271.119999999999s)]
*  one the cusp of fighting right now, [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8272.92s)]
*  Google has decided you should have less information [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8275.08s)]
*  rather than more. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8278.08s)]
*  And that is totally wrong. [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8279.6s)]
*  It's immoral. [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8281.6s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8282.96s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8284.52s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8285.92s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[02:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8287.119999999999s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8288.119999999999s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8289.439999999999s)]
*  that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8291.6s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8294.439999999999s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8296.48s)]
*  Subscribe. [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8298.0s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8298.84s)]
*  when we upload and share this video. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8301.0s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8303.359999999999s)]
*  of hearing actual news and information. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8305.56s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3z_kpaLmFo&t=8308.52s)]
