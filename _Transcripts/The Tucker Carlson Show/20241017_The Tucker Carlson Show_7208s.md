# Miranda Devine Joe Biden’s Secret Contempt for Kamala, and Whether Hunter Will Ever Face Justice
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [October 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o)
*  So we saw Zelensky campaigning for Kamala Harris, the unelected president, I guess that'd [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=0.0s)]
*  be dictator of Ukraine campaigning for Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania a couple of weeks ago. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=28.96s)]
*  And it just is a reminder that Ukraine is not just like a foreign policy priority, it [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=35.96s)]
*  is central to this administration and has been for 10 years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  You've reported on this more than anybody. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=49.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=50.72s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's the central question and the kind of mystery about Joe Biden. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=51.72s)]
*  And it's the key to figuring out how he got to be president. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=56.8s)]
*  This very unprepossessing, not very intelligent man was sort of captured, I think, in his [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  very earliest days in the Senate. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=66.84s)]
*  He came to the Senate as a green 30-year-old kind of part-time grifter from Delaware. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=68.74s)]
*  And he was immediately embraced by the sort of elder statesmen who are controlled, the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=74.88s)]
*  establishment basically in the Senate and was elevated to the most powerful committee [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=81.84s)]
*  in the Senate, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he ended up being chairman [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=87.8s)]
*  or ranking member for over a decade. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=91.98s)]
*  And that is the place where the CIA meets government power. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  He had access to the CIA, CIA had access to him, and he was very early on captured by [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  the Chinese or captivated by the Chinese. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=108.16s)]
*  He traveled as a young senator to the Chinese equivalent of Martha's Vineyard and met all [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=110.76s)]
*  the top CCP people, came back waxing lyrical about how wonderful China was, just like Tim [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  Walls, same sort of capture. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=123.04s)]
*  And so much so that the weekly standard at the time ran a cover story just saying how [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  ridiculous he was. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=130.28s)]
*  And the same with Russia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=133.16s)]
*  The foreign policy establishment in America has this obsession with Russia and wanting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=135.12s)]
*  now regime change with Putin, enlarging NATO. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=143.12s)]
*  That was, people don't really realize, but Joe Biden was pushing for the enlargement [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=147.08s)]
*  of NATO to include especially Ukraine and Georgia. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=151.72s)]
*  So yeah, Victoria Nuland and Joe Biden are probably the two most instrumental Americans [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  Ukraine policy for, you know, since before the Maidan revolution in 2014. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=161.68s)]
*  Victoria Nuland was over there. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  There's this ridiculous scene that was captured on videotape of her sort of striding around [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=170.56s)]
*  Maidan Square, handing out sandwiches from a big bag to the protesters there and saying, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=177.04000000000002s)]
*  good on you, you know, well done. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  The CIA, I mean, it's pretty much an established fact that the CIA was involved in the toppling [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  of the Yanukovych regime there, which was sort of more Russia aligned, but not as much [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=193.28s)]
*  as is said. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=198.96s)]
*  He was sort of trying to do a European trade deal. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, he was after about two months of phone calls with Joe Biden, then the vice [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=206.28s)]
*  president who would harangue him and make these grandiose threats. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=213.24s)]
*  Yanukovych finally had enough after the ninth phone call, like interminable hour long phone [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=218.6s)]
*  call with Joe Biden. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=223.72s)]
*  He just got in a helicopter and left. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=225.16s)]
*  And then Victoria Nuland is captured on a phone call that was, I think, recorded by [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=226.76s)]
*  the Russians, but released in which she and it's genuinely her. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=235.28s)]
*  And she's just talking about how they're going to impose their puppet government on [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=239.32s)]
*  Ukraine and they're going to get Joe Biden involved and he's going to give the new [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=244.76s)]
*  government an asher boy on the phone. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=249.96s)]
*  And Jake Sullivan has told them that they've got to get Joe Biden involved. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=251.96s)]
*  So these very unimpressive people, Victoria Nuland is not very impressive and neither [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=257.08s)]
*  is Joe Biden. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=263.28s)]
*  They ended up being the sort of rulers of Ukraine. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=264.32s)]
*  But what was the appeal for them? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=270.67999999999995s)]
*  Was it ideological? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=273.03999999999996s)]
*  I think for Victoria Nuland, yes, because she's a hawk, you know, neocon. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=275.4s)]
*  She was Dick Cheney's primary advisor in the Iraq War. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  I remember very well. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=285.28s)]
*  Yeah. So I think and her husband, Robert Kagan, is like a leading neocon intellectual. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=286.44s)]
*  I worked with him. One of the dumbest people I've ever worked with. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=292.48s)]
*  Really? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=295.36s)]
*  Yes. Bob Kagan and a very angry and unpleasant man, but stupid. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=296.0s)]
*  How did he become so influential then? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=301.24s)]
*  Because he's part of, you know, the Washington foreign policy establishment and, you know, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=305.20000000000005s)]
*  because of his views. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=311.72s)]
*  You know, his views are consistent. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=312.20000000000005s)]
*  Well, not like consistent. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=313.96000000000004s)]
*  They are sort of the archetype of Washington's foreign policy. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=314.96000000000004s)]
*  Very anti-American, I would say. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=319.64s)]
*  Extremely anti-American, but conventional. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=322.6s)]
*  Yeah. So I know. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=326.92s)]
*  So that's interesting, because I mean, I think I don't know about Victoria Nuland. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=327.68s)]
*  She doesn't strike me as being particularly intelligent. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=331.72s)]
*  Joe Biden certainly is not, apart from he has a sort of a cunning, political cunning. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=333.68s)]
*  But the three of them then have those establishment views, so they're useful. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=338.92s)]
*  And that's kind of my premise is that Joe Biden was the sort of tool of the blob or the people [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=344.16s)]
*  who are in control from the CIA, the State Department. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=352.44s)]
*  And they wanted a sort of puppet president, as they pretty much always had. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=356.88s)]
*  And the same people who covered up for Joe Biden and his corruption allowed at Green [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=361.56s)]
*  Littered are the same people that are propping up Kamala Harris and who regard Donald Trump as [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=366.88s)]
*  an existential threat, but not to America or democracy, like we're told, but to them and their power. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=373.6s)]
*  It's just it's amazing to me as an American, if you told me 10 years ago that I'd be sitting, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=379.88s)]
*  you know, talking to a reporter on camera about how the CIA controls who the president is [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=384.24s)]
*  and then uses the president's puppets, I would have thought that sounds a little far out. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=390.12s)]
*  But it's clearly true. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=394.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know just the CIA. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=396.92s)]
*  I mean, I think it's the Obama people called the blob, what Mike Benz talks about. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=398.48s)]
*  For sure. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=402.84000000000003s)]
*  You know, it's the Pentagon State Department CIA. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  And in the cover up of Joe Biden's corruption and Hunter Biden, the Hunter Biden [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=408.2s)]
*  investigation, also the Department of Justice and the IRS were involved. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=413.79999999999995s)]
*  And so it's the classic what Trump called the deep state. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=419.12s)]
*  And they couldn't control him. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=423.03999999999996s)]
*  He's always been an uncontrollable person. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  And that's, I guess, his gift, what made him so good as president and is allowing him [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=428.48s)]
*  now to do so well. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=435.56s)]
*  But it also makes him an existential threat to the blob, to the deep state. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=436.68s)]
*  So the impeachment, the first impeachment of Trump over Ukraine should have been the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=442.2s)]
*  tip off to the rest of us that Ukraine was really the kind of the whole point for these [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=447.64s)]
*  people. And I remember thinking, well, it was just an excuse they were using because [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=452.96000000000004s)]
*  they wanted to impeach Trump. But no, it really was the third rail for them. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=457.48s)]
*  Yeah. In hindsight, it was incredible that Donald Trump got impeached for the sins of [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=461.32s)]
*  Joe Biden, effectively, doing exactly like being accused of doing exactly what Joe Biden [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=467.16s)]
*  did, which was to withhold USAID. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=473.72s)]
*  Joe Biden withheld a billion dollars of USAID so that the president Poroshenko of [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=476.6s)]
*  Ukraine fired the honest prosecutor who was investigating the company that was paying [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=483.72s)]
*  his son a million dollars a year. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  And Donald Trump made in a conversation with Zelensky, he said, you know, can you please [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  investigate the Biden family stopping the prosecution of Burisma, this energy company [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=499.28000000000003s)]
*  in Ukraine. And for that and for supposedly talking about or withholding aid for like a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=507.12s)]
*  millisecond from Ukraine, he got impeached. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=514.8s)]
*  We only know about that conversation because he was spied on and then the contents were [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=518.36s)]
*  leaked, correct? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=523.0s)]
*  No. I mean, the conversation he had with Zelensky is public. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=524.84s)]
*  I mean, it's listened to and there's a readout. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=527.92s)]
*  But I guess and he then released a transcript himself. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=531.36s)]
*  But you're not meant to have a verbatim American people isn't meant to have a verbatim [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=534.76s)]
*  transcript. These phone calls, for some reason, are not actually recorded. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=538.24s)]
*  They're just sort of transcribed. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=542.24s)]
*  But yeah, it was leaked by a Ukrainian American sort of, I don't know, he was in the in the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=544.16s)]
*  State Department at the time listening. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=552.56s)]
*  And the crime was threatening to withhold aid as if Ukraine is a constitutional right to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=554.24s)]
*  American tax dollars or something. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=561.0s)]
*  I don't understand the. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=562.72s)]
*  Well, because they said that it was a it was it was of political benefit to him, even though [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=564.72s)]
*  Joe Biden was not candidate for president at the time. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=569.48s)]
*  They said that that somehow Donald Trump knew that Joe Biden, who was the least likely to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=572.32s)]
*  become the Democratic candidate, that somehow Donald Trump's had a crystal ball and [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=577.72s)]
*  figured out that it was Joe Biden. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=583.8000000000001s)]
*  Actually, I mean, Donald Trump knew that there was nefarious stuff going on in Ukraine. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=586.12s)]
*  And he'd had his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was looking into it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  And he suspected that Ukraine was involved in interfering with his campaign in 2016 and [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=599.12s)]
*  getting his campaign manager, a guy called Manafort, basically ended up being jailed. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=606.12s)]
*  And I'm not I'm not defending Manafort. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=612.52s)]
*  I think he was like a lot of grifters, American grifters in Ukraine, very corrupt country, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=614.16s)]
*  the most corrupt country in Europe. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=618.48s)]
*  They were out there with their hands out. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=620.56s)]
*  So, I mean, the Republicans doing it, but the Bidens were doing it. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=623.16s)]
*  And I think that, you know, Joe Biden as vice president sold out the country in many [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=627.4s)]
*  ways. And Ukraine was part of that for a few million dollars for his family and, you know, [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=633.36s)]
*  maybe 25 million that we've discovered from China and Ukraine and Russia and Romania and so [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=640.12s)]
*  on. But, you know, I think Ukraine has just been an obsession by the blob because they [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=645.4000000000001s)]
*  think they're trying to weaken Russia. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  And they think the way to do that is they want to wean Europe off Russian energy. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=658.12s)]
*  And and they had this fantasy that Ukraine was going to be able to supply Europe with the [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=664.9599999999999s)]
*  energy that Russia didn't once they cut off. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=671.64s)]
*  But it's impossible because Ukraine has three percent of the shale gas deposits that Russia [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=673.88s)]
*  has. So it doesn't make sense. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=679.52s)]
*  Why? Why would they care? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  Like, why? I don't know. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=685.76s)]
*  I've never understood why Russia's bad. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=687.9599999999999s)]
*  Me neither. My actual theory. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=689.72s)]
*  I have two theories. One is that because it's sort of orthodox Christian. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=692.8s)]
*  And so the now America has always sort of exported its way of life and its democracy. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=698.64s)]
*  And that's been a benign thing until maybe the last decade when the State Department is now [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=705.08s)]
*  thinks that its role in exporting American culture is LGBTQ stuff, which goes right down to, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=711.36s)]
*  I think, in Indonesia, a very conservative kind of Muslim country. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=720.88s)]
*  I think it was Indonesia or anyway, was a country like that where they were having like drag [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=726.0s)]
*  drag queen story time. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  The State Department was funding that, you know, which just causes great hostility in these [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=733.52s)]
*  conservative countries. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=738.68s)]
*  It damages America's interests to impose these social sort of bizarre social norms onto [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=740.0s)]
*  these like maybe culturally conservative countries. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=748.0400000000001s)]
*  And I think Russia is regarded as culturally conservative. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=753.8000000000001s)]
*  Putin has allied himself with the Orthodox Church. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=757.24s)]
*  I don't think necessarily because he himself is religious at all, but just because it's a source of [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=761.2s)]
*  power for him. And, you know, you see it in Poland, a lot of those Eastern Bloc countries, they [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=766.1600000000001s)]
*  really reject this cultural imperialism from America. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=774.84s)]
*  It happened in Afghanistan. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=779.64s)]
*  I mean, when Kabul fell, the pride flag was hanging over the brand new embassy that the [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=780.84s)]
*  Americans had built. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=788.64s)]
*  So that's... [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=789.76s)]
*  They hung a pride flag in Afghanistan? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=790.9200000000001s)]
*  Yes. So this is just all that does is antagonize everyone around the world. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=793.08s)]
*  And I don't think the American people want, agree with it or... [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=801.36s)]
*  Why would it be exporting homosexuality? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=805.76s)]
*  Yeah. And transgender, you know, transing your children. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=808.48s)]
*  But why would the US government even have that in its portfolio? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=811.64s)]
*  Why is it the US government's business who you sleep with? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=815.04s)]
*  Well, because that Joe Biden came in promising equity and he just gave an interview to The [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=818.04s)]
*  Blade, I think, just boasting about how important his administration had been in [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=824.88s)]
*  promoting transgender rights, rainbow rights. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=833.0s)]
*  So I don't... [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=838.08s)]
*  And it's sort of a shadow agenda that most Americans aren't really aware of. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=839.96s)]
*  But you saw it when Joe Biden invited this transgender woman who came to the White [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=846.5999999999999s)]
*  House and bared her breasts. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=855.7199999999999s)]
*  She's really a man. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=857.68s)]
*  Bared her breasts for the cameras in the White House. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=859.16s)]
*  And the pride flag was adorning the White House at equal status with the American flag. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=862.88s)]
*  And people were outraged by that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=869.3599999999999s)]
*  But I don't think... [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=870.9599999999999s)]
*  And we wonder why we're getting all these hurricanes. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=871.56s)]
*  It's not global warming, sorry. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=873.44s)]
*  It's the trannies in the White House. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=878.08s)]
*  Well, we've always had hurricanes though. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=879.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=881.12s)]
*  But you can see why they'd be increasing in frequency after stuff like that. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=882.2s)]
*  Well, that's just amazing. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=886.2800000000001s)]
*  But I think that's one reason why Russia has resisted and they are trying to impose on [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=887.08s)]
*  Russia. Same with Hungary. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=893.48s)]
*  Remember, America has sent... [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=894.5600000000001s)]
*  Hungary is kind of traditionally Catholic and quite culturally conservative. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=896.84s)]
*  And so what does America do? [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=901.32s)]
*  Send a gay ambassador with a husband and adopted kids to just talk about nothing but [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=903.12s)]
*  gay rights in Hungary. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=910.24s)]
*  He's got an IQ of about 80 and doesn't speak Hungarian and is lecturing everyone in the [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=910.96s)]
*  country about how immoral they are. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=915.2s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, send him to Australia. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=916.92s)]
*  He would be embraced. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=918.56s)]
*  They would love him. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=919.8s)]
*  But you don't... [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=921.12s)]
*  Why would you antagonize a country that's conservative and is having its own... [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=921.8s)]
*  Well, that's the purpose of diplomacy, right? [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=927.0s)]
*  It is to make your potential allies hate you. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=928.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So I think that's one reason that the State Department has a loathing for Russia. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=932.76s)]
*  But also, I think it's because... [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=939.04s)]
*  This is my theory, I have no proof for it. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=942.0s)]
*  But that, you know, China seems to be much more of a threat than Russia, which is a small [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=943.68s)]
*  GDP. It really isn't that much of a threat to America, whereas China is encroaching, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=948.88s)]
*  you know, it's imperialist. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=955.2s)]
*  It's very aggressive now in the South China Sea. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=957.96s)]
*  It's trapping all these little countries in debt traps. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=962.2s)]
*  The Belt and Road Initiative is an imperialist objective and it's directly threatening to [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=967.12s)]
*  the United States. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=971.64s)]
*  So I think that the Wall Street or the people that fund the blob and fund the wars don't [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=973.16s)]
*  want the American people to realize that China is the real threat. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=981.56s)]
*  So they focus their attention on Russia and so that we just forget about China. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=986.0799999999999s)]
*  And it's amazing how many Americans fall for it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=992.5999999999999s)]
*  I say that with sadness. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=994.68s)]
*  They fall for it. I mean, what was Russia's imperial aims? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=997.2399999999999s)]
*  No. What threat does Russia post to the United States except a nuclear response to provocation [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1001.16s)]
*  from NATO? I don't... [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1007.0799999999999s)]
*  But people kind of fall for it. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1008.8399999999999s)]
*  It's like the worst person in the world is Putin. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1009.88s)]
*  OK, maybe he's a bad guy, but is that... [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1011.5999999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of bad guys around. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1014.4s)]
*  There are a lot of bad guys. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1015.4799999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of bad guys, including in our government. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1016.5999999999999s)]
*  So it's interesting. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1018.5999999999999s)]
*  But you think the point of Ukraine is to destabilize Russia. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1022.28s)]
*  Yeah. And the point of destabilizing Russia is because they won't bow to American cultural [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1027.9199999999998s)]
*  imperialism on the gay stuff. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1032.2s)]
*  Not entirely. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1034.44s)]
*  I just think that that gives sort of impetus and passion to those people in the State [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1035.52s)]
*  Department who, you know, everyone needs to be on the same song sheet and they all need [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1042.04s)]
*  to hate Russia. And so why you have to try and understand why do they hate Russia so [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1049.64s)]
*  much? What's Russia done to them? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1054.04s)]
*  And, you know, I do think that the fact that they're sort of... [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1055.96s)]
*  I mean, remember the dramas when Putin imposed some sort of anti-gay law? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't think it was...it wasn't actually anti-gay. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1066.56s)]
*  It was kind of what Ron DeSantis is trying to do in Florida is just stop this grooming [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1068.6399999999999s)]
*  and encroachment on childhood. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1074.7199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you can't throw sexual propaganda at children. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1077.32s)]
*  That would be like the, you know, anti-kid toucher law. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1081.0s)]
*  That would be totally conventional in any normal country. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1084.1999999999998s)]
*  That's right. And, you know, you can't fund hormone replacement and genital mutilation [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1086.52s)]
*  for 12 year olds. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1093.32s)]
*  You know, you don't want to set kids on the path of changing their sex. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1094.8s)]
*  So leave them alone until they're 18. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1099.2s)]
*  I think that's pretty reasonable. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1101.68s)]
*  But that's seen as being anti-gay. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1103.88s)]
*  Amazing. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1107.08s)]
*  It's funny how some of the biggest threats to your personal liberty are never discussed [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1107.88s)]
*  in the media. Maybe that's on purpose. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1112.0s)]
*  Here's one of them. It's called Section 7. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1114.48s)]
*  Oh, two. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1116.84s)]
*  What is seven? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1117.88s)]
*  Oh, two. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1118.64s)]
*  Well, Section 7, oh, two refers to a part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1119.8s)]
*  FISA, and it allows warrantless surveillance of American citizens. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1125.04s)]
*  Now, that's against our Bill of Rights, of course, but that has not prevented your U.S. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1130.56s)]
*  Congress from extending it again for another two years. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1135.04s)]
*  That means your elected representatives have allowed the United States government to spy [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1138.92s)]
*  on you. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1145.48s)]
*  They've weaponized your government, which you pay for, against you, its own citizens. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1145.96s)]
*  So what can you do about that? [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1151.04s)]
*  Well, you can vote out anybody who made that possible, including the current Speaker of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1152.72s)]
*  the House. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1156.52s)]
*  But in the meantime, you can take steps to protect yourself from their spying. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1157.0s)]
*  And one of the ways you can do that is by protecting your Internet browsing history. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1160.8400000000001s)]
*  Yes, your Internet service provider tracks every click you make online and then sells [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1166.28s)]
*  that information. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1174.28s)]
*  That goes to companies trying to sell you things, but it also goes to the federal agencies [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1175.52s)]
*  that want to spy on you and manipulate you with that information. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1180.24s)]
*  That is happening to you. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1184.4s)]
*  It has definitely already happened to us. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1186.96s)]
*  We verified that. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1188.96s)]
*  No, thanks. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1189.92s)]
*  We recommend a product called ExpressVPN. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1190.96s)]
*  ExpressVPN is a personal private network that reroutes 100% of your Internet activity through [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1194.24s)]
*  secure encrypted channels. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1200.48s)]
*  Now, why is that important? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1202.32s)]
*  Well, because it keeps what you're doing online private, not because you're doing anything [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1204.32s)]
*  wrong, but because privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1208.8s)]
*  No privacy, no freedom. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1212.8s)]
*  So if you want to protect yourself, we recommend ExpressVPN. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1214.8s)]
*  Go to expressvpn.com slash Tucker and you'll get three extra months of privacy for free. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1218.8s)]
*  That's expressvpn.com slash Tucker. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1224.8s)]
*  So nothing this all can, I mean, you've written about this for several years now, pretty conclusively, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1227.84s)]
*  I would say you had an amazing book on Hunter Biden's laptop, which sort of substantiates [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1236.1599999999999s)]
*  a lot of what you're saying. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1241.52s)]
*  But no one has ever been punished for it. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1244.0s)]
*  There was no effect, really. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1245.76s)]
*  No. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1248.32s)]
*  So that's why I wrote the second book, The Big Guy, which is Joe Biden's code name that [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1248.56s)]
*  Hunter Biden's former business partners like Tony Bobulinski had to use to refer to Joe Biden [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1254.96s)]
*  because the family was so paranoid about his involvement. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1262.0s)]
*  And I think the first book, The Laptop from Hell that we at the New York Post wrote about [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1265.3600000000001s)]
*  and then got censored by Big Tech. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  At the time, that was before the 2020 election, and we didn't really understand how this was [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1274.64s)]
*  happening. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1281.68s)]
*  We just thought, oh, Twitter and Facebook are just woke and they want Joe Biden to win, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1281.92s)]
*  so they're censoring us. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1285.8400000000001s)]
*  But what we found out after the election, in part thanks to Elon Musk opening up the [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1287.44s)]
*  Twitter files and also because of a whole lot of the once the Republicans took the house [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1292.88s)]
*  in 2022 or after 22, they got to subpoena a whole lot of documents and also interview [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1299.04s)]
*  witnesses plus whistleblowers from the FBI told us that the reason that Twitter and Facebook [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1308.4s)]
*  censored us was because they'd been warned by the FBI for weeks ahead of our story even [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1315.52s)]
*  appearing to look out for a Russian hack and leak operation likely in October, likely [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1321.92s)]
*  involving Hunter Biden. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1330.48s)]
*  And so when Twitter and Facebook saw our story on October 14, 2020, they recognised it [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1332.56s)]
*  immediately as the Russian hack and leak dump. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1339.28s)]
*  How would the FBI know? [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1343.36s)]
*  Well, the FBI was spying on Rudy Giuliani, who was Donald Trump's personal lawyer. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1345.52s)]
*  They unbeknownst to him, they had a covert surveillance warrant on his iCloud. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1351.52s)]
*  And so they would have had access to the email that came to him in August of 2020 from John Paul [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1357.44s)]
*  MacIsaac, who was, I think you've interviewed him, the laptop repair shop owner who had the laptop [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1364.8000000000002s)]
*  that Hunter had abandoned at his shop. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1371.92s)]
*  And the FBI had actually subpoenaed that laptop in December of 2019. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1375.5200000000002s)]
*  They had it in their possession. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1381.7600000000002s)]
*  They'd had it for 10 months when they were telling Twitter and Facebook, oh no, this is [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1383.9199999999998s)]
*  Russian disinformation, you know, you must censor. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1388.4799999999998s)]
*  And then a few days after we were censored, out comes the Dirty 51 letter and it was the [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1392.8799999999999s)]
*  open letter by 51 former intelligence officials, most of them CIA, I think 42 ex-CIA, including [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  John Brennan and Leon Panetta and James Clapper. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1407.36s)]
*  There were five either directors or acting directors of the CIA who signed that dishonest [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1410.96s)]
*  letter that said that the laptop was Russian disinformation and therefore our reporting was [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1416.8s)]
*  Russian disinformation. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1421.76s)]
*  They called it, they said it had all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1423.92s)]
*  So now if any of them respond to any questions about it and they just say, well, we didn't say [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1430.0s)]
*  it was Russian disinformation, we said information operation, same thing. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1436.88s)]
*  And they knew because they leaked it to Politico and then the Washington Post and New York Times [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1440.72s)]
*  picked it up and all the headlines were Russian disinformation, the laptop. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1446.64s)]
*  So that killed the story stone dead. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1450.48s)]
*  And two days later, Joe Biden gets up on stage with Donald Trump in the last debate and he [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1453.44s)]
*  uses that letter to basically get out of jail free and the story never ever became anything. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1460.56s)]
*  But what we now know is that that letter was not just signed by these formers, but that it was [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1468.16s)]
*  cleared by the internal CIA classification review board in record time. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1476.24s)]
*  And even they saw it and thought it was overtly political just three weeks before an election. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1482.72s)]
*  So they sent it upstairs to Gina Haspel, who was then the CIA director under Donald Trump. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1487.8400000000001s)]
*  And she gave it the green light to be published immediately. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1494.24s)]
*  And so the Dirty 51 letter was actually a domestic CIA interference operation with the election. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1498.08s)]
*  And that just boggles your mind once you realize. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1507.68s)]
*  What happened in Gina Haspel? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1510.96s)]
*  Well, she obviously left and she now has a job in some, it's either a law firm or something. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1512.72s)]
*  It's one of the stables that disloyal Democrat lovers end up going and making lots of money in. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1519.68s)]
*  But never punished, retains her security clearance. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1529.76s)]
*  Of course, all of them do. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1532.64s)]
*  All the 51. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1533.92s)]
*  And in fact, several of these signatories are not just former CIA people, but they're [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1534.96s)]
*  active CIA contractors today. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1541.68s)]
*  But why not pull that? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1544.3200000000002s)]
*  I've never understood. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1545.2s)]
*  No one has a right to a security clearance. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1546.88s)]
*  Period. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1549.68s)]
*  And people have them pulled all the time. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1550.24s)]
*  Unpopular people have their security clearances pulled, at which point they can't work with the US government. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1552.4s)]
*  And they can't, they don't have access to information that I, as a taxpayer, don't have access to. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1556.72s)]
*  Why not just pull their security clearances? [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1561.92s)]
*  Like every single one of them, day one. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1563.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's what Donald Trump should have done. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1565.52s)]
*  But he had a couple of months, I guess. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1569.1200000000001s)]
*  And it took a while for this all to settle in, everyone to really understand what they did. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1570.96s)]
*  They actually did interfere with the election because, I mean, we know now from polls that [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1577.84s)]
*  enough Biden voters would have changed their vote if they'd known about Joe Biden's corruption. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1583.12s)]
*  You know, even if they just knew that he'd been lying to the American people during the campaign, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1588.56s)]
*  when he said, I know nothing about my son Hunter's overseas business dealings. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1592.8799999999999s)]
*  And yet we had on the front page an email from Hunter's Ukrainian sort of paymaster [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1597.12s)]
*  from that company, Burisma, who thanked Hunter for introducing him to his father in Washington, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1604.48s)]
*  DC, the then sitting vice president. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1611.1999999999998s)]
*  We found out after the election that was a dinner at Cafe Milano, which you probably know in [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1614.32s)]
*  Georgetown that Hunter- [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1619.04s)]
*  Been there all my life. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1621.04s)]
*  Yeah. Well, Hunter organized that for his father, the vice president in a private room, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1621.9199999999998s)]
*  to meet with his Ukrainian business partners, plus Russian, plus Kazakhstanis. He did a three [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1628.4s)]
*  for one deal in April of 2015. And Joe Biden denied that he'd ever met these people. He sat [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1634.16s)]
*  down, he had dinner. And it was only when the Washington Post, just trying to fact check my [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1640.72s)]
*  story about the Cafe Milano dinner, you know, their four Pinocchios people were very- Glenn [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1646.88s)]
*  Kessler was certain that, you know, I'd made it up or it was wrong. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  Their four Pinocchios people. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1656.4s)]
*  And the White House then admitted to Glenn Kessler, not never to me, that yes, Joe Biden [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1659.44s)]
*  did go to that dinner, but he didn't do it for any nefarious purpose and he only stayed for a [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1664.16s)]
*  short time, which is not true because someone who was there told me that he was there for the entire [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1668.48s)]
*  dinner. And he might not, like, it's not like Joe Biden is going to talk about the finer details of, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1674.0s)]
*  you know, how much money you're going to pay Hunter, but he just has to show up and be charming [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1679.44s)]
*  and be the vice president for all the money to flow into Hunter's pockets. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1684.08s)]
*  Has he ever answered any substantial questions about this? [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1692.1599999999999s)]
*  No. The only time that he's sort of asked the questions is actually by the New York Post's [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1696.6399999999999s)]
*  Washington correspondent, Stephen Nelson, and by Steve Doocy, Peter Doocy, sorry, from Fox News. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1703.76s)]
*  And all they managed to do is shout questions across to him. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1710.48s)]
*  But in all the interviews that Biden has done as president in four years, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1714.24s)]
*  no reporters ever said, let's just go through this for a second. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1718.0s)]
*  No. Oh, no, there was someone I think from, might have been CBS, it was a woman, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1720.72s)]
*  that was standing up, he gets very aggressive. And then the Axios, there was an Axios reporter too. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1726.48s)]
*  He just, Joe Biden, people underestimate his aggressiveness. He's very good at it. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1733.28s)]
*  You, he's very nasty. And so if you ask him a question he doesn't like, it's almost like [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1739.28s)]
*  this narcissistic rage, quite frightening. And you see reporters recoil. And you ask him anything [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1744.32s)]
*  around Hunter's sort of, or the family corruption, because it's just also Joe's younger brother, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1752.0s)]
*  Jim Biden, he gets very aggressive and nasty and pushes back. So he's successful in that. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1758.32s)]
*  Why did the CIA dislike Trump so much? It's clearly not because they thought he was unfit [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1768.96s)]
*  to be president. They supported a senile man for president. So that's not an important criterion [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1774.08s)]
*  for them. What's the real reason they hated Trump so much? Because Trump is uncontrollable. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1779.36s)]
*  He's always been uncontrollable since he was a child. He's, that's his sort of magic strength, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1784.08s)]
*  I think, that he won't be told what to do by anybody. And you saw the effect of that during [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1791.76s)]
*  the four years that he was president. Suddenly the blobs agenda was to the wayside, because [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1798.56s)]
*  Donald Trump treats foreign policy just like domestic policy, just the way he did when he [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1805.36s)]
*  was a property developer in Queens. He acts on first principles, logically, common sense. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1810.32s)]
*  He looks at an issue and he goes, oh, this is a problem I'm just going to treat. Like for instance, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1816.8s)]
*  when he became president, Barack Obama said to him, the biggest problem that we have is North [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1821.76s)]
*  Korea, because Kim Jong-un keeps on detonating all these nuclear tests and he's a problem. And so [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1827.68s)]
*  Donald Trump neutralized that. He put Kim Jong-un in a box and he was mocked mercilessly for it, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1834.8s)]
*  you know, little rocket man, it's bromance with Kim Jong-un. But it worked. Same thing with [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1840.96s)]
*  Putin. You know, Trump's just very belligerent. He just makes threats and people don't know if he [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1846.8s)]
*  means it or not. I think he threatened Putin that, you know, those lovely domes in Moscow, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1856.48s)]
*  shame if something happened to them. And Putin didn't invade any countries while Trump was [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1861.2s)]
*  president, like he did when Obama was president, like he did immediately when Biden was president. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1867.76s)]
*  So Putin was in his box. Iran, on its knees, it was completely broke. It didn't have the money [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1872.8s)]
*  to fund the proxies to attack Israel like it did last October 7. You know, the Middle East, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1879.84s)]
*  whatever you think, I mean, the Abraham Accords were the promise of peace in the Middle East, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1886.08s)]
*  which had been, you know, the mantra of so many presidents for decades. And suddenly Trump comes [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1891.04s)]
*  in and he kind of starts to pull it off. And that was anathema to the blob controllers, because [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1897.84s)]
*  the agenda, whatever agenda they have, which I kind of think is still opaque, I don't really [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1908.56s)]
*  understand it completely. But their agenda is the opposite of what the American people want. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1913.84s)]
*  And that's why Donald Trump didn't follow their agenda. And that's why he was so successful in [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1922.96s)]
*  foreign policy. And they don't want that. So I think that the idea that he would become president [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1931.2s)]
*  again is an existential threat to them and their power. And that's why they will do whatever it [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1938.24s)]
*  takes to ensure that he doesn't win. And we've seen they've attacked him with lawfare, to [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1945.84s)]
*  assassination attempts. They've totally demonized him. So half the country thinks he's Hitler. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1953.2s)]
*  And it still hasn't worked. If he does get elected, I think it's pretty clear he can't [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1959.44s)]
*  really govern with a government like the one we have now or the one we had between 16 and 20. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1966.8s)]
*  Do you think it'll be possible to in four years uproot the rot? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1973.12s)]
*  I mean, no, I don't think so. Although the thing is, he's much wiser than we all are, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1978.96s)]
*  than we were. I look back even in 2020 and think how naive we were. I mean, this happens all the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1986.24s)]
*  time. Like in 2016, you think you're naive after the Iraq war, you think you're naive. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1993.28s)]
*  You can never be too cynical, I think. And so he knows a lot more now. And he knew that the [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=1998.8799999999999s)]
*  deep state was a problem, but I don't think he realized the extent they would go to to [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2005.04s)]
*  cripple his administration, which they pretty successfully did. It's amazing he achieved as [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2009.6s)]
*  much as he did considering he had the Russia hoax hanging over him, the Mueller investigation. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2014.0s)]
*  You know, he's just coming out of it into the clear and then COVID hit. So [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2020.08s)]
*  I think he'll be older and wiser. I think he will not be as naive about the people he puts around [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2027.36s)]
*  him. He admits himself that he made mistakes in personnel. And I think that's why this demonization [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2032.24s)]
*  of the project 2025 or whatever it is from the Heritage Foundation has been so effective because [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2038.48s)]
*  they know that what Trump needs is a really good group of 2000 people to install day one [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2045.84s)]
*  in his administration. And that was really the central premise of project 2025. But I think he's [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2052.96s)]
*  got a good group of people. Like he's got Howard Lutnick, who knows about how to hire 2000 good [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2060.56s)]
*  people at the moment's notice because he had to do it with Cantor Fitzgerald after September 11. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2067.44s)]
*  And now he's got Elon Musk, you, RFK Jr. He's got a phalanx of smart people who are not [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2071.6s)]
*  traditional Republicans, but who are wise about the deep state and the kind of [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2078.08s)]
*  existential threat to democracy that they are, even though they project that and demonize Trump [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2085.8399999999997s)]
*  for it. And so a lot of people, Silicon Valley, they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2091.12s)]
*  They're going to be able to demonize Trump for it. And so a lot of people, Silicon Valley, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2097.12s)]
*  they see that Trump is actually the answer and not the problem. And so they're backing him. So [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2101.44s)]
*  you would hope with that brain's trust that he's going to be able to at least make a dent on it. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2110.56s)]
*  I don't think in four years he's going to be able to solve the problem of the CIA, the FBI, and [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2115.36s)]
*  the State Department. But he'll probably fire the top three layers and it'll be messy. And they [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2120.56s)]
*  will probably stage, I don't know, I mean, the worst thing you can imagine. I don't want to [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2130.32s)]
*  jinx it, but domestic terrorist attacks. America's been thankfully free of that. Unlike England, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2134.56s)]
*  Australia, most countries have had Islamist terrorist attacks, unlike America. So whether [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2144.32s)]
*  that's because American culture intrinsically sort of allows immigrants to feel American, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2152.32s)]
*  so they don't hate America as much, or because CIA, FBI did a great job, I don't know. But I [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2160.4s)]
*  would imagine that that'll be used as an excuse and a way to weaken Trump. But he's only got one [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2167.28s)]
*  term. That seems likely to me. Is it? Yeah. I would think so. Yeah, that and pulling the [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2175.28s)]
*  supports out from underneath the economy. Yes, because Janet Yellen's been propping up Joe [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2181.44s)]
*  Biden's economy and the stock market. Yeah. That's ugly. I just want to go back for one moment [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2188.6400000000003s)]
*  to Biden's behavior as vice president. Pretty out in the open. I mean, his son, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2195.52s)]
*  Hunter, is flying around the world raising money on his father's name. What does Barack Obama, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2201.68s)]
*  the then president, think of this? Yeah, that was strange. I mean, he was aware of Joe Biden's [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2207.52s)]
*  corruption issues because when they were vetting Biden to be vice president, this was a [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2215.52s)]
*  major issue and Hunter had to resign from various lobbying gigs that he had and was very resentful [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2223.04s)]
*  of it. In fact, he resented Obama and the Obama White House because they kept on putting crimps [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2228.2400000000002s)]
*  on his ability to use the White House to make money. And like, for instance, when [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2233.76s)]
*  Hunter first joined the Burisma board, his best friend in business, Devin Archer, who [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2244.1600000000003s)]
*  is now an anti-Biden person, but was then on the Burisma board with Hunter. He was invited with [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2249.6s)]
*  Hunter to the White House to meet with Joe Biden and ostensibly for a school project. But what came [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2260.56s)]
*  out of it was a photograph of Joe Biden, the vice president, with Hunter's business partner, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2268.16s)]
*  Devin Archer, just joined the board of Burisma. Hunter took the photo. Burisma put that photo [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2274.4s)]
*  on their website and that became a problem for the White House when they realised. So the sort of [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2281.6000000000004s)]
*  ethics czar or the White House council actually contacted Hunter Biden's business partner, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2289.84s)]
*  another business partner, and said, quick, take it down. So it was an emergency situation, but it was [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2295.28s)]
*  enough. It was seen and it was enough of an embarrassment for David Ignatius of all people [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2301.28s)]
*  at the Washington Post to write a column excoriating Joe Biden for being so sloppy. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2307.52s)]
*  HOFFMAN David Ignatius being the CIA spokesman at the Washington Post. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2312.88s)]
*  LESLIE Yeah. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2316.7200000000003s)]
*  HOFFMAN Yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2317.0400000000004s)]
*  LESLIE Yeah. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2317.44s)]
*  HOFFMAN Foreign policy columnist. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2317.6800000000003s)]
*  LESLIE Like Philip Bump. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2319.44s)]
*  HOFFMAN So what about that? You spent your life in journalism, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2322.48s)]
*  the daughter of a famous journalist. At what point did the overwhelming majority of journalists [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2329.6s)]
*  become more loyal to the CIA than to their readers? LESLIE Yeah, I don't know. I mean, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2336.48s)]
*  my father was a journalist in Tokyo in the 1960s and he said it was crawling with spies then. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2341.52s)]
*  So journalism, especially in the Cold War, was full of, well, those august publications like New [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2348.88s)]
*  York Times, the Washington Post, full of spies back then. I mean, your dad would know as well [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2355.28s)]
*  from, because he was a journalist in that era. I think it was really journalism and spies were [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2360.48s)]
*  good friends and great sources and also kind of interchangeable in some ways. So maybe nothing [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2366.96s)]
*  has changed. HOFFMAN Well, I think that's actually fair now that you're saying it out loud. I think [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2374.0800000000004s)]
*  that is, in fact, I think I know for a fact that that's true. So you're right. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2377.6000000000004s)]
*  LESLIE But the difference is that I think the CIA used, well, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2381.1200000000003s)]
*  we used to think, I don't know if I even question myself about this now, but we used to think that [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2384.48s)]
*  they were on the side of the angels. Like, they were promoting truth, justice and the American [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2389.2s)]
*  way and that was a good thing. But I think they've turned, you know, they are now not acting in [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2394.56s)]
*  America's best interests. I don't know if a rogue element has crept in. I don't know if, you know, [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2402.2400000000002s)]
*  because of that they recruit smart kids from universities and those kids have already been [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2408.64s)]
*  brainwashed. John Brennan was a communist, you know, like known to be at one point. So maybe just [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2413.52s)]
*  the people they're recruiting have changed the culture of the CIA to be more anti-American, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2423.04s)]
*  like, you know, the universities are like the institutions are. So maybe that's just an organic [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2427.92s)]
*  thing that's happened. But certainly they're not acting in the best interests of what the American [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2433.6s)]
*  natural disasters, wars, political conflicts, the recent threatened dock workers strikes at ports [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2440.32s)]
*  around the country. All of these are reminders that things that we take for granted in this country, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2447.92s)]
*  like medicine, are all dependent on a long and fragile supply chain. If something happens to [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2454.2400000000002s)]
*  that supply chain, you and your family will not be able to get things that you need to live. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2460.8s)]
*  So right now seems like a pretty good time to stock up on essentials for when the next unexpected [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2467.84s)]
*  disaster hits, because it's coming. We know that. That's why we're partnering with JACE Medical, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2473.6800000000003s)]
*  which can supply you and your family directly to your home with things you need. Quick, easy, [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2479.92s)]
*  affordable solutions for problems that require life-saving medication for ones in your family [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2486.96s)]
*  in the case of an emergency. So the JACE case is a personalized emergency medication kit [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2492.96s)]
*  that contains essential antibiotics and medications to treat the most common and potentially deadly [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2498.08s)]
*  bacterial infections, for example, and then a whole host of add-on medicines from ivermectin [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2503.44s)]
*  to epipens, depending on what you and your family may need. How hard is it to get this? Not hard. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2508.96s)]
*  The process is quick and easy. You fill out an online form, you consult with their physician, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2514.6400000000003s)]
*  and you receive your medications through a licensed pharmacy at a fraction of the regular [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2519.6s)]
*  price. It is all totally above board, completely legit, and in the case of a disruption to our [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2524.24s)]
*  supply chain, which again could very easily happen, it could mean the difference between [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2529.8399999999997s)]
*  surviving and not. So we recommend it. Go to JACE.com, use code TUCKER at checkout for a discount [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2533.7599999999998s)]
*  on your order. That's JACE, J-A-S-E dot com promo code TUCKER. Certainly now though, it's pretty [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2539.7599999999998s)]
*  obvious that there's a massive disconnect between the agenda of the blob, State Department, DOD, CIA, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2549.04s)]
*  NSA, all the armed federal agencies, and American voters. There's just not really a big overlap [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2556.0s)]
*  between what one group wants and what the country itself wants. So at some point, don't journalists [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2562.24s)]
*  have to say, well, I don't know, I'm supposed to represent my readers or viewers. They don't seem [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2567.6s)]
*  to have any sense of loyalty or obligation to the people they're supposedly serving. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2573.52s)]
*  Yeah, but think about the New York Times and the Washington Post. Who are the people that they're [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2579.04s)]
*  serving? Who really are the subscribers of the New York Times? We don't have any visibility into [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2583.84s)]
*  that. Do you think the New York Times really cares if the CCP buys up a million subscriptions at $1 [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2591.44s)]
*  a pop? The Washington Post, they're serving the blob. That's their people. They're the... [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2598.88s)]
*  Do you think it's possible that foreign governments buy subscriptions [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2605.44s)]
*  in bulk to try to influence news organizations? I don't know, but it makes sense. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2608.96s)]
*  It does. And we don't know if it is happening or not, because that's all proprietary information. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2614.48s)]
*  And why would the New York Times look too closely at the golden egg that the foreign goose laid? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2619.6s)]
*  Well, that's a fascinating possibility. I mean, you know that foreign governments, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2627.36s)]
*  Intel services are all over social media. I mean, well, that's one of the things we learned when [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2631.6s)]
*  Elon Musk bought Twitter is that foreign governments, a number of foreign governments, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2635.68s)]
*  had employees working there. Well, and the CIA and the FBI had, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2640.64s)]
*  they were so many at Twitter that they had like a support group, like they had their own Slack [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2644.24s)]
*  channels. Support group. And remember James Baker, he was the general counsel for the FBI [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2652.08s)]
*  during all the... He was involved in all that Russia collusion stuff. He was certainly there [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2662.0s)]
*  in the room. And then suddenly eight months before the 2020 election, he gets parachuted [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2666.24s)]
*  into Twitter as their number two lawyer. And he was involved, we now know from the Twitter files, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2672.16s)]
*  intimately in the censorship of the New York Post. There were people at Twitter, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2679.4399999999996s)]
*  including the much maligned Joel Roth, who was the chief censor. He was actually pushing back [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2683.7599999999998s)]
*  on this FBI CIA censorship. But James Baker was... Can I just ask you to pause? That's such a smart [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2690.16s)]
*  point. Joel Roth or something about him, it was he was easy to hate and blame, but it turned out [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2697.3599999999997s)]
*  Joel Roth was by far... He was a good guy. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. It's sad. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2702.56s)]
*  Well, it is sad. Have you spoken to him? No. But he wrote a sworn declaration for a separate [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2708.96s)]
*  court case in which he was just honest. He said that... He was the one that told us that the FBI [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2716.5600000000004s)]
*  came in and said, look out for this Russian disinformation in October about Underbiden. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2725.36s)]
*  So I've always had a soft spot for him. I thought, well, he's one of the few people there who's been [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2731.1200000000003s)]
*  truthful. He doesn't seem to have an agenda. You said that the FBI knew... I'm sorry, I'm jumping [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2735.84s)]
*  around, but there's just so much. You said that the FBI knew that the laptop was coming. Your [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2743.44s)]
*  reporting was on the way because they were spying on Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, which is [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2748.56s)]
*  pretty shocking that they would do that. They never found anything. Well, I know that we were [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2753.36s)]
*  being surveilled at that... I know for a fact in October of 2020, my producers and I were being [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2758.48s)]
*  surveilled. By the NSA? I don't know, by somebody who stole a hard drive with [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2765.04s)]
*  images from Hunter's laptop out of the UPS Sorting Center in New York. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2773.6s)]
*  Have you ever thought that because you've reported on this so extensively for so long that maybe [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2778.8s)]
*  your communications are not secure? Oh, I'm sure they're not. Yeah. In fact, when I talked to new [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2785.04s)]
*  people, like there were some former NYPD people, sorry, FBI and NYPD people, they said to me, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2793.2799999999997s)]
*  we're going to meet... We had to meet in person. They didn't trust. They said to me, your phones, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2801.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, I know you mean well, but there'll be people listening in on you. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2807.7599999999998s)]
*  Listening to the conversation in the room through the mic on the phone? [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2813.6s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know how they do it. I mean, just the fact we have our phones with us, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2816.64s)]
*  people who are super secure conscience, including Wall Street people and so on, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2821.6s)]
*  they leave their phones outside. But I kind of think I'm a journalist. And so, if I'm meeting [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2826.16s)]
*  with sources that don't want... So I always meet in person anyway, or we communicate with encrypted [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2832.7999999999997s)]
*  apps, which are probably not safe, but there are a couple that are maybe okay. When your reporting [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2838.64s)]
*  was censored, did anybody in the White House Press Corps or any fellow journalists you knew [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2844.48s)]
*  from other publications extend sympathy and say to you like, I think this is wrong what's happening? [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2849.68s)]
*  I mean, how did other journalists respond? Well, the usual ones you would expect would [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2854.7999999999997s)]
*  did. So the conservative ones. But no, I mean, I remember Maggie Haberman, who used to work [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2859.04s)]
*  at the New York Post, now New York Times star anti-Trump person. But she's just a normal [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2867.04s)]
*  reporter. Like she actually has good curiosity still. And so she tweeted our story because it [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2874.48s)]
*  was amazing. And there was another young reporter, I think from Politico or somewhere who also [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2881.12s)]
*  retweeted just like, oh, look what the New York Post has got, October surprise. And they were [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2887.28s)]
*  excoriated on Twitter by journalism professors for having the audacity to promote our story. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2894.08s)]
*  What's a journalism professor? Yeah, exactly. A propaganda professor, maybe that's what they [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2902.4s)]
*  are now. Is it a job that requires a specialized degree? Do you think? I did a degree at Northwestern. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2908.48s)]
*  No way! I did a master's in journalism and it was the best thing I ever did. Oh, come on. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2914.32s)]
*  No, it was brilliant. It was brilliant. This was in 96. So it was, it hadn't been polluted. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2920.64s)]
*  And there were some fantastic real journalists there. Chicago, not Columbia. So Chicago was [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2928.32s)]
*  okay then. Incredible. Yeah. No, it was wonderful. I learned so much about, you know, just the basics [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2934.4s)]
*  of journalism and there was no propaganda. Well, you just overturned my preconception. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2942.56s)]
*  But I think it's different now. Look, I look at Northwestern, I see what happens, but, [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2948.56s)]
*  and Columbia and the difference is that the new breed of journalists think that they [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2953.92s)]
*  have to change the world. And that's why they're slumming it and becoming journalists and not [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2961.04s)]
*  going to Wall Street. You know. I think if they were smart enough to lend money for a living, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2964.96s)]
*  they would. I think we're getting the dumb ones. So what exactly happened to Joe Biden? Is he still, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2971.28s)]
*  I mean, he has escaped any punishment for the many crimes that you've detailed at some length. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2978.72s)]
*  I don't think that's overstatement to say you've detailed the crimes of Joe Biden. He's never been [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2986.0s)]
*  punished. He never will be, I don't think. Is he still running the country? Was he ever running [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2990.24s)]
*  the country? Well, that's right, of course. Yeah. I mean, if you saw him in 2020 in, you know, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=2994.9599999999996s)]
*  on the campaign trail, basically in Iowa and New Hampshire, it was obvious that he was cognitively [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3002.16s)]
*  shocked. He'd have to have Dr. Jill lead him across the stage to make a stupid speech. He [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3009.12s)]
*  had teleprompters dragged into tiny town halls because no one was interested in him, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3014.9599999999996s)]
*  just to do basic stump speeches that any other politician could do in their sleep. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3020.72s)]
*  So it was amazing that things were rigged and that people like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg just [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3025.6s)]
*  agreed to step aside for him. But I guess he was the only palatable, available candidate that they [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3033.36s)]
*  had that they could pretend was a moderate to the American people. But I think with Joe Biden, [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3042.1600000000003s)]
*  sort of a mystery, everyone now is saying, oh, you know, he's senile. But I think with all these [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3049.28s)]
*  cognitive decline problems, it sort of waxes and wanes. And remember, he had those aneurysms back [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3055.52s)]
*  in, I think, the 80s. He had a couple of pretty serious brain bleeds. I remember very well. And [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3063.92s)]
*  brain operations. So you don't know how that factors in. Because I know people and foreign [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3068.88s)]
*  sort of heads of state who have met with Joe Biden behind closed doors for extended periods [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3076.72s)]
*  in Washington, DC, from two different countries. And they said he was completely lucid. This is [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3083.68s)]
*  halfway through his presidency. And I'm going, come on, no way. You know, you can tell me. It's [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3089.2s)]
*  off the record. No, no, no, they said. No, absolutely. He was compas mentis. He was running [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3094.08s)]
*  the agenda. Everyone around him like Antony Blinken was deferring to him. He only had like [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3100.3199999999997s)]
*  talking points on a piece of paper that he referred to occasionally. But he was definitely in charge. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3107.04s)]
*  So that's the good Joe Biden. But then someone else I spoke to who was there at one of those [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3112.4s)]
*  G20 or G8 summits in Cornwall in England, said that, and remember, there was footage of Joe [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3117.6000000000004s)]
*  Biden sort of wandering around aimlessly and looking lost. And apparently, he was completely [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3125.04s)]
*  out of it there. He was, you know, goosing Boris Johnson's wife and just acting very inappropriately. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3131.92s)]
*  And so I think that jet lag and, you know, the time of day when they can't quite control [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3139.68s)]
*  his environment that he, the senility sort of creeps in. But he still has lucid moments [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3146.72s)]
*  and maybe long moments. And we saw that every time he had to do a big set piece, except the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3154.64s)]
*  debate against Donald Trump, when it almost seemed like they let him out without a safety net, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3160.64s)]
*  you know, late at night when he'd been doing all this travelling and it was almost like he was set [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3166.0s)]
*  up to fail. And I think now he probably, you know, he's had sleep, he doesn't, he hasn't had to travel [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3172.4s)]
*  as much. He's vacationing all the time in his beach house. So I think he's probably in the best [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3181.36s)]
*  cognitive shape he's been in for a while. And he seems to be pretty lucid. You know, when you see [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3187.2000000000003s)]
*  him out giving speeches when he's undercutting Kamala Harris, as he did twice in the last few [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3195.2s)]
*  weeks, you know, when he said she just, she picked a fight with Ron DeSantis over the hurricane. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3202.48s)]
*  And Joe Biden just seamlessly comes in and says, oh, Ron DeSantis is a great guy. You know, [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3209.04s)]
*  I talked to him all the time. When he cut in, she was going to do a big speech in Detroit, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3214.24s)]
*  where she was going to take credit for ending the Longshoremen's impending strike. And Joe Biden, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3219.84s)]
*  just that moment decides to make an appearance in the Washington, you know, the press room for the [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3226.32s)]
*  first time ever. And of course, all the cameras cut from Detroit straight to Joe Biden. He didn't [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3232.5600000000004s)]
*  have much to say other than to say that he and Kamala Harris were joined at the hip, that we were [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3238.1600000000003s)]
*  singing from this, you know, we're on the same page and she's trying to turn the page. So I think [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3244.48s)]
*  that he's, and there's been reporting from behind the scenes that he is angry that Kamala Harris is [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3250.56s)]
*  trying to, or her campaign is trying to distance her from him and throwing him under the bus and [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3257.44s)]
*  trying to reject Bidenomics. She went to, I think, Pittsburgh and gave this economic speech in which, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3263.44s)]
*  either Pittsburgh or Chicago, in which she didn't mention Bidenomics. She did not pay tribute to Joe [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3271.6s)]
*  Biden for the fabulous economy that he's given everyone. So he was angry about that, apparently, [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3276.56s)]
*  and Dr. Jill's angry as well. Do you think it would be possible, I mean, Kamala Harris has got to be [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3281.44s)]
*  as controlled as Joe Biden was, correct? Same people. They're same people. You saw there was [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3289.04s)]
*  a letter like the Dirty 51 letter, where they got 251 people from the National Security Establishment [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3294.56s)]
*  some of them the same as the Dirty 51, about eight or nine of them were the same, including Leon Panetta. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3302.08s)]
*  And they're just saying that Kamala Harris is the most competent commander in chief that we could [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3308.72s)]
*  have, far superior to Donald Trump. And she's so unworthy of that. Incredible that these people [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3315.92s)]
*  would put their reputations on the line. Leon Panetta, former CIA director, former congressman [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3323.44s)]
*  from California, kind of an idiot, I can say since I know him. Hard to believe he ran CIA, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3327.84s)]
*  but he is telling us that Kamala Harris is the most qualified person to be president of the United [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3335.1200000000003s)]
*  States. Yeah, yeah. Far superior in every way to Donald Trump. But if you'll say that, then you'll [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3339.92s)]
*  say anything. Like reality doesn't matter to you. Like that Hunter Biden's laptop is Russian [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3345.36s)]
*  disinformation. They just lie and they get away with it and they're treated like, you know, [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3349.92s)]
*  eminent people. So you're an Australian who's lived in the United States for many, many years. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3357.84s)]
*  I think it's fair to say not to speak for you, but you love America, I think. I was born in America. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3363.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm an American citizen. Is that true? I was born in Queens, New York, just like Donald Trump. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3367.6800000000003s)]
*  Really? Yes. How? Because I'm an anchor baby. Oh, nice. So my parents were foreign correspondents. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3374.2400000000002s)]
*  My dad was a foreign correspondent and they were in New York. So I spent my first two years here. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3383.28s)]
*  So, okay, so as an American citizen who's lived in this country a long time. A dual national, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3389.6000000000004s)]
*  one of those evil globalists. Oh, you've really got another passport. Yeah. And I grew up in a lot [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3394.8s)]
*  of countries. So I'm sort of, I'm one of those people. Well, you are kind of a rootless, rootless [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3399.76s)]
*  cosmopolitan. I'm a globalist. I'm a rootless, I am. Yeah. But I mean, sometimes people who've lived [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3404.7200000000003s)]
*  a lot of places have a clearer perspective on this. If you have a country where nobody believes in [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3410.2400000000002s)]
*  the leadership, doesn't believe that they're morally justified in what they're doing, doesn't [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3414.48s)]
*  believe they're telling the truth about anything, assumes that their lips are moving, they're lying, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3419.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, how does your country continue? Don't you need that trust to have a voluntary system? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3423.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. A democracy? But like America is the last country that, where there is some sort of freedom [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3428.32s)]
*  and some sort of hope that, you know, the people can take back control of their government again. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3436.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that's because there's a, you know, residual feeling among Americans because of the [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3444.4s)]
*  revolution, because they are untamable like Donald Trump and they're sort of outlaws in a way. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3450.0s)]
*  And also because of the constitution, the first amendment, the second amendment, you know, that [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3458.32s)]
*  protects America from the sort of censorship that we've seen descend on Europe and Australia and [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3462.7200000000003s)]
*  New Zealand. And, you know, I know from Australia that, you know, people are like frogs in boiling [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3469.2000000000003s)]
*  water. They don't actually realise what's happened, particularly since COVID. COVID, [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3474.88s)]
*  like Jane Fonda said, was a great boon to the left. She saw that very early on and it allowed [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3479.28s)]
*  a lot of censorship initially about, you know, to save us our health because of COVID to stop [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3486.64s)]
*  naughty scientists like Jay Bhattacharya and Mani McKerry telling the truth about COVID, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3495.44s)]
*  that it wasn't actually as lethal as everyone said, and that masks made no difference and [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3501.12s)]
*  that the vaccine was not needed for young people and that it was probably bad for them. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3506.8799999999997s)]
*  So all of that censorship that worked so well when everyone was afraid, I think gave a green [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3513.28s)]
*  light to the bad guys in control, allowed them to see that, wow, we could do that in COVID, [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3521.76s)]
*  we can do whatever we like. And that's what's happened in Europe and Australia, you know, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3528.2400000000002s)]
*  England. And in America, we see it. The good thing is that it's sort of, they've tried to do it and [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3532.7200000000003s)]
*  they sort of succeeded. And I did the deep dive on the laptop. And so it happened there. And it [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3539.92s)]
*  happened with COVID. Even memes about Jill Biden were being censored. But because of Elon Musk, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3547.04s)]
*  because of the Twitter files, and because enough Americans have woken up and are just, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3553.84s)]
*  I don't know, in their DNA, they despise overlords. So they're rejecting it. And I think [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3560.56s)]
*  that's what this election is about. You know, you've got the untamable, uncontrollable Donald Trump [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3567.44s)]
*  versus just another cipher of the blob. One of the reasons this moment is so bewildering [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3573.44s)]
*  is because it's so confusing. What is going on? One of the reasons we're confused is because [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3580.32s)]
*  honest history is no longer taught in the United States, except in a few very small pockets. Unless [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3586.7200000000003s)]
*  you understand where ideas came from, why they were formed, why they're being spread, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3593.28s)]
*  what happened in the past, it's very hard to understand what's happening right in front of [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3598.8s)]
*  you in your own country today. We've thought a lot about this, the disappearance of honest history. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3602.6400000000003s)]
*  And we think we have found one place to find honest history to get actually educated about [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3609.52s)]
*  what you're seeing happen in the United States in 2024. The rot in our schools has blinded us [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3614.96s)]
*  to all of this. It all comes from a lack of education. And so we think we have an answer [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3622.64s)]
*  for that. And it's Hillsdale College. And Hillsdale College is an undergraduate institution. It offers [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3629.12s)]
*  graduate courses as well. But here's the point, it's accessible to you for free. You can get an [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3635.68s)]
*  education from Hillsdale for free. Go to tuckerfohillsdale.com and sign up. Again, costs [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3642.64s)]
*  you nothing. You can take online courses. Here's one that we strongly recommend. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3649.04s)]
*  It's called Marxism, Socialism and Communism. This doesn't cost you anything. It does not take a [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3653.36s)]
*  ton of time. It's six documentary style episodes. And it will help you understand what is happening [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3659.2s)]
*  to your country, because you'll understand where these ideas came from and what the plan is. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3666.0s)]
*  The class again is Marxism, Socialism and Communism. It's taught by Hillsdale College, [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3672.32s)]
*  and you can get it for free. Go to tuckerfohillsdale.com, tuckerfohillsdale.com, [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3677.12s)]
*  and get educated about your country. What happened to you in 2020 wouldn't have been possible [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3685.7599999999998s)]
*  now with an open X. No. So I do think Elon buying Twitter was a pivotal event in American history. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3691.7599999999998s)]
*  And I still don't understand why he did it. Why do you think he did it? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3700.72s)]
*  I kind of think it was a mistake in a way. He sort of said that. He sort of got, it was a spur of the [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3704.08s)]
*  moment whim. And then if he could have got out of it, he probably would have, because it's been a [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3710.7999999999997s)]
*  terrible burden for him. And he's now the target of so much sort of lawfare and deep state [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3715.04s)]
*  interference. And look, California has just stopped him from being able to set off some of [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3724.72s)]
*  his rockets. I mean, he's such a genius. NASA needed him to rescue our astronauts. That should [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3729.2s)]
*  have been a huge scandal that they had two astronauts up there just abandoned and they [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3735.4399999999996s)]
*  couldn't get them back. Elon's the only person who could get them back. He just had a rocket [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3740.3199999999997s)]
*  come back to earth when that never happened before and land back in the launcher or whatever it is. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3745.6s)]
*  I mean, he's just brilliant. And so they're trying to hobble him. He's hard to hobble, but I think [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3753.7599999999998s)]
*  he's public enemy number one next to Trump. I mean, as long as X is open, as long as you have [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3760.48s)]
*  truth telling or free speech at scale like that, it's pretty hard to turn your country totalitarian. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3767.8399999999997s)]
*  Yes. So can they, I mean, do you think the people, you know, the John Brennan's of the world, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3774.96s)]
*  the Barack Obama's of the world, people who do want to make it Stalinist, do people like that [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3780.08s)]
*  allow X to stay open? Well, see, what they've done, which is clever, is that only half the country [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3785.12s)]
*  is sort of, has been red-pilled and understands what's going on. And the other half of the country, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3792.96s)]
*  which is the well-educated part of the country that lives in Washington and, you know, New York and [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3799.12s)]
*  San Francisco and places and earn lots of money and think of themselves as being superior. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3805.68s)]
*  What's happened is that they've been pitted against these troglodytes of the right, you know, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3812.4s)]
*  the ultra-maga, the semi-fascist as Joe Biden called Trump supporters. And so Joe Biden did [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3818.24s)]
*  a very good job of dividing Americans against each other. And there really is now just an accepted [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3824.64s)]
*  view of half of America as that they're fat, that they're morally inferior, that really we'd be [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3832.56s)]
*  better off without them. They're morally inferior? 100%. So Epstein's clients are calling other [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3840.64s)]
*  people morally inferior. Exactly. Incredible. Do you know any of them? Any of the people you're [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3847.12s)]
*  describing? Well, I live among them. I mean, I live in Manhattan. So, I mean, I see them, I guess [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3853.36s)]
*  I'm not great friends with them, but they, I guess they're not our readers really. They're not [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3860.16s)]
*  necessarily New York Post. So is it your sense that they have no idea what's actually happening? [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3866.72s)]
*  No. They really didn't think Joe Biden had dementia before that debate? Well, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3874.16s)]
*  they really thought the COVID vaccine stopped COVID? Yeah, I do think that these people, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3878.96s)]
*  you know, they are so ignorant and naive. You see it when like Martha Raddatz interviewing JD Vance. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3885.4399999999996s)]
*  I think she genuinely thought to herself, what's a few apartment complexes, a handful of apartment [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3892.9599999999996s)]
*  complexes being taken over by Venezuelan gangs of illegal migrants? Big deal. I mean, she really, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3898.24s)]
*  that's the way they think. It's not that they're making it up. It's just that they live in this [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3904.3199999999997s)]
*  bubble because they didn't really know that there was an illegal migrant invasion going on [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3908.48s)]
*  because the New York Times and Washington Post never told them. And it's not in Bethesda, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3914.4s)]
*  should be in Bethesda. Yeah, it's creeping around. I mean, it's in New York. It's very hard to ignore [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3918.48s)]
*  it now in New York. But the clever thing they do about that is they conflate migrants. They just [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3924.8s)]
*  call them migrants so that it looks like Donald Trump is anti-immigration, which he's not. What he [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3931.44s)]
*  is is anti-illegal immigration. And when you have 10 to 15 million, maybe more, illegal migrants [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3939.36s)]
*  that you haven't vetted as Clinton just let the cat out of the bag the other day, come in to rape [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3945.6s)]
*  and murder and pillage and take over apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado. I mean, that's a [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3951.92s)]
*  huge problem. And that's something that the New York Times, the Washington Post kept from their [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3958.32s)]
*  readers. So while conservatives or Trump supporters, we know everything. We know reality [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3964.24s)]
*  because we know the real reality via X and sort of fringe conservative publications like the New [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3973.3599999999997s)]
*  York Post. But we also know their reality because it's forced on us. We have to live in their reality. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3980.08s)]
*  I mean, maybe not in northern Maine, but certainly if you live in New York or LA or anywhere, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3987.52s)]
*  Chicago, you are aware of the contempt with which these people hold conservatives and Trump [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=3994.72s)]
*  supporters. But they don't. They live in their bubble. They're not aware of reality like the [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4004.16s)]
*  migrant invasion. They're not really probably aware of Joe Biden's senility because [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4011.68s)]
*  when those videos are shown endlessly on Hannity, for instance, of Joe Biden bumbling around getting [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4018.96s)]
*  lost on a stage, all those things falling upstairs, they don't really see those. And they were [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4024.8799999999997s)]
*  trained into thinking that anyone who shows those, it's false. It's what was that fake word they had? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4031.04s)]
*  Like cheap fakes. So they're so naive and so propagandized, but the journalists themselves [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4037.44s)]
*  are. And you see the CNN panels now where this Kentucky Republican called Scott Jennings goes on [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4046.7200000000003s)]
*  and kind of red pills them. And they're all just astounded that he's telling them just these basic [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4054.56s)]
*  things that any normal person- Are happening in their country, but they have no sense of it [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4060.64s)]
*  because they're all in Newton Mass or Martha's Vineyard or whatever. And they only consume the [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4065.12s)]
*  media that propagandizes them and keeps them in the dark. So they're old and cut off. I mean, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4070.24s)]
*  they're what the hippies used to accuse their parents of being. They're totally out of touch. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4074.48s)]
*  They're just exactly living in a bubble. Wealthy. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing affects them. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4078.88s)]
*  But so why wouldn't, I mean, a fair country for Martha Raddatz to live in an MS-13 controlled [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4084.72s)]
*  housing project for a few years? Well, she probably will soon. I mean, that's what's going [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4091.44s)]
*  to, that's the effect of this invasion. Every single part of America eventually is going to be- [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4095.2000000000003s)]
*  Including all over the state of Maine for the record. Filled with African immigrants. Yeah, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4102.4800000000005s)]
*  filled. The cities are filled. Oh, absolutely. Makes sense. They've been flying- [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4107.68s)]
*  Immediately falling apart, displacing the people who were born there. Oh yeah. Landlords are paid [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4111.68s)]
*  to give preference to non-citizens from Africa over American citizens in housing. Not just public [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4117.2s)]
*  housing, but just any housing in the state of Maine. Yeah. And that's true in rural places [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4125.04s)]
*  around the country. The country is the worst thing that's ever happened in the United States, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4130.88s)]
*  including the Civil War. And people just are kind of ignoring it. Well, Springfield, Ohio, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4133.76s)]
*  that was the genius of Donald Trump. They're eating the cats, they're eating the pets. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4139.36s)]
*  And it became memes. And the fact checkers at Times and Washington Post were just very angry [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4144.88s)]
*  with him for telling lies. And they went searching for cats that were eaten and claimed they were [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4150.96s)]
*  none. But the brilliance of that one line was it just brought the focus on Springfield, Ohio, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4156.4s)]
*  and other towns like it that have been inundated secretly in the dead of night with plain loads of [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4164.48s)]
*  illegal migrants brought from the border. We tracked them into Westchester. We were pretty [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4171.28s)]
*  much the only media that were there at three in the morning at Westchester Airport watching these [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4177.5199999999995s)]
*  plain loads of illegals arrive and get put into buses that had their names blanked out and just [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4182.32s)]
*  driven off to the Tri-State area, dropped off at truck stops on the New Jersey turnpike and taken [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4188.96s)]
*  away by God knows who. And that was happening. That was the summer of 21. And that was happening [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4195.36s)]
*  all over the country and has been, Mallorcas has orchestrated this amazing kind of infiltration of [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4202.639999999999s)]
*  every corner of the country. You can almost see him with a map looking at like red areas and going, [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4209.44s)]
*  ha ha ha. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4214.88s)]
*  Literally facilitating the movement of human beings through the Darien Gap up through Latin [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4215.679999999999s)]
*  America in the United States. Mallorcas himself doing that. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4223.68s)]
*  And flying them in as well. So now they tell you, you can't say that they're illegal migrants. You [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4228.400000000001s)]
*  get fact checked to death. They are illegal, but it's just that they've been given this humanitarian [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4234.96s)]
*  parole that makes them, they can't be deported. So they're still illegal, but they're in this sort [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4241.360000000001s)]
*  of netherworld that the Biden administration has created so that they can pretend that the illegal [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4247.04s)]
*  migration invasion has sort of slowed down. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4252.96s)]
*  Yep. Total destruction of the country. It's hard to even think about it. It's so distressing. It [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4256.56s)]
*  was such a nice place. So how, okay, so Joe Biden, we're right in the middle of this. So it's hard [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4260.88s)]
*  to get perspective on Biden. And he's kind of fallen out of the headlines because the party [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4265.84s)]
*  decided that he was no longer useful and they replaced him. But how will history understand [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4271.76s)]
*  Biden, do you think? [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4277.6s)]
*  Well, I hope that the mythology that Joe Biden built for himself over 50 years is completely [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4278.8s)]
*  punctured. He did have like several of these pet historians used to come to the White House all [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4285.200000000001s)]
*  the time and whisper sweet nothings in his ear and tell him he was the second coming of FDR. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4291.76s)]
*  So they were- [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4296.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, whatever happened to, there was a kid from New, a kid, he's my age, who used to be the editor [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4297.200000000001s)]
*  of Newsweek, a particularly unctuous little toady from- [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4303.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, he's awful. Yeah, what's his name? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4306.8s)]
*  Tennessee. He's an Episcopalian. I know that I remember that because I am too. He's an awful [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4308.08s)]
*  little creepy guy. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4314.64s)]
*  Yeah, he's one of them. He's a speech writer. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4315.44s)]
*  That's exactly right. And he was a journalist. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4319.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4321.12s)]
*  Do you think, let me just pause really quick. Do you think when someone like that shows up to tell [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4325.12s)]
*  Joe Biden, who's effectively an intellectual invalid, that you are Pericles, you're Churchill, [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4329.12s)]
*  do you think they believe that? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4336.56s)]
*  No, but I mean, what access they have. They're just almost giddy. You see them on MSNBC. They're [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4338.4s)]
*  just giddy with their own self-importance because who gets invited like eight times to the White [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4344.0s)]
*  House? I think they go into his residence and he just loves it. Like, tell me more about myself and [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4350.4s)]
*  how consequential I am. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4355.92s)]
*  I don't know. I've been invited more than eight times to the White House. I've never [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4357.04s)]
*  kissed anybody's ass. I don't understand the impulse. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4360.8s)]
*  You're uncontrollable. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4364.0s)]
*  No, but I feel like I'm a pretty moderate, sensible person, but I don't know. I'm an [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4364.96s)]
*  adult man. I don't want to sniff any throne. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4369.28s)]
*  But you don't live on prestige. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4372.72s)]
*  No. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4373.28s)]
*  That's all they have. They want prestige. They want to be- [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4373.78s)]
*  It's so low. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4376.0s)]
*  Don't you think? [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4378.08s)]
*  Disgusting. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4378.88s)]
*  It's like, you've got children. What do they think of you? [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4379.38s)]
*  As you're telling Joe Biden, he's impressive. Like, how does your family respect you if you [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4382.0s)]
*  talk like that? I don't get it. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4387.2s)]
*  Well, they probably don't. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4390.24s)]
*  Well, I think that's probably right. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4391.28s)]
*  Sorry, I interrupted you. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4393.36s)]
*  Yeah. No, it's fascinating. They're gross, those historians. But [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4394.5599999999995s)]
*  I think ultimately that there is enough, you know, the Republicans, even though they're [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4403.04s)]
*  criticized- [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4408.0s)]
*  John Meacham is the name. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4408.24s)]
*  John Meacham, that's him. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4409.44s)]
*  The tiny little man in stature and spirit. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4411.839999999999s)]
*  He's the archetype. [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4415.2s)]
*  Yeah. It's just a perfect- and it's interesting. I remember I knew him sort of, because I think [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4415.28s)]
*  we're born the same year, 1969, I'm pretty sure. And I remember in the 90s being at some event, [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4421.44s)]
*  some party, Tina Brown's house in New York, and he was there. And he was like the editor of Newsweek. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4427.28s)]
*  And I remember thinking, wow, that's a pretty amazing job for a man who's not even 30. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4433.04s)]
*  Maybe 30. And then I realized over time, I spent more time with him, he just, [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4437.599999999999s)]
*  all he did was kiss ass. That's it. It was like his whole gig was just sucking up. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4444.719999999999s)]
*  And it's not good to have a system where that's rewarded. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4449.52s)]
*  He would have been in his element at a Tina Brown party in Manhattan. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4452.88s)]
*  I know. I shouldn't even- well, I mean, I was 29 myself. That's my excuse. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4455.84s)]
*  But Newsweek is not what it used to be. I mean, I think he presided over the fag end of it. I don't [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4460.4800000000005s)]
*  think, you know, they would have put anyone in there. And it wasn't as- it seemed prestigious [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4466.080000000001s)]
*  at the time, but it wasn't really a prestigious role. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4472.080000000001s)]
*  When you say he presided over the fag end of it, what do you mean? [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4474.0s)]
*  Just the end. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4478.8s)]
*  Just the end. Okay. Just the end. Sorry. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4479.92s)]
*  I'm not covering that. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4481.68s)]
*  So Biden, we had this period like maybe a year ago when people were telling us that Biden was [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4484.72s)]
*  a true statesman, probably the greatest president we ever had, sharpest attack. And then in one day, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4489.84s)]
*  back in June, it became clear that was all a lie and like this guy couldn't even find his way back [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4496.4800000000005s)]
*  to his bedroom. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4501.68s)]
*  Except when he could. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4502.400000000001s)]
*  Except when he could. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4504.080000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4506.0s)]
*  Let me ask you about that. What was that? I mean, do you- so we went in one day from, you know, [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4507.04s)]
*  having to listen to Morning Joe tell us how brilliant he was to Morning Joe admitting that he [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4512.32s)]
*  was demented. Was that a setup? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4516.719999999999s)]
*  I just think that when Pelosi and Schumer and whoever is behind things decided that he was a [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4521.36s)]
*  liability, Joe Biden, because he was not popular, he couldn't win the election, Trump was trouncing [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4529.12s)]
*  him in the polls. And he's just repellent. People got to know him and realized that the mythology [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4535.12s)]
*  of Joe Biden is honest Joe, middle-class Joe from Scranton. All of that was a lie. That he's [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4542.4s)]
*  actually an incredibly prideful, boastful, like pathological liar. I mean, we saw that with the [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4549.599999999999s)]
*  plagiarism, but also just those self-aggrandizing stories he tells all the time about. He's there [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4559.12s)]
*  with Nelson Mandela, like every big historic thing that happened, he's in the center of it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4564.48s)]
*  He's very much like Tim Walsh in that way. So people came to see that and see how ridiculous [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4569.839999999999s)]
*  he was. And also the worst, I think, was just how nasty he is. And I think, you know, he's lost that [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4575.5199999999995s)]
*  filter in his brain that stops him from publicly losing his temper. I'm sure at home he was [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4582.08s)]
*  losing his temper a lot with his, you know, and I think that's partly Hunter's problem. But [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4588.639999999999s)]
*  we saw that on stage and, you know, when he's wagging his finger and snarling about ultra-maga. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4594.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that's not very American. Americans seem to me to be very cordial, generous-spirited people. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4602.639999999999s)]
*  And I think that- [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4610.24s)]
*  Who have affection for each other. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4611.28s)]
*  Who have affection for each other. Yeah, very much so. And I think that congeniality to me is one of [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4612.959999999999s)]
*  the striking aspects of America that's quite different from other English-speaking countries [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4620.0s)]
*  I've been in. So Biden is sort of the opposite of that. He really is, although he's pitched as sort [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4625.6s)]
*  of Mr. America, I think he's very un-American in a lot of ways. And he is very admiring of people [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4636.0s)]
*  like Antony Blinken, you're a files. He's not like that. He's not well-educated, but he really [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4644.08s)]
*  admires those State Department types who, you know, are patrician and went to finishing school [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4649.6s)]
*  in Switzerland and- [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4656.4s)]
*  He does? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4657.68s)]
*  And went to school in, yeah, Antony Blinken, well, Antony Blinken went to school in Paris, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4658.4s)]
*  as we know. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4662.4s)]
*  Right, but he finds that impressive. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4663.2s)]
*  Oh, yes, very much. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4665.12s)]
*  Insecure son of a car dealer. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4667.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4669.12s)]
*  So easily won by dumb affectations, like, I mean, Blinken's like an idiot. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4669.68s)]
*  And look at the way he dresses. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4673.6s)]
*  Who? [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4675.52s)]
*  Joe Biden. Remember, Kitty Kelly did this incredibly insightful interview with the young [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4676.240000000001s)]
*  senator just after he came to Washington, just after his wife and baby daughter were killed in [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4682.56s)]
*  a car crash that Hunter was in and was injured in. And Joe Biden's there in his office, and she [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4689.92s)]
*  described him as dressing like the great Gatsby, like very elaborate, very expensive clothes, [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4696.08s)]
*  and boasting about his, like, sex life with his ex-wife, with his, sorry, his dead wife, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4702.64s)]
*  saying, you know, all the guys were jealous of me because we had the best sex. And then saying- [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4710.96s)]
*  Wait, he said that out loud? [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4717.28s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, you have to read this Kitty Kelly piece. It's so illuminating. I quoted huge [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4718.8s)]
*  chunks of it in laptop from Hell. It's brilliant. And then he talks about all these women are [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4724.64s)]
*  throwing themselves at him. And then he does this other boast because he grew up just admiring the [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4730.160000000001s)]
*  Kennedys, Catholics like him, Democrats. And he just, he tried to recreate the Kennedy compound. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4735.04s)]
*  He used to go to Nantucket rather than Martha's Vineyard. If you look at his political career, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4742.160000000001s)]
*  he's really modeled it very much on the Kennedy clan. And he wanted to have a, you know, the [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4748.8s)]
*  Kennedy kind of dynasty. So his son, Bo, was supposed to be the next generation. And sadly, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4754.72s)]
*  he died of brain cancer. But Joe Biden, I think just in that interview shows who he really is. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4760.96s)]
*  And it's quite a disgusting portrayal of himself. And he talks about the Kennedys and he says, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4769.28s)]
*  Rose Kennedy's calling me all the time inviting me for dinner, but I'm too busy. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4776.4s)]
*  That's just unbelievable. So it sounds like, I mean, you really spent a long time [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4783.04s)]
*  learning about reading about doing interviews about Joe Biden. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4788.08s)]
*  How does your view of him change the more you learned? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4792.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, initially, I used to like him because I thought, gosh, he's a moderate Democrat. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4795.599999999999s)]
*  He's a Democrat that I could live with. He's great. And I went full circle. I find him [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4800.72s)]
*  deeply dishonest, deeply flawed. I think he was a terrible father. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4809.200000000001s)]
*  You do? How? [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4814.400000000001s)]
*  Well, you see the product. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4816.320000000001s)]
*  And both his children, Hunter and Ashley, have proven like they admitted drug problems. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4820.160000000001s)]
*  And I think Hunter was a motherless boy. His mother had been killed. And Joe Biden had just [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4827.360000000001s)]
*  got this huge job in Washington, the opportunity of his lifetime. He wasn't going to give that up [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4835.52s)]
*  to stay home with these two motherless boys. So he went, he said, oh, I was going to, [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4840.08s)]
*  but then people talked me out of it. And so he goes to DC. He gets immediately adopted by all these [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4845.04s)]
*  grand poobars of the party because their wives were telling them, oh, this poor everyone, the [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4852.0s)]
*  whole of America, their heartstrings were tugged by this tragedy of this young widow. I mean, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4858.16s)]
*  it was a terrible tragedy, but Joe Biden exploited it in the most cynical fashion. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4863.28s)]
*  Just that photograph, which when I first saw it, I was like everyone else. Like I just felt [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4869.92s)]
*  desperately sad for these two little bandaged boys in the hospital bed in the foreground [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4874.16s)]
*  of the photographs where Joe Biden's being sworn in as Senator by their bedside, [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4879.92s)]
*  just after his wife's been killed. And you think to yourself, wow. But then when you see other [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4886.400000000001s)]
*  photographs pulled back and you see that hospital room is full of just dozens and dozens of [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4890.96s)]
*  photographers and reporters and everything, and the kids look quite distressed as they would be. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4897.360000000001s)]
*  And why did he do it there? Why didn't he get sworn in in the corridor outside, you know, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4902.8s)]
*  or somewhere else? He did it because he knew the power of that image and it was brilliant. [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4907.76s)]
*  And he used it in every campaign since. But it's cynical. And to be able to have the presence of [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4913.2s)]
*  mind to do that tells you a little bit about how ruthless he is and how fixated on power he is. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4919.52s)]
*  And I think that was, you know, I think that was the experience for Hunter. And you see that in a [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4926.400000000001s)]
*  lot of the private, you know, which I read, but I didn't publish a lot of it. But the musings, [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4933.36s)]
*  he's quite a good writer. He's highly intelligent, I think more intelligent than his father. At [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4940.24s)]
*  least he's not. I think Joe Biden's probably illiterate. I mean, from the little bit of writing [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4944.24s)]
*  that he's done on the laptop, he doesn't spell. He's got that trademark spelling problems that, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4949.5199999999995s)]
*  you know, boys who never learn to read have. And so I think Joe's probably cleverer than we think, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4956.32s)]
*  but he just is illiterate. Like he can't read very well. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4961.92s)]
*  Come on. Really? [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4965.92s)]
*  Yeah. I think that's why he has such a problem with, like the worst thing you could do to Joe [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4968.88s)]
*  Biden is put him in front of a teleprompter. And I think, yes, I mean, cognitively he slipped. But [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4973.2s)]
*  also I don't think he, like you notice when he comes across words that are long or complicated, [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4979.4400000000005s)]
*  or like people's surnames that you can't guess, he just can't do them. So, and you know, I mean, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4986.24s)]
*  I've done a lot of stories about phonics, you know, the failure of kids to be taught, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=4995.5199999999995s)]
*  especially boys, especially clever boys who they have dyslexia or something. It's really that a [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5001.84s)]
*  third of boys will never learn to read by that look and say that guessing way they have to be [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5007.92s)]
*  taught to sound things out by phonics. And I think when Joe Biden was being taught by the nuns, [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5014.0s)]
*  they just didn't teach him that way. So a lot of boys of his era slipped under the cracks. And so, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5020.16s)]
*  and I think he was clever enough to be able to get by by memory and cunning. He's renowned [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5026.24s)]
*  as not really reading his briefs. You know, he can be told something and remember it. But you look at [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5033.6s)]
*  him in those Senate hearings. He just fly by the, he just talks nonsense. In the text and emails on [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5040.72s)]
*  Hunter's laptop, how does he come across? How does he come across? There's not a lot of him. It's [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5047.6s)]
*  just a shadow of him. He cares about Hunter, but he cares about him. He's absent until he's about [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5054.08s)]
*  to announce that he's running for president. And then he really cares about Hunter, like where are [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5063.68s)]
*  you? We've got to get your drugs under control sort of thing. And dispatched his brother to go [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5067.44s)]
*  and put Hunter in rehab. And the reason Hunter was so angry in April of 2019 when he abandoned his [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5073.839999999999s)]
*  laptop was because he felt that his family, Joe, although he doesn't say it to Joe, threw him under [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5080.08s)]
*  the bus and he blames Joe's staff. But it was really Joe because there was a more endowed [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5088.16s)]
*  column that Hunter was particularly enraged about, which was basically saying that Joe Biden's [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5094.4s)]
*  running for president, but the big albatross around his neck is his loser son, Hunter, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5100.719999999999s)]
*  who's a drug addict. And Hunter was furious. And that's where all those texts and emails come out, [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5105.5199999999995s)]
*  that he says, you know, I've supported this family for years. I've given half my salary to dad, you [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5110.5599999999995s)]
*  know, how dare you all treat me with such disrespect. He was absolutely furious. And [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5117.52s)]
*  his relationship with his father is so complicated because he adores him as his only parent [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5125.280000000001s)]
*  after his mother was killed. But he also is like, he's just, he's hostage because there is no [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5135.040000000001s)]
*  mother, no somebody who loves you more than they love Joe, that loves the child. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5142.24s)]
*  And so he was sort of a victim of Joe Biden's selfishness and whims and the entire Biden [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5149.599999999999s)]
*  family. So Joe's sister, Val, moved in to take care of the boys after Joe left. Joe said he was [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5157.759999999999s)]
*  commuting every night from Washington on Amtrak, but I'm told that's not really true, that [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5164.56s)]
*  when he did come home, that the boys were already in bed. So maybe he had breakfast with them the [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5172.0s)]
*  next morning, but he wasn't a present dad, but Val was fantastic. His sister really sacrificed [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5176.160000000001s)]
*  her first marriage to look after those boys and Hunter regards her as his real mother. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5182.4800000000005s)]
*  And then Jill Biden comes into the picture a few years later and she's sort of the mean stepmother [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5190.08s)]
*  that Hunter doesn't get on with. Bo got on with her because Bo was the perfect child, golden-haired [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5195.92s)]
*  boy, but Hunter was like a little bit ADHD, a little bit rebellious, a bit naughty and used to [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5203.2s)]
*  get in trouble. And I think that didn't work with Jill. And so he and Jill had a difficult relationship. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5208.96s)]
*  And so I think Hunter loved his father, but also deeply resented him and resented the fact that [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5214.96s)]
*  Joe put Bo, the older brother, by one year and one day on a pedestal and saw Bo as being [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5225.12s)]
*  the inheritor of the Biden dynasty, political dynasty. And Hunter was sort of the spare [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5233.92s)]
*  that was supposed to go out and earn the money that would allow Joe and Bo to be clean politically. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5240.72s)]
*  So Hunter wanted to be an artist or a novelist and he's quite a good artist and quite a good writer, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5248.24s)]
*  but he wasn't allowed to. He had to go and work for his father's donors in Delaware in this really [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5255.36s)]
*  boring job at this credit card company and BNA for a hugely inflated salary that allowed him to pay [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5262.32s)]
*  off his Yale law school and Georgetown university fees, but also Bo's university tuition. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5268.8s)]
*  He paid off his brother's student loans? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5277.92s)]
*  Yeah. So Joe never had to put his hand in his pocket for anything. And that's where [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5279.68s)]
*  people miss the point of how Joe benefited. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5285.28s)]
*  That's amazing. Hunter Biden paid Bo's college tuition. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5289.6s)]
*  He complains about it to his Aunt Val. He said, Dad didn't pay a penny. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5294.0s)]
*  That's amazing. So he has every right to be resentful about that, I think. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5301.2s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5307.52s)]
*  So it's the youngest son's the workhorse paying for the pretty lavish [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5308.8s)]
*  lifestyles and political careers of his older brother and dad. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5315.36s)]
*  Exactly. And Joe knew that. And he knew that Hunter had at least a substance abuse problem. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5318.8s)]
*  That was evident. He was arrested at 18 for cocaine and let off. So he had this problem. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5326.72s)]
*  Joe knew about it. And yet Joe allowed him to take millions of dollars in unaccountable cash, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5333.52s)]
*  which was to a drug addict, just an impossible temptation. Hunter actually says that in his [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5341.52s)]
*  memoir, he says that the Burisma money when it was coming in, $83,000 a month, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5348.56s)]
*  that just sent him into a complete spin, fell off the wagon. And what kind of a loving father does [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5353.04s)]
*  that to his addicted son? [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5359.04s)]
*  My read on it is that Joe does love his son, but in a kind of... [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5363.28s)]
*  Narcissistic. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5367.36s)]
*  Yes. Infantile way, exactly. Narcissistic way, where it's all about the reflected glory of his son, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5368.24s)]
*  but not really about the son. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5374.16s)]
*  And that's hard if you're a sensitive person. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5376.8s)]
*  Well, it's awful. It's absolutely awful. And Hunter was a legit drug addict, [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5380.0s)]
*  tormented by the desire to be high all the time. And so what role does Dr. Jill play in all this? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5384.96s)]
*  Well, she seemed... Actually, in one way, I thought she was a bad wife, unlike Nancy Reagan, [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5395.04s)]
*  who was always at her husband's side to make sure that he didn't get humiliated. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5401.92s)]
*  I couldn't understand why Jill Biden wasn't there with Joe when he was getting lost on stage and [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5407.4400000000005s)]
*  just looking like a fool on camera. She should have been more present, but she wasn't in a lot [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5413.52s)]
*  of ways because she was out on the campaign trail herself. She was taking Air Force One to Paris and [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5418.4s)]
*  you know, just doing her own campaigning, supposedly campaigning, but she loved it. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5425.04s)]
*  I think she loves the glory. She's got this factotum working for her. Anthony, [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5431.759999999999s)]
*  can't remember his name. He's a sort of gay, one of those sort of men that attaches themselves to... [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5438.08s)]
*  He's sort of gay or pretty gay? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5446.32s)]
*  I think he's pretty gay. Yeah. And he's... But he's... Joe's everything. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5448.32s)]
*  She calls him her work husband and he's made himself invaluable to her. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5453.6s)]
*  Sounds totally healthy and normal. Your wife takes off for Paris and Air Force One with some [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5458.64s)]
*  gay dude while you're stumbling around lost on stage. Well, at least you know she's not [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5463.84s)]
*  having an affair with him. No, of course. Right. Every palace has eunuchs. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5467.68s)]
*  I think he's very powerful behind the scenes and he was involved at the very end when Joe was [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5473.360000000001s)]
*  trying to cling on to power. He and Hunter were there in the inner sanctum. And I think maybe he's [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5479.84s)]
*  part of the reason why Joe is such an LGBT champion, you know, partly to sort of curry [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5486.56s)]
*  favour with his wife's favourite person. It sounds like the sickest environment imaginable. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5495.6s)]
*  Like there are no healthy relationships. There's no honesty. There's no peace. I mean, that's what [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5501.84s)]
*  you're describing. Yeah, seems terribly unhealthy, terribly dysfunctional family, [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5508.0s)]
*  which is ironic because Joe's always created this mythology that so many people have bought, [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5512.64s)]
*  that they have got the closest family in the world, that he's the best father in the world. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5518.32s)]
*  And it's just this tragic circumstance that Hunter has a DNA predisposition to be a drug addict, [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5525.6s)]
*  nothing to do with his upbringing. And yet Donald Trump is treated like a complete monster. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5532.72s)]
*  Everything I've observed about his interactions with his adult children is positive. And his [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5539.84s)]
*  grandchildren, they adore him in a genuine way, not in a fearful, fake way. They really have a [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5544.240000000001s)]
*  good relationship. And I don't think people see that as much. I think the campaign is trying to [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5553.4400000000005s)]
*  show a few videos of the grandkids, but it just seems very natural to me, his interaction with [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5557.28s)]
*  his family. Did you, in all of your reporting on Biden, detect core beliefs? No, other than power [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5563.04s)]
*  for himself, self-aggrandizement, power, no core beliefs. He was adopted early on by the people who [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5572.24s)]
*  gave him his core beliefs. And that was that he was basically a warmonger. I mean, he was [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5581.12s)]
*  into enlarging NATO and being pugilistic about Yugoslavia. He wanted to bomb Yugoslavia. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5588.48s)]
*  And we did. I'm really glad we did. It was, I think, very important to kill all those people [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5598.32s)]
*  in Yugoslavia. Any idea why we did that? 30 years later, does anyone even remember that? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5602.72s)]
*  No idea. I bought the lies actually at the time. I never understood what they were. I was so confused [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5608.320000000001s)]
*  by that. Something about Slobodan Milosevic being bad. I remember George W. Bush always going about [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5614.400000000001s)]
*  Slobodan Milosevic, always mispronouncing his name. But I remember thinking, I'm sure he's bad, [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5619.04s)]
*  you know, foreign or whatever, but why was he bad? And why should I care? No one ever [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5624.4800000000005s)]
*  explained. What was that? Do we know? No, I don't know. I bought the same lies that everyone else [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5629.52s)]
*  did back then. I believed that he was the new Hitler. It's been a dreadful disaster. I mean, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5634.4s)]
*  it still is for that part of the world. And Joe Biden just wanted to bomb them. He was way out [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5642.32s)]
*  there and he'd go on NBC and so on and say, just bomb them all. That was what he was like. And [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5649.759999999999s)]
*  I don't think it was, I mean, he was just taking his marching orders and, or not his marching orders, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5655.2s)]
*  his agenda. And then he just like with everything and goes too far. But, you know, he's been at the [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5660.72s)]
*  centre of a lot of bad foreign policy for America from the beginning. And for a guy that's not very [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5666.0s)]
*  is ignorant really about the world, he's now put up as some sort of foreign policy guru. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5676.56s)]
*  Back in 2000, I think it was, he was instrumental in getting the World Trade Organization to [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5684.240000000001s)]
*  accept China, which was detrimental to America, hollowed out America's manufacturing and middle [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5690.56s)]
*  class. And that was something during the Clinton administration that Bill Clinton didn't want. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5696.88s)]
*  Republicans wanted it, but the Democrats, Joe Biden had to twist the arms of his [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5703.6s)]
*  Democrat colleagues in the Senate to get it over the line just and convince Bill Clinton. So. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5708.56s)]
*  But as Bush, you signed it. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5715.4400000000005s)]
*  Eventually 2000. Yeah. But that was done in the Clinton years and it was the [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5717.4400000000005s)]
*  Democrat senators that were instrumental in having, if they had stuck to their guns, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5724.400000000001s)]
*  that would never have been signed and China would never have been. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5730.72s)]
*  And Biden whipped that. He led the support for it. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5733.52s)]
*  Yeah. I never realised until I looked back at it and I thought, wow, interesting. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5736.160000000001s)]
*  So, and because I don't think my thesis is he doesn't have any core beliefs, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5740.240000000001s)]
*  then that must have been his sort of marching orders. I don't know if you call it marching [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5745.52s)]
*  orders, but the suggestions that the people who he owed his career to gave to him was, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5750.8s)]
*  we want China in the WTO. So he just goes about making it happen. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5757.280000000001s)]
*  He was very persuasive. I mean, he was very powerful in the Senate for many years, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5761.4400000000005s)]
*  which is a terrible indictment of the Senate. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5765.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, he's, there are a lot of people like that still in the Senate, you know, a lot. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5770.56s)]
*  Well, he was best friends with Mitch McConnell. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5774.88s)]
*  Well, I don't think his politics and Mitch McConnell's are identical. I mean, [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5777.12s)]
*  Mitch McConnell will be, and I think Mitch McConnell is slightly creepier, [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5780.16s)]
*  even than Biden in person, but- Is that possible? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5783.36s)]
*  I think Mitch McConnell is pretty darn creepy. Yeah. And even weirder person in life. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5786.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. He looks like a snapping turtle, not his fault. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5791.2s)]
*  I always liked him. He gave beautiful speeches. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5794.400000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's very smart. McConnell's legitimately smart. Oh, there's no doubt about it. And he's [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5797.84s)]
*  been great on a bunch of topics, but he's voting for Kamala Harris, there's no doubt in my mind. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5802.72s)]
*  Yeah. That's interesting that he was close to McConnell. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5807.68s)]
*  So you didn't really see any redeeming qualities to Biden's career? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5812.240000000001s)]
*  None. No, I think if he'd never existed, well, they would have found someone else. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5817.12s)]
*  That's the problem. I think he was the perfect cipher because he came in so young to the Senate. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5821.280000000001s)]
*  You know, he was 29 when he accidentally won against an old-time Republican in Delaware. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5827.92s)]
*  In fact, a guy called, his name was Caleb J. Boggs. And the irony is that when Hunter Biden [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5836.0s)]
*  went and was convicted in that gun trial, gun felony trial in June in Delaware, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5842.0s)]
*  it was done in the Caleb J. Boggs courthouse. Amazing. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5848.96s)]
*  So Boggs was a huge influence in Delaware. So it was really a David versus Goliath [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5854.8s)]
*  operation that Joe Biden just fluked by a few thousand votes. And the story that's told [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5863.68s)]
*  is that he did it because the Teamsters Union staged a strike of the trucks that were taking [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5870.8s)]
*  the newspaper out with Boggs the final weekend. Boggs had this huge double-page ad slamming [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5877.12s)]
*  Joe for some sort of corrupt dealings. And that was going to damage Joe and maybe would have swung [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5883.76s)]
*  the election. But the Teamsters successfully stopped those trucks with those newspapers going [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5889.4400000000005s)]
*  out. It's equivalent of the 2020 censorship. It's just thinking the exact same thing. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5894.96s)]
*  Right. So that's the 1972 version of taking the laptop story off social media. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5898.8s)]
*  Exactly. He's an expert at it. Amazing. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5904.400000000001s)]
*  Isn't it? So do you ever fear, you know, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5906.8s)]
*  when you and I are gone and our generation is gone that our great-grandchildren will be reading [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5913.2s)]
*  stories about what a hero Joe Biden is in their history books? [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5919.759999999999s)]
*  They probably will because especially I think part of the quid pro quo for him going quietly [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5924.48s)]
*  for Kamala was that he gets a presidential library. And you can imagine the sick of fancy [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5929.599999999999s)]
*  that's going to go on in that library about what a great man he is. So I think that. But I think [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5935.2s)]
*  there's enough on the public record, particularly James Comer, who gets trashed a lot because he [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5939.76s)]
*  didn't do enough, they say in the impeachment inquiry. But he actually managed to put on the [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5946.72s)]
*  record a lot of evidence to show that Joe Biden was involved in the family's influence peddling [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5951.52s)]
*  scheme, that this is where the money went, that there were two $250,000 checks, 10% of a couple [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5958.08s)]
*  of deals that Jim Biden and Hunter were involved in that went to Joe Biden that were the check [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5965.6s)]
*  memo says it was a loan repayment. And that's what Joe Biden maintains. And James Comer was never [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5971.52s)]
*  able to prove otherwise. So we have to give Joe Biden the benefit of the doubt there. However, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5979.120000000001s)]
*  it is part of a pattern of money, the money trail and how it gets to the Biden family, [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5985.4400000000005s)]
*  10% for the big guy, you know, that deal never happened. But I think it probably reflected the [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5991.76s)]
*  way Hunter's sort of businesses worked that Joe would get something. Hunter was certainly paying [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=5997.4400000000005s)]
*  for some of Joe's maintenance and upkeep on his Delaware estate. And Joe lives- [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6004.96s)]
*  And estate is not too strong. It was a former DuPont house, enormous house that Hunter grew up in. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6010.0s)]
*  Yes, with a ballroom. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6015.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And then I know from having friends and relatives in that town, Greenville, [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6016.88s)]
*  Delaware, that he never paid any of the workmen. You know, stiff, the firewood guy and the [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6022.64s)]
*  landscaper and the caterer and you know, they're always after him for money, really screwed the [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6027.84s)]
*  little guy consistently and was famous in the neighborhood for doing that. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6032.64s)]
*  It's incredible, isn't it? [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6035.68s)]
*  It is. Well, it is incredible. It's very low, the lowest. But how did he, I was wondering, [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6036.64s)]
*  how did he afford to live in a 12,000 square foot house on a Senate salary? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6041.04s)]
*  Well, he will tell you he was just lucky with real estate. And so all the way through, even became [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6046.08s)]
*  he's just the donors, you know, like he, they buy his houses [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6053.12s)]
*  for an inflated cost and he'd buy houses for a lower cost. Same with Hunter. Hunter bought [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6059.12s)]
*  places, same thing. And just, there was just a magic carpet ride for him. Whatever transaction [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6065.28s)]
*  that he entered into, he was looked after. And so the house he has now, he built from scratch, [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6072.72s)]
*  custom built, beautiful tradesmen from Philadelphia that built the best mansions. And it's, you [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6077.76s)]
*  remember when during the 2020 election, he was always mocked for being in his basement? Well, [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6085.12s)]
*  and you saw the basement a little bit. That basement is the most magnificent hand, custom [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6090.8s)]
*  built, wood paneled, mahogany, grand study library with books everywhere, pieces of [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6096.72s)]
*  historic furniture that he's bought from the White House. You know, he's, you could hear the honking [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6105.84s)]
*  geese outside in the lake because it's a lakefront property. He used to call it the lake house, but [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6113.76s)]
*  I think people teased him about it because it's a very small manmade pond really. So now he doesn't [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6117.84s)]
*  call it a lake anymore because, oh no, it's not a lake, it's just a pond. But gorgeous house and [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6124.24s)]
*  it's got a swimming pool and a boat jetty and a cottage for the secret service to stay in. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6129.04s)]
*  LESLIE It's all, what a poser. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6135.679999999999s)]
*  TAMARA What a poser? [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6138.32s)]
*  LESLIE What a hollow man. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6139.04s)]
*  TAMARA Absolutely. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6140.08s)]
*  LESLIE With massive social anxiety. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6140.96s)]
*  TAMARA That's the pathetic thing actually. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6143.84s)]
*  LESLIE Yes. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6146.5599999999995s)]
*  TAMARA It's quite, it's almost sad, but I mean, he's done so much damage to so many people, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6146.8s)]
*  I can't feel sorry for him. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6152.72s)]
*  LESLIE I love how resolute you are in your opinions of Joe Biden since you're one of the [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6154.0s)]
*  only people in America who has the right to those opinions because you know more than anybody about [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6158.240000000001s)]
*  Biden. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6162.88s)]
*  TAMARA Well, Hunter probably has more. But you know, being a son, you sort of brainwashed from a very [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6163.280000000001s)]
*  early age. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6168.8s)]
*  LESLIE It's hard. Yeah, and a child with one parent clings desperately to that parent no [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6169.12s)]
*  matter what the parent's like. That's just the way it is. What happens to Hunter? [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6173.76s)]
*  TAMARA Oh, he'll get pardoned. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6178.08s)]
*  LESLIE Okay, so he's been convicted on… [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6181.2s)]
*  TAMARA Gun felonies in Delaware, and also he pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6184.32s)]
*  in California in September to these various tax felonies, all of which, well certainly the tax [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6190.16s)]
*  felonies should carry a jail sentence. But he's to be sentenced on both of those after the election. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6196.799999999999s)]
*  And even though Joe Biden has said, oh no, I will never pardon my son, he said that once, [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6205.36s)]
*  and he didn't really say it very vigorously. He was just asked in a, I think a CBS interview, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6209.76s)]
*  and he said, will you pardon your son? He goes, no, and that was it. After that, the White House [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6215.84s)]
*  has been vigorous. They said, oh no, the President said he won't do it, he won't do it. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6221.2s)]
*  Have no doubt that he's going to pardon Hunter, you know, as anybody would. I mean, really, [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6224.88s)]

*  HENRY I'd pardon my son in a second. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6233.280000000001s)]
*  LORRAINE Of course, everybody would. And therefore, Joe Biden will get away with it. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6237.2s)]
*  Like everyone will say, the media will say, oh, you know, it's his only surviving son, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6241.28s)]
*  how can you blame him? If anyone criticizes it, they'll be called cruel and heartless. So, of course. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6246.72s)]
*  HENRY So Joe Biden's going to get away with it. I mean, [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6252.64s)]
*  probably not for eternity will he get away with it, but for the here and now, he's getting away with it. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6256.72s)]
*  LORRAINE Yeah. But I think his reputation has been damaged, and now people know [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6260.88s)]
*  well, the evidence is there for people to know the truth about Joe Biden. And any honest historian [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6266.96s)]
*  is going to include the fact that he really sold out the country. And you can look at his presidency [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6271.92s)]
*  and his attitude towards China and how he unwound a lot of the Trump era, get tough on China policies, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6280.4s)]
*  some of them inexplicable. Like for instance, even Christopher Wray, the FBI director, has [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6288.24s)]
*  complained bitterly about the fact that Biden dismantled this very good program in the universities [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6294.64s)]
*  that was supposed to stop China stealing American intellectual property, spying on [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6300.88s)]
*  our academic institutions. HENRY Yeah, and the research universities. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6307.6s)]
*  LORRAINE Yeah. And I mean, there have been academics that have gone to jail [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6311.200000000001s)]
*  through this program and been busted, and Chinese spying rings have been busted. And for some unknown [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6314.96s)]
*  reason, there was nothing positive for America about dismantling it. Joe Biden quietly dismantled [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6320.96s)]
*  it. HENRY It's bizarre. And it was defensive, not offensive. We were trying to protect ourselves [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6327.2s)]
*  from the theft of research. LORRAINE 100%. And I've asked why, what possible justification is that? [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6333.92s)]
*  And they said, oh, it was racist, because it was targeting Chinese. HENRY Really? It's racist? [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6339.12s)]
*  LORRAINE Yeah. Just like calling the Wuhan virus saying it came from China was racist. It wasn't. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6345.92s)]
*  But that's what they tagged Donald Trump with. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6352.64s)]
*  HENRY Just to that without getting again to sidetracked, but really quickly, [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6355.28s)]
*  it seems like that virus was created in the Wuhan lab in part with US tax dollars. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6360.88s)]
*  LORRAINE Oh, yes. I mean, I think I don't know that it was deliberately released at all. I think [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6365.52s)]
*  that was an accident. But 100%, EcoHealth Alliance, run by this absolutely repellent [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6370.56s)]
*  man, Englishman called Peter Dazic, he ran this weird little company that has an office in Manhattan, [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6377.76s)]
*  but really does no research of its own. But it gets these massive grants from DARPA, which is [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6386.080000000001s)]
*  basically an arm of the Department of Defense. And that's what it lived on. And what he did, [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6392.080000000001s)]
*  EcoHealth Alliance, with the help of Anthony Fauci, was bypass the Obama-era moratorium on [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6401.4400000000005s)]
*  gain of function, that Frankenstein research on viruses. And he funneled basically this DARPA money, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6408.4800000000005s)]
*  US taxpayer money, through to the Wuhan Institute of Health, where he co-authored some papers, [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6416.8s)]
*  even though he's an idiot, but he co-authored papers with the Bat Lady there, the scientist. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6422.96s)]
*  And all these fantastic whistleblowers who've come out from the scientific community have [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6428.8s)]
*  pinpointed that the work that they did on the viruses where they used humanized mice to make [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6435.04s)]
*  the virus more lethal to humans, that was all occurring in that lab. And it was a very low [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6443.84s)]
*  security bio lab. Unlike if that kind of research is done in America, it would have been done at a [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6452.08s)]
*  higher level, even though there's still the risk of leakage. But in that Wuhan lab, of course, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6457.92s)]
*  it was going to leak. And so it was just a disaster waiting to happen. And it was done because [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6462.64s)]
*  Anthony Fauci was so antagonistic to the group of scientists who were sounding the alarm about gain [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6468.8s)]
*  of function research. Anthony Fauci loves gain of function research. He thought that was going to [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6476.64s)]
*  make him immortal, that they were going to find the vaccine for viruses. There are photographs [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6481.44s)]
*  of him with DASIC, there are emails that have been uncovered of him with DASIC. It was obviously a [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6489.5199999999995s)]
*  subservient relationship on DASIC's part. He worshipped Fauci, but Fauci was friendly with him. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6496.16s)]
*  And Fauci says he doesn't know anything about these DARPA grants, but someone who used to work [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6502.08s)]
*  with DASIC at EcoHealth Alliance and left sort of under a cloud, he's become a form of a whistleblower. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6511.52s)]
*  I've talked to him a little bit, I'm not 100% certain of how valid he is. But this is what he [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6518.8s)]
*  says. He says that the CIA approached Peter DASIC about sort of helping them because he was so [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6524.32s)]
*  embedded with the Chinese. And the Wuhan lab apparently was some sort of military [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6532.96s)]
*  research was going on there. So you could understand the CIA wants to have some sort of eyes [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6537.5199999999995s)]
*  and ears and DASIC would have been useful. So while this whistleblower didn't personally see [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6544.16s)]
*  the CIA approach, DASIC asked him about it a couple of times. And the whistleblower believes [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6550.0s)]
*  that DASIC did end up working sort of as an informant for the CIA. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6556.48s)]
*  Amazing. And I'm sure we'll never know, you know, the truth about a lot of what you just said. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6560.72s)]
*  But what we do know, I think conclusively is that it came from that lab, it was loosed on the world, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6567.2s)]
*  and as the Biden administration never ceased telling us, millions died. So whether it was [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6572.320000000001s)]
*  intentional, or I would think I agree with you, probably more likely it was accidental, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6577.76s)]
*  either way it happened because of something that China did. How come the Biden administration has [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6581.360000000001s)]
*  never pushed China to pay reparations to the United States or any other country for [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6586.16s)]
*  what that virus did? Well, I can only assume it's because they know that they are complicit, [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6589.36s)]
*  and that as long as they don't push China too hard, President Xi is not going to say, well, hey, [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6595.92s)]
*  you know, it was your Pentagon money that paid for this research, and it was your Peter DASIC, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6601.04s)]
*  friend of Anthony Fauci, who encouraged the Bat Lady to do that particular research. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6608.8s)]
*  So I think it's mutually assured destruction, like they both just don't say anything, and it goes away. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6614.4800000000005s)]
*  And I'm sure that's in part why Donald Trump's administration didn't really push that hard, [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6620.72s)]
*  and because it's the same people in charge at the CIA and the State Department and the Pentagon who [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6626.8s)]
*  know that they didn't deliberately do this, but it was their incompetence, their own, you know, [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6632.8s)]
*  incompetence, sloppiness, whatever, recklessness that unleashed this virus on the world. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6642.8s)]
*  And America doesn't want to have its fingerprints on it, and I think the fingerprints are there. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6650.24s)]
*  We've seen enough already has, you know, in Congress, there have been some good politicians [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6654.24s)]
*  who've pushed on this, and there's been enough FOI material that's come out to show that there [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6662.56s)]
*  was certainly eco-health was being funded. So you know, it doesn't take much to follow the trail. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6669.76s)]
*  Plus, Peter DASIC is so protected. I mean, where he lives sort of in the woods, [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6674.08s)]
*  just outside of New York, any reporters who go there, immediately the cops are there, like [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6681.2s)]
*  they're protecting him. He's been... [[01:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6687.52s)]
*  Really? I wish I had... [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6691.360000000001s)]
*  He has a high level of protection. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6692.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. No, you won't get that. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6693.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah, I've noticed. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6695.52s)]
*  You're the enemy. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6696.4800000000005s)]
*  So, okay, since you have... This is my last question, but since you've got such an amazing [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6698.08s)]
*  recall, a remarkable memory for details and people, I've really known very few people with [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6702.48s)]
*  recall like yours. I just... One more thread I'd like to sort of tie into a bow, and that's the [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6708.16s)]
*  whistleblowers who did business with Hunter Biden. What happened to them? So that would be [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6714.72s)]
*  Tony Bobulinski and Devin Archer. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6721.04s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, they're really the heroes of this story. Tony Bobulinski was working with Hunter [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6724.64s)]
*  on the last, the big China deal that ended up falling over. Hunter and his uncle Jim Biden [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6731.6s)]
*  got, I think, about $20 million out of that deal after they sort of shafted Bobulinski and their [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6740.08s)]
*  other partners, basically for doing nothing. But Bobulinski is sort of a self-made man, [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6746.0s)]
*  and so he's quite protected. Like, he has his own money. He doesn't owe anything to anybody. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6752.8s)]
*  He's a former naval nuclear rocket instructor, nuclear submarine instructor. He's a pretty tough [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6758.96s)]
*  guy, and he knows a lot of tough guys who protect him. So I think he's been okay. Devin Archer, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6767.04s)]
*  on the other hand, he's a lovely man, and I've got to know both of them, and I call them friends now. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6774.320000000001s)]
*  They've become friends. They have this beautiful bromance. They never knew each other before, [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6780.64s)]
*  and now they're just rock-solid friends because they've suffered both of them at the hands of [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6784.64s)]
*  the Bidens. Devin more so because he was Hunter's best friend. They met at Yale. Hunter called him [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6789.52s)]
*  my best friend in business. They went into business together. Devin did all the work, [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6797.360000000001s)]
*  and Hunter was sort of brought in as sort of the Biden name. In the end, they did a deal [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6804.08s)]
*  that went sour, and the Southern District of New York charged Devin with fraud over that deal. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6811.12s)]
*  Hunter was deemed not to have been involved. Even though Hunter was, I think, Vice Chairman [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6818.72s)]
*  of the company, he'd earned $200,000. Devin had lost millions of dollars. Devin was the one who [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6824.4s)]
*  ended up basically going to trial. He was convicted and then acquitted, or the conviction was [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6831.36s)]
*  overturned by the judge who found that he was honest and found that he'd been unjustly treated. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6842.639999999999s)]
*  He's been going through, I think, about eight years of sheer hell where he hasn't been able [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6850.719999999999s)]
*  to earn money. He has a close family, so that's supported him. He's remained remarkably optimistic, [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6855.68s)]
*  but he's facing jail. I mean, he could go to jail, I think, for a year and one day. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6862.4800000000005s)]
*  That's while Hunter Biden has escaped scot-free. With everything that Hunter's done, there's always [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6869.360000000001s)]
*  been this invisible hand that's reached out and rescued him from peril, while all around him, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6876.0s)]
*  all his business partners went broke, went to jail, died, disappeared. Hunter just is like [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6882.72s)]
*  the character in a disaster movie where all the cards blow up and this one man runs through the [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6889.52s)]
*  flames. He's the road runner. You do get the sense he's not going to escape, though. I mean, [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6895.68s)]
*  he must be in rough shape. I haven't seen him in a while, a long while, but he must be in rough [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6903.12s)]
*  shape. You can't put yourself through that kind of life without destroying a lot of your brain. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6907.52s)]
*  Yeah, I would say, I guess. I mean, look, I wish nothing but the best for him. I've actually come [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6914.160000000001s)]
*  to... I never met him. I would have loved to interview him. I still would love to interview him, [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6919.68s)]
*  but I know people around him. I mean, all the people around him were fantastic people, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6924.320000000001s)]
*  like his friends. I've met quite a few of his friends. Kevin Morris, everyone hates Kevin [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6929.4400000000005s)]
*  Morris, but he's not a bad guy either. The Hollywood lawyer, his sugar brother who's funded [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6935.04s)]
*  like his lifestyle and paid all his IRS debts. All these people, they have a good heart because [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6939.5199999999995s)]
*  they get sucked in by Hunter because Hunter does have that tragic quality. Women especially rally [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6945.68s)]
*  around him and want to mother him and protect him and forgive him all sorts of atrocities. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6952.48s)]
*  I think men, it's the same thing. Everyone you talk to say he's just good. Hunter is so charming [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6958.08s)]
*  and lovable and vulnerable. And not stupid. No, smart. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6964.32s)]
*  Sad. So you count him a victim of his father's. Oh, yes, 100%. I mean, he's a victimizer as well [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6970.0s)]
*  as all victims like that are, but I mean, he's victimized. I sat in the courtroom in Delaware [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6976.16s)]
*  and watched his two exes, Hallie Biden, who was his brother, Bo's widow that he took up with, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6982.0s)]
*  had a torrid affair with and put her on to crack. And she's pretty broken. His ex-wife Kathleen, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6989.2s)]
*  who I never met her. I mean, I saw her in court. She looked like a broken woman, really very [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=6998.8s)]
*  different from the Kathleen that was in all the photographs. She came across in the laptop, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7004.24s)]
*  in all the writings as kind of naive, very loving. Like she adored Hunter, absolutely adored him, [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7010.16s)]
*  forgave so much. And then the bitterness that crept in, I mean, it was nothing like what I would [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7017.76s)]
*  be like. She was still quite kind towards him. You know, he did terrible things, he betrayed her in [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7023.2s)]
*  the worst way, but she, and it damaged her inside, but she maintained a sort of a civil relationship [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7029.84s)]
*  with him, I guess, for the sake of their daughters. And she's a good mother. So he had a knack for [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7037.4400000000005s)]
*  finding these great women that looked after him, forgave him. And all destroyed in the end. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7044.08s)]
*  Yeah, all destroyed. Although Hallie's remarried, so I think she's a survivor. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7051.2s)]
*  She's remarried a rich guy in Ohio, apparently. So she was looking quite happy, had a huge [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7056.0s)]
*  rock on her hand. So I think she'll be okay. I just want at least one person to come out happy. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7062.08s)]
*  Randa Devine, congrats on the book. Thank you. Thank you so much. It was great to see you. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7068.0s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. I know. Shocking that in an election year, [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7076.96s)]
*  with everything at stake, Google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7084.56s)]
*  hearing anything that the people in charge don't want you to hear. But it turns out it's happening. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7089.92s)]
*  So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. Not in [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7094.96s)]
*  charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it. A way that you could actually get information [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7099.04s)]
*  that's true. It's not intentionally deceptive. And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7104.4800000000005s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, and you'll have a much higher chance of hearing what [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7110.0s)]
*  we say. And we hope you will. One of the things we wanted to do when we left conventional media [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7116.32s)]
*  television news was not simply to augment or add to traditional media, but to replace it. Because [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7122.96s)]
*  it's so rotten. It's so deceitful. It's so repellent that it needs to be replaced. And we want to be [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7131.04s)]
*  part of what replaces it at TCN. And so to that end, we produced a lot of news content from a [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7138.64s)]
*  bunch of different countries, but we're also producing long form content, documentaries. [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7144.4s)]
*  We have 13 separate documentaries coming out between now and right after the election. That [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7149.44s)]
*  would include more episodes of Art of the Surge, which is the account, almost live account, of what [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7155.599999999999s)]
*  it's like behind the scenes on the Trump campaign. Line in the Sand, James O'Keeffe's latest [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7161.2s)]
*  documentary on the immigration crisis, where he rides a train with the drug cartels north as they [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7165.2s)]
*  smuggle human beings into the United States. And All the President's Men, which is a six part series [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7171.12s)]
*  by our friend Sean Stone on the deep states war on Donald Trump and the people around Donald Trump. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7175.76s)]
*  All of that dropping in the next month and all of it available on TCN. So go to tuckercarlson.com [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7182.0s)]
*  to see 13 new documentaries in the next month and many more to come after that. [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7188.88s)]
*  Tucker Carlson.com is where all of it lives and will live going forward. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXMqVha_a4o&t=7194.64s)]
