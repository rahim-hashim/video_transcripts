# Dave Smith Tim Walz, Trump vs. Rogan, and Who Is Really Running the Country?
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [August 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I)
*  My memory is fading. When were you here last? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, I like to measure it in coups and assassination attempts. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2.56s)]
*  So I was here one coup and one assassination attempt. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6.88s)]
*  Oh, go. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=9.68s)]
*  So now it's the first week of, second week of August, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=30.96s)]
*  and it feels like a different country. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=34.72s)]
*  Yeah. Isn't that something? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=37.84s)]
*  Yeah. What's happened between May and now? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=38.96s)]
*  An assassination attempt and a coup. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=43.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=45.2s)]
*  That's for one. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=45.36s)]
*  Olympics. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=47.28s)]
*  So basically the busiest period in American history, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=47.84s)]
*  but we just sort of kind of forgot it all happened or something. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=50.08s)]
*  It is really amazing. It is really, it's unbelievable. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=52.32s)]
*  And I think that like both me and you, when, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=55.28s)]
*  when I interviewed you on my podcast, which I don't remember when that was, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=57.44s)]
*  but it was several months before I came out here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  And we were both kind of talking about how, you know, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=63.68s)]
*  trying to make predictions about the rest of 2024 is difficult. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=66.4s)]
*  But the one thing you know is it's going to be crazy. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=70.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  Like it's going to be something really wild. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=73.36s)]
*  You could just feel that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=75.12s)]
*  And at this point, you're like, how do we even accelerate from here? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=76.88s)]
*  And I think we're going to, by the way, I don't, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=81.52s)]
*  I think we've got several more crazy things to go before November. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=83.12s)]
*  So to the extent you can predict them, what do you foresee? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=86.96s)]
*  It's so hard right now. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=89.6s)]
*  I mean, I really have a tough time because this, I did not see this coming. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  I didn't see Kamala Harris being the person. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  It was always everyone who was speculating about. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=100.8s)]
*  No chance. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  She's too dumb. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  She's too unpopular. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=105.6s)]
*  We were like, who's it going to be? Gavin Newsom or Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=106.88s)]
*  And everybody, even in the corporate media, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=110.72s)]
*  in the moment when they admitted the emperor was naked after that debate, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=113.44s)]
*  even all of them were speculating about who the person. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=119.12s)]
*  Yeah, right. Exactly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=121.52s)]
*  Even all of them were speculating about who it would be if Joe Biden dropped out. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=123.12s)]
*  And Kamala Harris was not the person because she's so, I mean, awful at this and deeply unpopular. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=128.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=133.68s)]
*  And so now they've switched into a new emperor's new clothes mode [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=134.16s)]
*  where there is this totally astroturfed fake, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=138.64s)]
*  Kamala Harris went from being the most unpopular vice president ever to a cultural phenomenon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=142.56s)]
*  The one thing this nation needed was more Kamala Harris. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=147.76s)]
*  It's just, it's very bizarre to watch it. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=151.04s)]
*  I said this last time we were here that I always, I like to call them storms. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=153.35999999999999s)]
*  Like when you're in the middle of a massive propaganda storm. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=157.76s)]
*  I always love the example. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=160.56s)]
*  And I mentioned this last time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=162.0s)]
*  I don't know why I just, this example, when Donald Trump said he was going to pull out of Syria, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=163.28s)]
*  which he ultimately backed down on and didn't do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=167.68s)]
*  And for two weeks in the media, it was the Kurds. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=170.32s)]
*  What about the Kurds? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=173.44s)]
*  Our historic allies, the Kurds. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  Yes, the Kurds. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  We never betrayed the Kurds before and we'll never do it again. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=176.32s)]
*  My grandfather said to me on his deathbed in 1983, he goes, grandson, don't betray the Kurds. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=179.12s)]
*  And then it's like ever since then, no one's mentioned the Kurds. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  But do fight the Houthis. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=187.04s)]
*  Yeah, right, right. That's right. It's so important. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=188.16s)]
*  But it's all, but there's like these weird propaganda storms. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=190.16s)]
*  There's no, there's no energy to that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=199.76s)]
*  It's not risking anything. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=210.64s)]
*  It's not like, oh my God, my channel is going to get banned for saying a couple of years ago. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=211.76s)]
*  That was a really risky thing to say. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=215.28s)]
*  Oh, I lived it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=216.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, because you know, you were in that storm. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=217.6s)]
*  So the storm right now is that Kamala Harris has this massive grassroots support. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=220.56s)]
*  That's why when she ran for president in 2019, she had to drop out before Iowa. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=226.96s)]
*  How many delegates did she get that year? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=232.72s)]
*  It'll take us the whole show to count them up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=235.28s)]
*  But like, come on. I mean, look, however you feel about people, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=238.08s)]
*  there's people I despise politically. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=240.88s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=242.4s)]
*  I cannot stand Bernie Sanders politically. I hate socialism or whatever he is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  He's not exactly a socialist, but whatever he is, I hate it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=248.08s)]
*  But he had real grassroots support. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=251.12s)]
*  For real. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=252.88s)]
*  For real. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=253.36s)]
*  That's why they had to steal it from him. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=253.68s)]
*  Yes, exactly. Tens of millions of Americans were Bernie Sanders. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=254.72s)]
*  Donald Trump, however you feel about him, has real grassroots support. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=258.88s)]
*  Barack Obama, however you feel about him, had real grassroots support. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=261.92s)]
*  You know what they all have in common? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=264.88s)]
*  They didn't drop out before Iowa because nobody with real grassroots support [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=266.4s)]
*  doesn't make it to the first contest. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=270.96s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, it's not as if she was a Bernie Sanders or say like a Ron Paul or a Dennis Kucenich. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=273.36s)]
*  She had major donors behind her. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=280.08s)]
*  She took much of the Clinton campaign. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=282.8s)]
*  She was touted by the corporate media as like the candidate when she first announced in 2019. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=285.92s)]
*  And still with all that, couldn't get to Iowa. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=291.68s)]
*  So in other words, I think the whole Kamala Harris thing is fake. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=294.16s)]
*  It's all astroturfed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=299.12s)]
*  I think if there was a real election today, I don't see how she could beat Donald Trump. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  But all of that, you know, is a... [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=305.92s)]
*  So maybe the... [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=308.72s)]
*  We don't know that that's going to happen. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=310.16s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=311.92s)]
*  Of course that's not going to happen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=312.56s)]
*  But I wonder though if the lesson is... [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=313.52s)]
*  Maybe we've been taken in by this illusion that it's about people [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=315.6s)]
*  when really it's about machines. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=319.28s)]
*  The machinery of the party system, particularly the Democratic Party. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=320.64s)]
*  And it just kind of doesn't matter what Kamala Harris is like, what her record is, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=324.32s)]
*  what she believes, what she'll do or not do. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=327.68s)]
*  She has no role in any of that. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=330.08s)]
*  She's just a stand in for the oligarchy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=331.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=335.52s)]
*  I mean, we're going to... [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  It does feel that way though. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=337.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=338.4s)]
*  Well, it's an interesting... [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=338.64s)]
*  We're kind of running that experiment right now to see how fake it is or how little the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=339.6s)]
*  people actually matter. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=345.6s)]
*  I will say, at least with Joe Biden, they proved they couldn't do it with him. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  Like he was too senile to be able to pull that off. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=356.8s)]
*  Just like everything, right? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Just like the US Empire, governments in general, they're not gods. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  There are limits to their power. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  Their question is like, can they pull this off? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=369.6s)]
*  It's interesting to me. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=371.92s)]
*  That is a really smart point. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm glad that you said that because it actually makes me feel better. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=375.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=379.36s)]
*  Well, that's... [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=379.6s)]
*  We still have a shot. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=380.16s)]
*  There are limits. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=380.72s)]
*  They're not omnipotent. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=381.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=382.40000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=382.64000000000004s)]
*  Well, I mean, look, there's lots of examples of that, like every foreign policy decision [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  in the last 20 plus years. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=388.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=390.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=390.8s)]
*  They actually can't do everything. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=391.04s)]
*  They think that we can do a lot. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=392.72s)]
*  I mean, we can take down nations. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=394.32000000000005s)]
*  We can't build them. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=396.64000000000004s)]
*  We've learned that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=398.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=398.8s)]
*  But with Joe Biden, there was a really weird mix of things that happened. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=399.92s)]
*  And one of them is that there is a kernel of truth, just a kernel of truth to the corporate [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=405.68s)]
*  media narrative, which is that obviously, like me and you were talking, I think at least [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  since 2019 about Joe Biden's very obvious cognitive decline. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=418.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  It was very clear when he came back around after being vice president. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=423.92s)]
*  If you listen to him back in 2016, when he made the decision not to run, he said it was [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=428.24s)]
*  because he wasn't over his son dying or whatever. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=435.04s)]
*  But we know it was really because Obama pushed him out in favor of Clinton, even though it [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  was kind of his turn. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=442.0s)]
*  Traditionally speaking, he was the vice president. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  But back then, he kind of was Joe Biden. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=446.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=449.6s)]
*  And then once he came back around running in 2019, it was like, whoa, this isn't Joe [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=450.0s)]
*  Biden anymore. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=454.64s)]
*  But the kernel of truth to the media narrative is that it's also true that it got [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=455.6s)]
*  drastically worse. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=459.92s)]
*  Whatever it was, it went from being a thing where, I mean, I remember on your Fox show [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=462.40000000000003s)]
*  in 2019, you'd be like playing these clips of him where he'd go, he'd get the state wrong. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=467.04s)]
*  He was telling these weird stories. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=472.48s)]
*  It was transparent to me. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=474.88s)]
*  It was very clear. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=476.08000000000004s)]
*  But he was still a little bit hit or miss. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  He'd have one speech where he kind of was OK. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=480.16s)]
*  Then the next speech, he looks like he has dementia. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=482.88s)]
*  Whatever Joe Biden showed up and he did the debate with one or two debates in 2020. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=486.8s)]
*  Did they do two? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=493.52000000000004s)]
*  I can't remember. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=494.40000000000003s)]
*  But he got through them. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=495.44s)]
*  I mean, Trump kind of talked over it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=496.72s)]
*  Trump made a real tactical error and just dominated. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  Whereas you want to let Joe Biden talk. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  As we learned. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=502.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=503.68s)]
*  The muting the microphones really worked in Trump's favor in that debate. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=504.24s)]
*  But lately, it's not like every other speech. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=509.12s)]
*  No. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=513.6s)]
*  He's bad. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=513.84s)]
*  He can't pull off one. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  He can't pull off any interview. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=515.52s)]
*  Is he still the president? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=517.36s)]
*  Who is the president of the United States? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=518.4s)]
*  Yes, we don't have one. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=521.68s)]
*  How strange is that? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=524.08s)]
*  This is what's crazy to me though, right? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=526.0s)]
*  So if you look at, first of all, the distinction, which I think should be obvious more and more [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=529.04s)]
*  to people is that the distinction politically that matters right now is not left versus right. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=534.4s)]
*  That is just not true. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=541.04s)]
*  It's one thing that, man, it drives me crazy amongst Republican voters and even Republican [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=542.56s)]
*  leaders that they still want to see things in that distinction. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=549.04s)]
*  They still want to go the far left Nancy Pelosi or whatever. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=552.24s)]
*  It's like, yeah, she's not really far left. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=555.28s)]
*  She uses far left language. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=557.76s)]
*  But these people, it's not calling Kamala Harris a communist or whatever. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=560.16s)]
*  I know people were sending this clip. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=565.28s)]
*  These are people who work for JP Morgan. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=567.68s)]
*  Yes, they're not communist. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  They're for big business. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=570.8s)]
*  They're like, yeah, but look at this clip. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=572.4s)]
*  She's talking about equality of outcomes. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=573.4399999999999s)]
*  She doesn't even understand what that means. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=575.52s)]
*  It's not really communist. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=577.36s)]
*  They're using leftist language. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=578.72s)]
*  They're liberal. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=580.64s)]
*  They're neoliberals who are for big business. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=581.28s)]
*  So the distinction is not left or right. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=584.24s)]
*  The distinction is like establishment versus dissident or corrupt versus honest or something [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=586.24s)]
*  like that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=594.08s)]
*  That's why Glenn Greenwald is not on the opposition team to us and Mitch McConnell is our ally. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=595.28s)]
*  It's not about that. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=602.8s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=605.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=606.72s)]
*  So one of the things that the establishment has, which is really something I've been marveling at [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=607.28s)]
*  lately, is they have unbelievable message discipline, something that us, the dissidents [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=612.24s)]
*  could never dream of having. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=620.96s)]
*  I mean, it's just unbelievable. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=622.48s)]
*  You see some of the compilations of the corporate media. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=623.84s)]
*  It's just like, hey, JD Vance is weird. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  That's the line this week. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=630.72s)]
*  Tim Walz is a fun killer. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=631.92s)]
*  Yes, everyone. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=633.28s)]
*  Not weird at all, though. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=634.24s)]
*  Well, look, my good friend Michael Mallis, who you had on your Fox show, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=635.44s)]
*  wrote the book on North Korea and he's just really smart guy and hilarious and a great guy. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=642.24s)]
*  But he pointed this out that a few years ago when Joe Rogan was taking ivermectin, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=647.04s)]
*  his doctor prescribed him ivermectin. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=653.52s)]
*  Is that the fish tank cleaner or the horse tranquilizer? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=655.12s)]
*  I can't remember which one. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=657.44s)]
*  All of them. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=658.72s)]
*  Horse dewormer. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=659.44s)]
*  There's a million different things that ivermectin does, yet they all picked horse dewormer [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=661.84s)]
*  and repeated that. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=666.72s)]
*  And then you could look back. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=667.76s)]
*  Sharp as attack. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=669.12s)]
*  Joe Biden. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=670.16s)]
*  Sharp as attack. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=670.72s)]
*  Sharp as attack. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=671.44s)]
*  Everyone said this in private meetings. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=672.24s)]
*  He's sharp as attack. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=673.7600000000001s)]
*  People forget the shortest lived propaganda campaign ever, which was way back last month, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=675.12s)]
*  was cheap fakes. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=680.5600000000001s)]
*  You remember for a week, you were told that there are these videos. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=682.8800000000001s)]
*  They're kind of like deep fakes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  What distinguishes them from deep fakes is that they're real videos. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=687.84s)]
*  But you see, Tucker, it's total. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=691.7600000000001s)]
*  They're trying to make it look like Joe Biden is old and senile, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=694.08s)]
*  but that's all just bullshit or whatever. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=696.48s)]
*  So they stay on message. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=698.4s)]
*  They very much stay on message. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=701.28s)]
*  Whereas the MAGA movement has nothing like that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=702.88s)]
*  And part of that is because Donald Trump's at the top, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=706.48s)]
*  and Donald Trump doesn't stay on message. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=708.9599999999999s)]
*  That's not how he works. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=710.72s)]
*  He's a stream of conscious type thinker who goes on stage and doesn't even know what he's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=711.76s)]
*  going to talk about. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=718.16s)]
*  He figures it out while he's up there. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=718.8s)]
*  There's something kind of endearing about that. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=720.16s)]
*  But more fundamentally, one movement is about the individual, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=723.4399999999999s)]
*  and the other is about the collective. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=726.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=729.04s)]
*  So the collective doesn't care about your opinion. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=729.52s)]
*  Well, it's amazing just that even of these people who work in places that you used to work, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=731.76s)]
*  some places you didn't work, but people in the New York Times or the Washington Post or CNN or NBC [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=738.72s)]
*  or CBS, that all of them, at least in their own minds, still pretend to be journalists. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=743.04s)]
*  And yet they're somehow able to just repeat the talking point exactly verbatim as everyone else [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=749.12s)]
*  does. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=755.68s)]
*  So anyway, my point is we don't want to be that because we don't want to be like, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  we don't want to all just be mindless drones. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=759.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=761.8399999999999s)]
*  However, it's amazing to me that Donald Trump, none of his surrogates, no one on the pro-Trump [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=762.3199999999999s)]
*  side seems to be able to effectively hit Kamala Harris with what is the most obvious thing [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=772.2399999999999s)]
*  to hit her with. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the greatest scandal in American history, which is like what you just said, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=781.84s)]
*  that we don't have a president. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=786.08s)]
*  The president of the United States, everybody has essentially admitted, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  is too senile to run for president. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=793.6s)]
*  Yet he's going to be president until January? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=797.36s)]
*  We are in a proxy war with the biggest nuclear power in the history of the world, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=799.9200000000001s)]
*  and we have another proxy war-ish type thing that looks to be [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  devolving into a wider regional war in Israel, and we don't have a president. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=810.6400000000001s)]
*  This is like the biggest scandal in the history of the Republic, if we're a Republic anymore. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=816.4000000000001s)]
*  And Kamala Harris is directly implicated in this. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=821.9200000000001s)]
*  She was one of the major people lying through her teeth that Joe Biden is sharp as a tack in [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=827.0400000000001s)]
*  private meetings. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=832.0s)]
*  And it seems like somehow the Trump campaign has not been able to effectively hit her for this. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=832.88s)]
*  It's like right there in front of us. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=841.12s)]
*  You pulling Joe Biden out was admitting that he's too senile to run for president. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=842.64s)]
*  Of course, yes. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=847.36s)]
*  And yet you're not invoking the 25th Amendment. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=847.76s)]
*  This is what it's for. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=849.52s)]
*  He clearly can't be president. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=851.04s)]
*  And then what does it say about the machine that they're quite happy with that? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=852.56s)]
*  That works very well for them. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=856.4s)]
*  I mean, there are two levels in which it's upsetting. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=858.4s)]
*  One is the practical level, which is you probably do want a commander in chief if you're on the cusp [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=860.56s)]
*  of nuclear war, which we are. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  But the other is philosophical and speaks to whether our current system can continue. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=868.9599999999999s)]
*  I mean, we're just admitting now that we don't have an executive, that we don't need an executive. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=874.0s)]
*  This is governed, that we are governed by an unelected body of people whose names we don't know, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=879.92s)]
*  whose motives we don't understand. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=885.28s)]
*  Like what? [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=886.64s)]
*  And also as we all- [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=887.8399999999999s)]
*  That's where the end, right? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=888.9599999999999s)]
*  And as we all know, the only reason they pulled Joe Biden is because it became clear he couldn't win. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=890.4s)]
*  But if he could have won, they'd be quite happy to keep him in there. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=896.16s)]
*  Like they like that. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=898.56s)]
*  It's probably better that they don't have this guy who every now and then might think he's president [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=899.52s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=903.92s)]
*  But why is there no curiosity about who they is? [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=904.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's a good question. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=907.36s)]
*  I mean, I can't answer that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=909.04s)]
*  I mean, I think most people assume Obama is at the top of that pyramid, but I can't confirm that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=910.3199999999999s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=915.28s)]
*  I haven't heard really anybody in a position of authority ask, like, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=915.76s)]
*  who does run the government? [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=919.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=921.04s)]
*  And I don't know that there's an easy- [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=921.44s)]
*  I mean, I don't know the answer to that, but I don't know that there's an easy answer. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=922.96s)]
*  I don't think it's Obama. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=926.96s)]
*  I mean, I think Obama has influence, you know? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=928.08s)]
*  But I don't know how much Obama really ran the government when he was president of the United States. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=930.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't, you know, I certainly know that he definitely at the very beginning got rolled by his generals. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=935.76s)]
*  And I think that he, you know, I don't exactly know where he was on some of these issues. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=943.52s)]
*  But at least with, like, what he ran on in terms of health care was not what Obamacare was at all. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=949.28s)]
*  In fact, if you remember way back in ancient history in 2008, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=957.4399999999999s)]
*  Hillary Clinton was the one who was for the individual mandate. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=962.3199999999999s)]
*  Of course. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=964.8s)]
*  And he criticized her. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=965.1999999999999s)]
*  I actually thought it was a great line he had in the debate. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=966.24s)]
*  He was like, the individual mandate solves the health insurance crisis in the same way [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=968.9599999999999s)]
*  that mandating you buy a house solves the homelessness problem, which was like a great line. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=973.68s)]
*  And that's totally exactly right. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=979.36s)]
*  How does that help anything to mandate you buy something that you've already deemed you can't afford to buy? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=981.12s)]
*  But then that's what Obamacare ultimately was. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=987.4399999999999s)]
*  And why is it? [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=989.4399999999999s)]
*  It was good for the insurance companies. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=990.0s)]
*  So it's like, it seems to me like he was always getting rolled by what are the powerful interests, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=992.96s)]
*  which are essentially big business that owns the government, uses the government as a tool to increase their profits. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=998.64s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1006.16s)]
*  I mean, I don't know who's really running things. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1006.88s)]
*  Is it the director of national intelligence? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1008.96s)]
*  Is it Biden's chief of staff? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't know, but it's not Joe Biden. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1013.52s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1015.92s)]
*  And Kamala Harris seems like kind of flotsam on the waves of history herself. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1016.64s)]
*  Like she's not, is she making independent judgments and choices that are, is she driving her own narrative? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1021.28s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1026.96s)]
*  I don't think she stands for anything. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1027.76s)]
*  You know, I don't think, I think she's just like, I don't think there's one issue ever where it's like, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1029.68s)]
*  no, she believes in this passion and she's going to, and she's going to stand up and try her best to make sure this goes through. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1033.84s)]
*  It's kind of like, you know, she was an aggressive prosecutor in California, but if she was a prosecutor right now in California, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1040.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm sure she'd be one of these progressive prosecutors. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1047.84s)]
*  It's just like, which way was the wind blowing? [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1049.9199999999998s)]
*  Is that the thing to get me more power? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1051.6s)]
*  Well, how's this for crazy? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1053.28s)]
*  Has there ever been a more volatile time in American politics? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1054.56s)]
*  Not in our lifetimes. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1058.56s)]
*  No one alive has ever seen anything like this. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1059.6799999999998s)]
*  But long before things started to really fall apart, the Heritage Foundation saw it coming. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1062.5600000000002s)]
*  Heritage has pulled together a coalition of over a hundred right-leaning groups to develop a [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1067.92s)]
*  comprehensive plan for day one that would include detailed policy proposals on the most pressing [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1072.4s)]
*  issues, the big ones, securing the border, controlling inflation, cracking down on election [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1077.3600000000001s)]
*  fraud, protecting the rights of the individual and saving the nation from being crushed by woke [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1082.72s)]
*  anti-human ideology. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1088.0800000000002s)]
*  The team at Heritage has also developed a plan to dismantle the deep state that keeps this nonsense [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1090.16s)]
*  going and reclaim this nation from a small group of technocrats that's broken everything. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1094.72s)]
*  Heritage is also running a training and vetting program to identify effective conservatives to [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1100.3200000000002s)]
*  serve in the next presidential administration, people who will share your values, this country's [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1105.8400000000001s)]
*  values, and actually do the job. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  It can't just be the same pool of discredited people from Washington [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1113.3600000000001s)]
*  populating every administration. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1118.16s)]
*  Heritage has a long head start and they put in a lot of work already, but they need your support [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1120.32s)]
*  to finish the job and to support the incoming president. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1124.72s)]
*  You can go to heritage.org slash Tucker and contribute to this important work today. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1127.92s)]
*  A lot depends on it. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1133.04s)]
*  Heritage.org slash Tucker. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1135.04s)]
*  Before we get into the details of what's actually happening right now, just to speed ahead a year, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1137.52s)]
*  no matter who wins, does anybody believe that our system functions as advertised? [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1141.6s)]
*  Do we know too much to sort of continue? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1147.04s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1152.6399999999999s)]
*  I think our system has worked this way for a very long time. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  What's really drastically changed is that people have really woken up to it. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1160.96s)]
*  It's a mix of several things, obviously, like the internet is a huge part of that, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1166.56s)]
*  and social media and stuff like that. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1170.8s)]
*  And then also just the Trump phenomenon. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1172.48s)]
*  The deep state coming out of the shadows to some degree. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1176.48s)]
*  I know I've heard you talk about this, the clip before, and I've played it a million times on my [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1180.24s)]
*  podcast, but where Chuck Schumer was on with Rachel Maddow. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1184.72s)]
*  Which is an amazing moment because she goes off script and she even says before she asked the [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1189.52s)]
*  question, she goes, I don't mean to put you on the spot here, but president-elect Donald Trump, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1197.9199999999998s)]
*  this is in January of 2016, he's won the election, but he's not president yet. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1202.96s)]
*  Because president-elect Donald Trump was just tweeting, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1206.8s)]
*  whatever, talking shit to the CIA or whatever. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1210.08s)]
*  And he just off the cuff in a real moment goes, I would not do that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1212.88s)]
*  It was like the most honest thing Chuck Schumer's ever said. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1218.16s)]
*  It was amazing. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1220.32s)]
*  They have six ways to Sunday to get back at you. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1221.04s)]
*  I never really believed, I mean, I was an idiot, obviously. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1224.24s)]
*  I didn't really believe any of that. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1227.6000000000001s)]
*  I was hunting probably 10 years ago down in South Texas, right in the Rio Grande on somebody's [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1230.0s)]
*  ranch, and this guy comes out with a box about this big and an aerial, like a fiberglass [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1234.4s)]
*  line that went up and the end of it was connected to a raccoon tail. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1244.96s)]
*  And it was a coyote call and they turned this thing on and it made the sound of a dying animal. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1249.28s)]
*  From the depths of Hades, these sounds. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1255.76s)]
*  And then this tail would whip around in the air like it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen in my life. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1257.92s)]
*  And out of nowhere, within about three minutes, all these animals showed up. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1262.8s)]
*  There was a big cat, all these coyotes. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1266.96s)]
*  And I thought that's kind of what Trump is. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1270.0s)]
*  He's like a coyote call. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1273.04s)]
*  He shows up and out of this landscape that looks desolate, like nothing's going on, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1274.24s)]
*  all of a sudden the predators come out and you see for the first time [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1278.72s)]
*  that you were always surrounded by these things. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1281.76s)]
*  They were always there. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  You just didn't see them. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1285.52s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1287.68s)]
*  And I felt that way very much about the intel agencies. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1288.56s)]
*  Of course, I applied to work at one. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1291.28s)]
*  I knew they were there, but I really had no idea that they agreed with running everything. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1293.12s)]
*  Well, I think that's exactly right. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1298.32s)]
*  Say in the 90s when I was a kid, and if my parents had, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1302.16s)]
*  they used to always have a crossfire. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  Before you were on it, it was the Pat Buchanan. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1312.72s)]
*  Yeah, and Tom Braden. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1314.8799999999999s)]
*  They'd have that on or whatever. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1316.64s)]
*  And they knew the CIA existed. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1319.04s)]
*  It's not like they weren't aware. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1321.2s)]
*  And they were like, yeah, it's a super secret spy organization [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1322.32s)]
*  that does super secret spy stuff. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1324.8799999999999s)]
*  Against our enemies. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1327.6s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1328.48s)]
*  But it was never like a thought like, okay, the presidential election between [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1328.8s)]
*  Clinton and Bob Dole is coming up. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1333.44s)]
*  How much is the CIA just crafting the illusion of what we see in front of us? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1335.6s)]
*  That never would have been a thought. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1340.16s)]
*  Now, that's a thought that's in a lot of people's minds. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1342.0s)]
*  The whole thing is fake. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1345.84s)]
*  There's a great quote that your CIA guy had when you asked about the Kennedy assassination. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1347.28s)]
*  It was such a great line because yes, the government was involved. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1351.92s)]
*  It's all fake. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1355.2s)]
*  That's the perfect line to describe it. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1357.36s)]
*  But we know that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1358.96s)]
*  I mean, I think people know that. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1360.08s)]
*  They know that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1361.52s)]
*  And that's why everyone's going crazy and really getting down these rabbit holes. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1362.0s)]
*  I understand why. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1366.0s)]
*  But like, does that ever change? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1367.52s)]
*  Like, once you know this, can you unknow it? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1370.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really good question. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1372.4s)]
*  And I don't think so. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1374.08s)]
*  I don't think you can put that toothpaste back in the tube. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1376.72s)]
*  I think ultimately that's probably, at least at this point, that's Trump's [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1379.6s)]
*  great accomplishment, you know, for better or worse. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1384.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it's for the better. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1388.1599999999999s)]
*  I think it's better to know things than to be in a state of ignorance. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1389.52s)]
*  But that is, there is no getting away from it. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1394.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's also, it's past the point, especially for Trump supporters, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1399.44s)]
*  I think we're way past the point of them ever believing the system is real. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1404.48s)]
*  Like even in 2020, let's just say hypothetically that the election was completely on the up and up [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1408.96s)]
*  and there was no, you know, fraud involved in the election. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1417.2s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg didn't spend $400 million. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1421.44s)]
*  Well, no, but that, I'm saying that stuff we know is real, right? [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1423.44s)]
*  Even the Time magazine piece that they ran. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1426.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1428.72s)]
*  So if you had a guy in Donald Trump with the entire media class and political class told you [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1429.2s)]
*  that it cannot be this guy, and not just like your opposition, like Mitt Romney, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1436.24s)]
*  the former, the last nominee before him said, anyone but this guy. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1440.0800000000002s)]
*  Everyone said you can't have this guy. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1443.8400000000001s)]
*  And the voters decided, no, we want this guy. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1445.3600000000001s)]
*  This is who we want. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1447.52s)]
*  And so they framed him for treason. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1448.4s)]
*  They framed the sitting US president for treason with a foreign hostile power. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1451.04s)]
*  That completely collapsed. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1456.0s)]
*  It's weird. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1457.52s)]
*  You don't hear anything about that. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1457.92s)]
*  I'm right. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1458.96s)]
*  Isn't that just that in itself? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1460.0800000000002s)]
*  So crazy that Vladimir Putin's plant is possibly going to be president again. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1461.76s)]
*  And no one in the media is even mentioning that as a thing. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1469.44s)]
*  And yet also not apologizing. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1472.3200000000002s)]
*  Like it's like they're not. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1474.8000000000002s)]
*  How can you do neither of those things? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1475.68s)]
*  How can you either say like, oh, Russia is about to have control of the White House again, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1477.52s)]
*  or hey, we were wrong about that whole Russia having control of the White House thing. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1481.6000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, so they frame him for treason. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1485.04s)]
*  They impeach him twice. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1487.52s)]
*  They raid his home in Mar-a-Lago. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1488.96s)]
*  All these things that happen. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1491.36s)]
*  How would you ever after that, if Trump loses, let's say, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1493.2s)]
*  how would any Trump supporter ever accept that this was real? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1496.8s)]
*  That he had a real, you know what I mean? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1499.92s)]
*  That our team actually lost and your team actually won. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1501.36s)]
*  It's always going to be viewed as like what it is. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  So you made such a smart point at breakfast, which I wish we had filmed because it was great. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1507.04s)]
*  But about how there's no effort by the establishment in Washington, both parties, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1511.92s)]
*  to win over people who support Trump. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1519.04s)]
*  There's no effort to convince them, to cajole them. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1522.72s)]
*  It feels like the people who run the country actually hate a lot of the country for real. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1528.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1533.6000000000001s)]
*  And there's, I was thinking about this. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1534.24s)]
*  I recently rewatched Pat Buchanan's speech from the 1992 convention, which was an amazing speech. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1536.48s)]
*  And he was a speechwriter for Nixon. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1546.88s)]
*  He was really, really good at playing speeches. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1548.96s)]
*  Like that was kind of his thing. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1551.2s)]
*  And it got the media flipped out about it. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1552.8000000000002s)]
*  They called it the culture war speech and all that. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1555.3600000000001s)]
*  I remember. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1557.3600000000001s)]
*  It wasn't really that culture war-y really. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1557.68s)]
*  But there was this one point where he said something along the lines of, [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1560.8000000000002s)]
*  he was talking about being on the campaign trail. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1565.3600000000001s)]
*  He had run and challenged George H.W. Bush. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1567.92s)]
*  And this was him coming back in to throw his supporters behind H.W. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1570.4s)]
*  A mistake in my opinion, but gave a great speech regardless. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1575.6000000000001s)]
*  But he said at one point that he was out there when he was talking to people who were really struggling. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1579.3600000000001s)]
*  As he was running, there's some woman who was talking about how she lost her job. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1583.76s)]
*  And they were going to maybe take her kid away from her. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1588.48s)]
*  And then there was some guy who worked at a plant that was going to close down. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1590.8s)]
*  And he was like, please save our jobs. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1594.72s)]
*  And he's kind of like touching moments. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1596.32s)]
*  And his message to the Republicans was like, look, these people are our people. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1598.0s)]
*  They're our fellow countrymen. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1604.32s)]
*  And we have to get back in touch with them. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1605.84s)]
*  And he said at one point, he goes, they don't expect miracles from us, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1608.8799999999999s)]
*  but they have to at least know that we care. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1613.44s)]
*  And it's amazing how little it takes. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1617.76s)]
*  One of the things about this Waltz guy, which he is... [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1621.28s)]
*  One of the things that I think is one of the reasons why they picked him [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1625.68s)]
*  is that he at least gets that you're supposed to talk about issues [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1628.48s)]
*  that maybe regular people might care about. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1632.96s)]
*  And it almost... [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1636.32s)]
*  This is why some of these old distinctions aren't as meaningful anymore. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1636.96s)]
*  I mean, don't get me wrong. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1641.12s)]
*  Like I'm for laissez-faire free markets. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1641.84s)]
*  I'm a libertarian. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1644.72s)]
*  I do not like socialism. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1645.76s)]
*  But at least someone like Bernie Sanders is talking about your health care costs [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1647.28s)]
*  or your take-home pay. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1654.0800000000002s)]
*  Why do the banks have all the power? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1655.6000000000001s)]
*  That's a fair question. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1656.88s)]
*  Yeah, things that kind of matter. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1657.92s)]
*  Whereas the corporate media is totally obsessed over January 6th. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1659.6000000000001s)]
*  Climate change. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  Climate change, racism, even democracy and this kind of weird abstraction, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1665.3600000000001s)]
*  the way they talk about it. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1671.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like, you know what people care about is price inflation. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1672.16s)]
*  My groceries are 30% more expensive. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1677.2s)]
*  That's like a big deal. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1679.52s)]
*  And so anyway, I think the Papu-Canon point was like, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1680.64s)]
*  you got to at least give them something. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1683.84s)]
*  Just something. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1686.0s)]
*  Try to do something for these people. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1686.96s)]
*  And it would, I would think it would take very little. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1689.04s)]
*  I mean, I think I've heard you say this before where it's just kind of like, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1693.04s)]
*  all right, you guys get your wall. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1696.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1698.16s)]
*  Like, okay, Donald Trump won and all you guys wanted to build. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1698.8s)]
*  Okay, so we're going to build a wall. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1701.3600000000001s)]
*  Because it's kind of a symbol that you still have a little bit of say [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1702.48s)]
*  in how the country is run. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1706.0s)]
*  And we're going to give you that and maybe like two other little things. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1707.6s)]
*  And we're going to keep all of the profits that we're raking in. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1710.64s)]
*  It's like something. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1714.08s)]
*  They don't want to offer any deal to the Trump supporters [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1715.28s)]
*  to try to pull them back in to this system. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1718.32s)]
*  And that is very creepy to me. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1721.12s)]
*  Well, it's ominous too, because if you don't care what people think, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1723.12s)]
*  well, first of all, a democracy required to care what they think. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1726.56s)]
*  So I guess we can settle that question. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1728.8s)]
*  No, it's not a democracy or even a republic. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1730.72s)]
*  But if you don't care, then you can kind of do, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1733.52s)]
*  there's no limit to what you can do to them. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1736.4s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1738.6399999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1739.76s)]
*  And but also even whether it's democracy or not, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1740.48s)]
*  because obviously we're not a democracy and obviously we're not a republic. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1744.16s)]
*  We're an oligarchy that's a world empire. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1748.32s)]
*  That's really how you would describe America. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1751.68s)]
*  But even in an authoritarian dictatorship, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1755.6s)]
*  there's limits to what you can do to your people. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1760.16s)]
*  You know, I mean, there's like you have to at least convince them [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1762.88s)]
*  that you're doing something on behalf of them. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1766.8000000000002s)]
*  Otherwise, people won't put up with it anymore. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1769.76s)]
*  It requires a lot of force to rule in a true autocratic way. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1772.96s)]
*  And even in Middle Eastern theocracies, I've seen it, [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1777.1200000000001s)]
*  the king or the crown prince or the guy in charge [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1780.16s)]
*  takes the temperature of the country every in the UAE every week. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1782.64s)]
*  The head of the country has to sit there while people from the provinces [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1787.6000000000001s)]
*  come in and complain to him in his house. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1790.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  And it's not just a kabuki like there, you know, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1793.36s)]
*  you have to keep in touch with what people want [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1796.3999999999999s)]
*  and you sort of have to deliver some percentage of it [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  or at least pretend you are. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1801.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1802.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1802.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1803.2s)]
*  You would think so. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1803.52s)]
*  I mean, it's kind of like, right, in a friendship or a marriage [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  or a business or anything. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1807.84s)]
*  Well, there's like, how about some more suffering and degradation for you? [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1809.12s)]
*  I would like a little more of that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1811.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1813.4399999999998s)]
*  And that makes it makes me worry about what happens if she wins. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1813.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1818.48s)]
*  Well, me too. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1818.88s)]
*  Although there's, you know, I think, I think, like Trump supporters [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1820.64s)]
*  and people who are who are, I think, truly dissidents of this regime [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1827.2s)]
*  have to, you know, look, like I said, we're never going to have [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1833.92s)]
*  the message discipline of the establishment and that's okay. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1837.3600000000001s)]
*  We don't want that. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1841.04s)]
*  I think we do have to be wiser about like, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1842.0s)]
*  how exactly are we going to attack this thing? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1845.2s)]
*  You know, like I'm like a I'm a hardcore libertarian [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1847.76s)]
*  and there's that's a very small group of people in this country. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1853.36s)]
*  There's some, you know, but there's not that many. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1857.28s)]
*  No, we can't. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1859.68s)]
*  You know, now there's enough that like Donald Trump [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1860.32s)]
*  came to the Libertarian Convention because it's it's a election. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1862.08s)]
*  Presidential elections are close these days and any little block like helps. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1866.0s)]
*  But if you're talking about like Trump supporters, it's okay. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1870.16s)]
*  Hey, you got tens of millions of people in this country [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1873.28s)]
*  and you could see where look, there's real lessons to be learned [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1876.48s)]
*  from last year's the boycotts of Target and Bud Light. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1880.96s)]
*  Just in that forget even like politics, just in terms of being consumers. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1884.8s)]
*  Hey, look at the power you guys have. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1888.64s)]
*  If you decide to do something, you can really do something [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1890.56s)]
*  and you can change the direction of the culture, the direction of the country. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1894.4s)]
*  But you got to be really smart about when you decide to do it [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1898.64s)]
*  and who you decide to go after. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1902.56s)]
*  Man, it was frustrating to me to see like. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1904.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump gets shot in the head, you know, does this. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1907.76s)]
*  And it's the reason why he's alive. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1914.6399999999999s)]
*  If he hadn't done that, his brains are blown out on national television. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1916.6399999999999s)]
*  Now, what we know about this, and obviously there's a lot more to uncover, but. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1921.4399999999998s)]
*  Let's just say best case scenario, it was a wild failure. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1926.32s)]
*  You know, like a failure that you really can't even imagine. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1933.3600000000001s)]
*  You've seen some of the videos. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1936.0800000000002s)]
*  This kid is walking around and scoping out the area for over an hour before he's there. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1937.44s)]
*  He's allowed to be on a roof that's 150 yards away from the former president [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1944.0800000000002s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1950.48s)]
*  People on the ground are screaming. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  This guy's got a gun. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1954.16s)]
*  And OK, so like. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1956.0s)]
*  But Joe Biden's employees allowed it. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1957.92s)]
*  Joe Biden's. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1960.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1961.2800000000002s)]
*  Their executive employees and also taken to account all the other things that they've [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1961.68s)]
*  done to this guy. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1965.92s)]
*  And then they allowed this to happen. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1966.88s)]
*  And two weeks later. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1970.4s)]
*  All of right wing Twitter is up in arms about some trannies in the opening ceremony of the [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1972.96s)]
*  Olympics. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1979.76s)]
*  And it's like, guys, focus. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1980.64s)]
*  Like, you know, like, come on, man, I don't like that stuff either. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1984.0s)]
*  And I think it's awful that they're shoving that in everyone's face. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1986.8s)]
*  And that shouldn't have been at the opening ceremonies. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1989.04s)]
*  But hey, no, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1990.64s)]
*  Outrage is a finite resource, just like everything else. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1993.5200000000002s)]
*  And we are outraged about this thing. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1996.4s)]
*  You know, like not that we're outraged about this. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=1998.48s)]
*  And all it would take would be a little bit of focus. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2001.44s)]
*  OK, we're not going to have the message discipline of the corporate media, but like just a little [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2004.96s)]

*  focus on all of our energy like that. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2014.4s)]
*  We're getting the bottom of that assassination attempt. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2016.4s)]
*  What the hell happened there? [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2018.48s)]
*  You know, they could do it. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2019.8400000000001s)]
*  We could figure that out. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2021.04s)]
*  This isn't this isn't Kennedy where we have one, you know, film that we have to all rely [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2022.08s)]
*  on. We got a bunch of different camera angles. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2027.2s)]
*  We got we can track this kid's cell phone. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2029.04s)]
*  We could do all types of different things. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2030.96s)]
*  And like to me, the major man, my first message to every like America first type or even [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2032.8799999999999s)]
*  like or the Glenn Greenwald, like true leftists or anyone who's kind of a dissident of this [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2040.08s)]
*  regime. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2045.36s)]
*  It's like the rule is we only support America first non interventionist candidates and [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2045.76s)]
*  anybody who has anything to say to you about war with Iran is your enemy. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2054.88s)]
*  You're not on their side and you're not supporting them. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2059.92s)]
*  You will not support Lindsey Graham. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2062.4s)]
*  You know how the hell let a Democrat get in. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2064.32s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2066.48s)]
*  Is it any worse than Lindsey Graham? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2067.84s)]
*  No, it would be much better. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2069.84s)]
*  Probably better, of course, because it's more straightforward. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2071.04s)]
*  I completely agree with you completely. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2073.84s)]
*  And it's and it is the neocons. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2076.7200000000003s)]
*  It's all the Republican Senate committee chairman. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2079.44s)]
*  It's Lindsey Graham. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2081.84s)]
*  It's Mitch McConnell. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2082.7200000000003s)]
*  It's all the creepy war worshipers who will immediately on every other issue. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2083.68s)]
*  Whip around and betray you. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2091.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's exactly because they're fundamentally corrupt and you just don't agree [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2093.2000000000003s)]
*  with them. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2095.92s)]
*  And, you know, maybe some of them are nice people. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2096.2400000000002s)]
*  I haven't met any, but I'm sure that they exist. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2097.84s)]
*  But yeah, they shouldn't be in the coalition. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2100.6400000000003s)]
*  But to the assassination, it seems like, you know, the difference between climate change [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2104.0800000000004s)]
*  or equity or systemic racism and assassination is like bullets are real. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2111.2000000000003s)]
*  We can measure their trajectory. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2118.48s)]
*  We can measure their effect. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2120.1600000000003s)]
*  We saw it on video. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2121.5200000000004s)]
*  Like that's actually real in the way that war is real. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2122.7200000000003s)]
*  Violence is real. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  And so that's got to be at the top position of concern, right? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2127.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, 100 percent. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2131.04s)]
*  And I don't I don't understand how we could just lied right past that. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2132.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2135.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2136.08s)]
*  What do you think actually happened? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2136.48s)]
*  You know, I got to say it's just it looks like it is what it obviously is. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2140.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I agree with you. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2145.28s)]
*  I mean, I just I don't know. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2146.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know enough to prove the case. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2147.68s)]
*  I did see there was there was I can't remember who somebody at the blaze [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2150.64s)]
*  who had they had reported that, you know, because, you know, it's not just the government [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2154.7200000000003s)]
*  who's tracking your phones. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2160.88s)]
*  It's like a million. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2162.56s)]
*  Every app is. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2163.44s)]
*  Of course. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2164.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, you can buy the geolocation. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2166.56s)]
*  So they had they had a phone from the shooter's house that had gone to D.C. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2166.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2171.92s)]
*  And been at this spot that's like known to be where FBI meets with like their informants [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2172.4s)]
*  and stuff like that on the road from FBI headquarters. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2176.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2179.2000000000003s)]
*  What are we looking at here? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2180.56s)]
*  And then, of course, you know, I mean, it's like, look, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2181.92s)]
*  let's just say there's like a serial killer in a neighborhood and they've killed like 11 people. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2184.4s)]
*  And then there's a 12th person who's dead. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2190.4s)]
*  And you see that serial killer leaving their house on video. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2192.8s)]
*  It's like, OK, I'm not saying that's maybe not enough evidence to go to a court of law [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2196.48s)]
*  and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that this person killed them. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2201.04s)]
*  But I mean, like if we're all just looking at that, we're like, I'm pretty sure my starting [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2204.96s)]
*  assumption is going to be that guy did it. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2210.32s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2211.92s)]
*  And like it's just every listen. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2212.64s)]
*  You predicted this a year ago. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2214.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was pretty obvious. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2217.44s)]
*  We're obviously on the trajectory to ending all the time. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2218.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's not hard. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2222.3199999999997s)]
*  And so then when it happens, it is pretty difficult to not go all right. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2223.04s)]
*  I mean, because if it's not that, then you're saying, OK, so what explains this guy being [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2229.12s)]
*  a block away from the FBI building? [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2233.52s)]
*  What explains the fact that this was allowed to happen? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2236.64s)]
*  I mean, it's just so it's so hard to understand what other explanation that [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2239.04s)]
*  the Biden administration clearly planted or allowed the planting of. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2244.24s)]
*  But I think they clearly did plant pipe bombs on the morning of January 6th in front of [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2247.68s)]
*  the DNC and the RNC. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2253.7599999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris was at the DNC that morning. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2254.96s)]
*  I mean, I think that's shown. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2257.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2258.72s)]
*  And then nobody cares. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2259.12s)]
*  You were the only guy in cable news who would repeatedly bring this up. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2261.04s)]
*  Literally nobody else. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2265.44s)]
*  Nobody else is even interested in what what the hell was that? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2266.96s)]
*  Most of us. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2270.16s)]
*  Well, actually, all of us go through our daily lives using all sorts of quote free technology [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2270.8s)]
*  without paying attention to why it's quote free. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2276.4s)]
*  Who's paying for this and how? [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2279.6s)]
*  Think about it for a minute. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2281.92s)]
*  Think about your free email account, the free messenger system used to chat with your friends, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2283.04s)]
*  the free weather app or game app you open up and never think about. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2288.48s)]
*  It's all free. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2292.88s)]
*  But is it? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2294.48s)]
*  No, it's not free. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2295.44s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products and just giving them to you because [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2298.0s)]
*  they love you. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2301.76s)]
*  They're doing it because their programs take all your information. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2303.68s)]
*  They hoover up your data, private personal data and sell it to data brokers and the government. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2306.48s)]
*  And all of those people who are not your friends are very interested in manipulating you [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2314.0s)]
*  and your personal political and financial decisions. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2318.96s)]
*  It's scary as hell. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2321.84s)]
*  And it's happening out in the open without anybody saying anything about it. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2323.44s)]
*  This is a huge problem. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2327.44s)]
*  And we've been talking about this problem to our friend, Eric Prince, for years. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2328.7200000000003s)]
*  Someone needs to fix this. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2332.4s)]
*  And he and his partners have. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2334.32s)]
*  And now we're partners with them and their company is called Unplugged. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2335.68s)]
*  It's not a software company. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2339.52s)]
*  It's a hardware company. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2340.8s)]
*  They actually make a phone. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2342.32s)]
*  The phone is called Unplugged. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2344.56s)]
*  And it's more than that. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2346.64s)]
*  The purpose of the phone is to protect you from having your life stolen, your data stolen. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2347.84s)]
*  It's designed from a privacy first perspective. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2355.6800000000003s)]
*  It's got an operating system that they made. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2359.84s)]
*  It's called Messenger and other apps that help you take charge of your personal data [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2361.44s)]
*  and prevent it from getting passed around to data brokers and government agencies that [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2364.7200000000003s)]
*  will use it to manipulate you. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2369.52s)]
*  Unplugged's commitment is to its customers. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2371.76s)]
*  They will promise you and they mean it that your data are not being sold or monetized [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2373.92s)]
*  or shared with anyone from basics like its custom Libertas operating system, which they wrote, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2378.2400000000002s)]
*  which is designed from the very first day to keep your personal data on your device. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2384.32s)]
*  It also has, believe it or not, a true on off switch that shuts off the power. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2389.04s)]
*  It actually disconnects your battery and ensures that your microphone and your camera are turned [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2393.6800000000003s)]
*  off completely when you want them to be. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2399.12s)]
*  So they're not spying on you and say your bedroom, which your iPhone is. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2401.68s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2405.2799999999997s)]
*  So it is a great way, one of the few ways to actually protect yourself from big tech [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2407.04s)]
*  and big government to reclaim your personal privacy. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2411.44s)]
*  Without privacy, there is no freedom. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2414.64s)]
*  The unplugged phone, you can get a $25 discount when you use the code Tucker at the checkout. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2416.96s)]
*  So go to unplugged.com slash Tucker to get yours today. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2422.0s)]
*  Highly recommended. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2426.56s)]
*  You got to pay close attention. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2427.7599999999998s)]
*  Don't let the three card money thing distract you. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2430.0s)]
*  The moving walnut shell. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2433.28s)]
*  Just remember what you care about is who's got the guns. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2434.56s)]
*  Watch the guns. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2438.8s)]
*  That's why I think we don't pay any attention all to what's happening in the United States military, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2439.6s)]
*  which is clearly wildly politicized. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2443.36s)]
*  That's not accidental. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2445.36s)]
*  It's not ideological. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2446.32s)]
*  It's practical. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2447.76s)]
*  You suborn the people with guns. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2449.12s)]
*  You control the people with guns and then you have power because it's out of the barrel [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2450.64s)]
*  of a gun, the political power grows. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2453.68s)]
*  Right? [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2455.36s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2456.64s)]
*  I don't know why no one is focused on that stuff, but if the Secret Service, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2458.0s)]
*  heavily armed federal agency, is a political tool, then it's like you really have to rethink the terms. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2462.7200000000003s)]
*  100%. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2470.32s)]
*  And to your point about the three card monty thing is like what I was saying about the Olympic opening [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2471.44s)]
*  ceremonies, right? [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2475.76s)]
*  Is that there are these things that are clearly done to trigger right wingers. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2476.56s)]
*  Of course. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2482.6400000000003s)]
*  We're just doing the thing that makes the conservative DNAs blood boil, right? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2483.7599999999998s)]
*  And so like, okay, be aware of that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2490.08s)]
*  Now, I'm not even saying that there's not a point where that is necessary to fight again. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2491.8399999999997s)]
*  Like, you know, if they're coming after children or something like that, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2498.08s)]
*  or teaching like this garbage to kids, okay, no, listen, I get it. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2501.44s)]
*  That is something that's worth dying over, you know what I mean? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2505.12s)]
*  And I'm not suggesting anybody do anything illegal or come back. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2509.04s)]
*  I'm just saying that someone coming after your children is something, okay, that must be fought. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2511.68s)]
*  But also just at least recognize that yes, this is a tactic. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2517.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a distraction tactic to get you caught up in the latest outrage of the day, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2522.16s)]
*  and then also to look crazy to normal people. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2527.52s)]
*  You know, so they're like to someone who's in the middle, or maybe someone who's like, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2532.08s)]
*  you know, kind of a more liberal person, but they're not part of an evil cabal. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2536.0s)]
*  They're just, you know, grew up in Brooklyn or whatever. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2539.84s)]
*  It's like, they just see right where it's like, man, these guys are like obsessed over like, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2542.32s)]
*  whether there was a dude in a dress at the opening ceremony, like that. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2546.6400000000003s)]
*  It's much easier to dismiss you. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2549.92s)]
*  Whereas if you're like relentlessly focused on something that really matters, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2551.76s)]
*  it's much more difficult. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2555.5200000000004s)]
*  And so that's a big part of it, right? [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2556.88s)]
*  Like, yeah, don't get distracted by the three card Monte. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2558.4s)]
*  And then to your point, I think that about like who controls the guns, [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2561.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that's also a big part of the reason why they've been so triggered by the Trump [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2565.36s)]
*  movement in general is also because Donald Trump is leading a right-wing populist movement. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2574.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2579.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's very scary to elites. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2580.0800000000004s)]
*  Because it's armed. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2581.76s)]
*  It's armed and tough. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2582.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2584.32s)]
*  You know, I mean, like a left-wing populist. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2584.5600000000004s)]
*  They should be afraid. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2586.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2587.52s)]
*  I hope they are afraid. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2587.76s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think that's right. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2588.7200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, I was talking about this. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2590.32s)]
*  I was down with Candace Owens. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2592.0800000000004s)]
*  I just did her podcast last week and I was talking about this, but it's not like they're [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2594.8799999999997s)]
*  not a fan of left-wing populism either. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2598.9599999999996s)]
*  They hate it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2601.12s)]
*  Yeah, no, they don't like it. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2601.7599999999998s)]
*  We went to war with Russia to hide the fact that they rigged the primaries against Bernie [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2604.24s)]
*  Sanders, a left-wing populist. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2608.4799999999996s)]
*  Like that's- [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2609.9199999999996s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2611.04s)]
*  And there's a reason why they rigged the election against Bernie Sanders. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  There's a reason why he was unacceptable to them. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2614.4799999999996s)]
*  But not- they freak out quite the way they did over Donald Trump. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2617.68s)]
*  And I think a lot of that's because if you look at the people in Bernie Sanders' movements- [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2623.84s)]
*  What are they going to do about it? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2628.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2629.1200000000003s)]
*  Like, okay, you've armed- you've gotten all of the male feminists together. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2630.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2635.5200000000004s)]
*  Good luck with that overthrowing power. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2637.2000000000003s)]
*  However, when you get every barrel-chested man in America, every gun enthusiast, every [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2640.0800000000004s)]
*  outdoorsman, and also a ton of cops and military, which by the way, I think kind of explains what [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2646.4s)]
*  you're talking about with the politicizing of the military. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2652.4s)]
*  And that was a big part of what the Vax mandate was too. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2658.48s)]
*  We got to get some of these guys out of here. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2658.7200000000003s)]
*  They're afraid of testosterone and they want to identify who's got it in abundance and they [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  want to isolate and punish those people. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2665.28s)]
*  That's why they're against nicotine. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2666.88s)]
*  That's why Walls raised the taxes on nicotine pouches. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2668.0s)]
*  Of course, they're not carcinogens. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2672.64s)]
*  There's no evidence, by the way, that nicotine is a carcinogen. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2673.92s)]
*  It's not that we know of. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2677.36s)]
*  It's all a lie. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2679.2000000000003s)]
*  What they hate about nicotine is it raises testosterone levels. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2680.4s)]
*  They even suppress that fact. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2683.6s)]
*  That's a fact on Google. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2685.28s)]
*  Google nicotine and testosterone and see how many results it takes you to get to the core [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2687.6s)]
*  truth, which is yes, nicotine use raises testosterone levels. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2694.08s)]
*  Man, it is way, way down. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2697.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's not an accident. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2699.12s)]
*  They're afraid of testosterone. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2700.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2701.6800000000003s)]
*  No, listen, 100%. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2702.08s)]
*  That's completely right. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2704.48s)]
*  Even on top of it, even like cigarettes, there certainly is some evidence that [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2706.08s)]
*  cigarettes are very bad for you. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2710.64s)]
*  There's overwhelming evidence. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2711.84s)]
*  Yeah, they are. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2712.88s)]
*  You shouldn't smoke cigarettes, although it is cool. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2713.6800000000003s)]
*  It's really cool. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2715.44s)]
*  I miss it. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2716.2400000000002s)]
*  Vaping is so lame. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2716.88s)]
*  Every time I do it, I wish I was just smoking a cigarette. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2718.2400000000002s)]
*  But anyway, okay. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2720.4s)]
*  Trade-offs. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2721.84s)]
*  But the trade-offs, exactly. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2722.16s)]
*  Trade-offs makes my wife happier. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2723.92s)]
*  Okay, it's worth it. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2725.12s)]
*  I travel the country a lot because I'm a stand-up comic. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2728.88s)]
*  I'm on the road all the time. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2730.88s)]
*  Look, there's no question. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2733.36s)]
*  Way less people smoke now than you used to. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2735.3599999999997s)]
*  It's like, okay, that worked. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2737.68s)]
*  It turns out economic incentives do work. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2739.2s)]
*  Do you tax something? [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2741.2s)]
*  You get less of it than you otherwise would. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2742.0s)]
*  That's why it's so great that we tax income. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2743.44s)]
*  And you get less of that than you otherwise would. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2745.92s)]
*  But I go all throughout this country. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2749.92s)]
*  And like, yeah, people don't smoke as much as they used to. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2751.52s)]
*  But everywhere you go, it's just Arby's, McDonald's, Burger King. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2754.4s)]
*  You know, it's like it's not- [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2760.8799999999997s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2761.92s)]
*  It's not like health is really the concern here. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2762.56s)]
*  So like, what is actually the concern? [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2765.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, public health has gotten much worse in the last 30 years. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2767.04s)]
*  So you don't have a problem with people being lethargic and obese. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2769.52s)]
*  You have a problem with them smoking cigarettes. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2773.36s)]
*  So what explains that? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2776.88s)]
*  And I think you just explained it. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2778.0s)]
*  It's the same reason they don't like the AR-15 [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2779.52s)]
*  because it's a visible sign of your autonomy. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2781.68s)]
*  And they hate that. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2784.72s)]
*  It's a threat to their control. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2785.36s)]
*  And no, I couldn't agree more. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2787.36s)]
*  So Tim Walz, just to descend into the political for a second, [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2789.76s)]
*  what do you make of that pick? [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2795.0400000000004s)]
*  How's that going? [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2797.0400000000004s)]
*  I was somewhat surprised by it. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2800.6400000000003s)]
*  I didn't think- [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2803.5200000000004s)]
*  I would have bet money Shapiro was getting it. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2804.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I thought until- [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2806.5600000000004s)]
*  I mean, they kind of sent the signals over the last couple weeks that he was out. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2808.88s)]
*  But I was assuming Mark Kelly was going to be the guy [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2812.48s)]
*  because he's, from what I understood, they were friendly with Harris. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2815.1200000000003s)]
*  He's got kind of this thing where his wife was shot and he's an astronaut. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2818.8s)]
*  And there is just something about that that's like- [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2823.1200000000003s)]
*  You kind of can't help, but it is an archetype of a guy who's appealing. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2826.0800000000004s)]
*  And also because he's in Arizona. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2831.6800000000003s)]
*  So I just thought he was the obvious choice. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2834.32s)]
*  The Shapiro thing, I think, evidently came down to him just being too ambitious [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2837.44s)]
*  and kind of like Kamala Harris can't really have someone around her. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2842.0800000000004s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2846.6400000000003s)]
*  Because you just can't because she's so unimpressive. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2847.44s)]
*  He wasn't beta enough. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2849.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's right. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2850.96s)]
*  And then I guess this guy fit that mold. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2852.0s)]
*  I do- [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2854.8s)]
*  My initial impression- [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2856.4s)]
*  This is not somebody I knew much about until this last week. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2858.56s)]
*  But my initial impression is that he's also very unimpressive [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2862.8s)]
*  and that he's not particularly bright. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2867.92s)]
*  And he does, as I mentioned, he does at least seem to understand [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2871.04s)]
*  that you got to try to talk about stuff that people actually care about. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2874.96s)]
*  And he understands that we live in a populist moment. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2878.64s)]
*  So he's trying to be kind of a populist or present himself that way. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2881.76s)]
*  But again, I just think the thing is I think it's totally fake and astroturfed. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2886.64s)]
*  And the idea that we're supposed to pretend that he has- [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2890.8s)]
*  Remember when they were like, Beto O'Rourke has the it factor. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2897.12s)]
*  It's just so- [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2901.6s)]
*  I miss him. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2902.4s)]
*  He was the best. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2903.68s)]
*  What world are you living in where you look at that guy and you go, [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2904.4s)]
*  man, just dripping with charisma. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2907.28s)]
*  It's like, so they're doing that right now. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2909.84s)]
*  And this is just totally anecdotal and I don't know what it means. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2911.76s)]
*  But I have personally, I've gotten like 30 text messages about donating to Democrats [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2914.4s)]
*  in the last two weeks. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2922.6400000000003s)]
*  And I've never donated to- [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2923.84s)]
*  No, I donated to Tulsi Gabbard when she was running in 2019. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2926.7200000000003s)]
*  Because it was like the thing where you needed individual donations to make the debate stage. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2932.0s)]
*  And I just wanted her on the debate stage. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2935.6s)]
*  And so I mean, they're doing all types of maneuvering to give the impression that there's [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2940.24s)]
*  enthusiasm and support for these guys, including things like having, I don't know, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2947.2s)]
*  I'm out of touch and all that, but having like all these rappers or whatever at her event. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2951.2799999999997s)]
*  So you get a bunch of people who are going to see the rapper and then you go, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2955.44s)]
*  look at all these people coming to Kamala Harris' event. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2959.36s)]
*  They have all of their techniques that they use. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2962.0s)]
*  I just, I think it's fake. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2965.44s)]
*  That Walls guy, I mean, I don't want to be too unfair because I don't know him and I don't have [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2969.52s)]
*  any hard evidence. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2973.28s)]
*  He's a weirdo. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2974.6400000000003s)]
*  That guy's weird. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2975.44s)]
*  He seems very strange. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2976.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2976.8s)]
*  There's something not right about that guy's personal life. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2977.52s)]
*  So I hope I'm wrong because I don't want people like that with power. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2981.28s)]
*  But most people I know with power in Washington have personal lives who would not [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2984.1600000000003s)]
*  withstand scrutiny at all. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2988.56s)]
*  But I think that, but I can't get past the core fact about Walls, which is he presided over [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2991.04s)]
*  allowed the biggest city in the state to get burned down. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=2997.84s)]
*  And seemed to not only allow it, but kind of, we like to support it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3001.84s)]
*  You know, kind of, you see the video of his wife saying I kept the windows open so I could [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3007.2s)]
*  smell the burning rubber from the riots. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3010.7999999999997s)]
*  I did not see that. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3013.36s)]
*  Wow. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3014.32s)]
*  The wife whose hand he shook. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3014.64s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3016.72s)]
*  By the way, I mean, I know it's picking on a little thing, but who the hell shakes their [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3017.76s)]
*  wife's hand? [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3023.44s)]
*  Well, Kamala Harris and her fake husband kissed each other with masks on. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3024.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3028.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just so, I guess, look, I think I'm pretty libertarian on the part I am. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3029.1200000000003s)]
*  I mean, I've been in TV my whole life. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3034.2400000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of people with weird personal lives. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3035.84s)]
*  I'm not a judge at all. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3037.36s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3038.48s)]
*  However, if everybody in power has some sort of weird celibate, you know, Mitch McConnell [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3039.28s)]
*  and his wife and Kamala Harris and her husband is Tim Walz guy, like there's just no chance [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3045.12s)]
*  these are normal marriages at all. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3050.16s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3051.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3053.2s)]
*  And people were bad and they were they were jumping on on JD Vance for I think it was [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3053.44s)]
*  with you. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3059.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it was an old clip where he was just talking about like all these childless people [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3060.24s)]
*  making decisions for the country. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3064.08s)]
*  And look, like I'm not I'm not again, I'm with you on that. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3065.52s)]
*  I'm not like judging people. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3069.68s)]
*  I don't think there are some people who shouldn't have kids. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3070.72s)]
*  You know, it's the best thing I've ever done. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3072.88s)]
*  But I certainly think there are people who wouldn't make very good parents. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3074.96s)]
*  There are people who are very bad parents who probably would have been. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3078.0s)]
*  Yeah, I wouldn't. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3080.32s)]
*  I'm not for mandatory childbearing. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3080.88s)]
*  But like, come on, there is something to be said for like, I kind of would like a lot [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3083.68s)]
*  of our leaders to like, yeah, just be in a marriage where they love their wife and they [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3090.2400000000002s)]
*  have some kids. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3094.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it gives you some stakes that you really can't get any other way. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3094.96s)]
*  And yeah, there's just there is no question. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3099.68s)]
*  It is very, very bizarre people who seem to disproportionately rise to the top. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3102.4s)]
*  And it's so obvious that they're bizarre. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3108.56s)]
*  I mean, I look at this walls guy and I'm like, again, I don't know. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3110.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't have a police report that I'm not sharing or something. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3113.52s)]
*  But that guy, not babysitting my kids, like no way. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3115.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3120.08s)]
*  No way. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3120.48s)]
*  Which is what's so strange about them going with the line of JD Vance being weird. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3120.8s)]
*  Like, I understand they're in like a little bit of a pickle where they're like, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3126.7200000000003s)]
*  okay, they have to find rhetoric. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3131.28s)]
*  You know, the Trump just got shot, so they have to kind of pull back on like the Nazi [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3132.5600000000004s)]
*  stuff because it's not really working. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3137.44s)]
*  And also it's really hard to say you're not kind of, you know, it's really hard to be [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3139.44s)]
*  like, oh, the right wingers are inciting violence when they say fake news. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3143.1200000000003s)]
*  But like, we're not inciting violence when we say the democracy is on the line unless [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3149.28s)]
*  this guy is taken out, you know? [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3154.0800000000004s)]
*  But it's like weird. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3156.7200000000003s)]
*  You're using the word weird. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3157.92s)]
*  You're the party of freaks. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3159.36s)]
*  Like, what are you talking about? [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3161.44s)]
*  I know. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3162.48s)]
*  How are you going to, how is weird going to be a pejorative for you when you're literally [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3162.96s)]
*  sitting here going, you see that dude with a beard and a dress? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3167.52s)]
*  That's a beautiful woman. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3171.0400000000004s)]
*  And then you can call someone else weird. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3172.48s)]
*  It's just so strange. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3174.48s)]
*  Every accusation is an admission. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3176.1600000000003s)]
*  But I also think it's just, I don't want to go on too much, but I don't want to be mean. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3180.1600000000003s)]
*  But it's interesting. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3184.1600000000003s)]
*  I've always thought this was so strange, especially in the Democratic Party. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3185.92s)]
*  You know, they're always telling you that, you know, gay is great. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3189.84s)]
*  It's better to be gay. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3192.2400000000002s)]
*  We love gays. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3193.6s)]
*  We're celebrating Stonewall. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3194.64s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3195.84s)]
*  But then there's so many people in the Democratic Party who are closeted, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3197.36s)]
*  including in, you know, positions of real power. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3201.2s)]
*  I know them. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3203.6s)]
*  I don't believe in outing people and I'm not going to, but I know that for a fact. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3204.08s)]
*  And it's like, on what grounds are you hiding it actually? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3208.7200000000003s)]
*  That's too much. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3211.92s)]
*  I can't. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3213.2s)]
*  I also have absolutely nothing against gay people. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3213.92s)]
*  I do have an issue with people living a lie. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3218.16s)]
*  Well, kind of, yeah. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3220.72s)]
*  Because there's something about it's also not just lying, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3221.6s)]
*  but living a lie is like a, it's a profound thing where you get used to every inch of [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3224.16s)]
*  your existence being a lie. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3231.7599999999998s)]
*  The very nature of who you are is a lie. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3234.3999999999996s)]
*  And that just obviously leads to like people who have the ability to totally lie about who they are. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3238.3199999999997s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3245.8399999999997s)]
*  That I do have an issue with. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3246.3199999999997s)]
*  Nicely put. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3247.52s)]
*  And there's so much of it. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3248.32s)]
*  I can't get over it. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3249.68s)]
*  And I'm not saying that as like a blue nose or even as a judgment on the morality of it. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3251.04s)]
*  But I mean, I just find it so striking. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3258.56s)]
*  Like how many people like that are there in Washington? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3260.4s)]
*  It's wildly disproportionate, wildly. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3263.52s)]
*  Even compared to like San Francisco or some libertine place like that, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3267.04s)]
*  or the West Village, there are freakier personal lives in DC. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3269.7599999999998s)]
*  I just find that really, really telling. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3273.52s)]
*  I don't know what it means exactly, but it has to with lying. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3275.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3279.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3279.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3280.0s)]
*  And I don't exactly know either. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3280.72s)]
*  I mean, I do think that like, look, as we've kind of learned like a bit from the Jeffrey Epstein [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3282.0s)]
*  thing, and I guess we're, so we find out that there's this child pedophile blackmail ring [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3290.8s)]
*  that was pretty clearly involved a foreign country. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3301.6s)]
*  And it's going around compromising political leaders and influential people. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3306.64s)]
*  And I guess we're supposed to pretend like that must have been the only one. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3312.4s)]
*  And it's over now. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3316.96s)]
*  I mean, we never got to the bottom of it. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3318.48s)]
*  And sure, all of the cameras malfunctioned and the guy, you know, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3320.4s)]
*  committed suicide and we never get the client lists and we never get any of the- [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3323.2799999999997s)]
*  The sitting attorney general of the United States Barr covered it up. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3327.04s)]
*  Yes. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3330.7999999999997s)]
*  Cover it up, which he did. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3331.84s)]
*  Yep. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3333.04s)]
*  That's right. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3333.52s)]
*  And I've said that a bunch of times and every time he tells someone I know that, you know, [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3334.08s)]
*  that's outrageous, he complains and I hope he'll sue me over that because it's true. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3337.36s)]
*  Let's go to discovery. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3341.28s)]
*  A hundred percent Barr lied about it. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3342.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3344.1600000000003s)]
*  And so, okay. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3344.6400000000003s)]
*  Why? What was that? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3345.36s)]
*  Right. Well, that's the big question. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3346.56s)]
*  And then like, what is still going on? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3348.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean, obviously there were people above Jeffrey Epstein involved in it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3351.44s)]
*  And obviously, if you were doing something like that, you wouldn't only have one. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3355.36s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3359.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3361.12s)]
*  And so you do, it does at least make you wonder like, oh, is it possible that people who, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3361.28s)]
*  obviously people who can be blackmailed are very easy to control. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3369.2s)]
*  And so, oh, why would it be that there are so many people in powerful positions who have these [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3372.88s)]
*  secret weird personal lives? And I think plausibly part of that explanation is because like, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3378.8s)]
*  well, okay, then they're very easy to blackmail. You can control them. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3386.56s)]
*  Do you ever think about your own life in these terms? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3389.68s)]
*  Like you're one of the people who will just say what you think is true period. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3392.48s)]
*  And you're always punching up, not down always. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3396.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3399.9199999999996s)]
*  And I don't know, there's a non-trivial risk to that. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3400.64s)]
*  Do you ever consider that as the father of small children? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3403.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No, I've definitely thought about it before. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3406.64s)]
*  And I guess like, I don't know, I guess because of the world that I'm in, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3410.72s)]
*  which is like totally removed from the world of power, you know, like I've never been in DC [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3415.68s)]
*  and I've never been in, you know, and I'm like in, I'm in comedy clubs and then just doing podcasts [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3422.24s)]
*  on the internet. So I guess I feel a little bit removed from the threat as like my profile's [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3428.56s)]
*  gotten bigger. It's something I think about more. I just, I don't know. I kind of like can't stop. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3434.24s)]
*  I'm just, I don't know. Listen, man, if it ever really came down, like if my kids were ever [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3443.52s)]
*  threatened, you could, by the way, it's anybody, CIA, if you're listening or whatever, I would, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3448.64s)]
*  I would protect them first and foremost. I would totally, you know, whatever I had to do, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3452.48s)]
*  I would do that. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3456.4s)]
*  Daddy's going to shut up now. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3457.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. If I ever felt like that was really the threat or my wife for, you know, for that [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3458.16s)]
*  matter. But I do just think that it's something that's kind of hard to describe that what I do [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3463.52s)]
*  is this is my calling in life. It's just what I'm supposed to do. And my greatest heroes, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3470.08s)]
*  all of them at first and foremost, I was talking to you about before is Ron Paul. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3475.6s)]
*  And he always just told the truth, even when it was like something that would get him boot [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3479.92s)]
*  out of an arena or something that would be like very controversial and that would make him look [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3483.44s)]
*  bad. That was just his thing. And those are the people I admire, you know? And I feel like you [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3487.12s)]
*  do that. It's something I admire about you. I feel like Joe does that. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3492.0s)]
*  So it doesn't matter, but you've got to wonder like the Epstein, I did not take the Epstein [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3495.2799999999997s)]
*  murder, which it was a murder, not a suicide seriously at all. And then, you know, I spent a [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3500.24s)]
*  lot of time learning about it and talking to his brother, Mark, about it. And I think becoming [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3506.4s)]
*  something of an expert on it and he was murdered. And so, but then you have to think, well, he was [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  murdered not in his bedroom or on West 57th street. He was killed in the special housing unit of [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3514.08s)]
*  Federal Lockup in Manhattan, like the most, like the inner sanctum of the vault. So, okay. Then the [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3521.76s)]
*  next, I guess, conclusion would have to be anyone with the power to do that can pretty much do [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3528.8s)]
*  anything in this temporal world, right? So that's a pretty formidable, whoever did that and we can, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3534.88s)]
*  you know, I have theories on it, but can't prove it, but somebody did it. And those are the people [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3540.2400000000002s)]
*  that like, maybe you shouldn't criticize. Right? Yeah. I mean, there's certainly, there's a point [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3544.5600000000004s)]
*  to that. There's also, you know, I also, you know, it's saying like having little kids, like I also, [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3550.4s)]
*  I have a son and I do feel an enormous pressure to be an example for him and to be a man. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3556.1600000000003s)]
*  There's a pressure I never felt until I had a son. Maybe that's the sexist in me. I mean, I just [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3566.88s)]
*  didn't feel that same pressure with my daughter. I said, my wife is also like, she's so great [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3572.48s)]
*  that I always just kind of felt when we, our first was a daughter and I always felt when I had her, [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3579.28s)]
*  I was like, oh, like, I was like, okay, my job is pretty easy. It's very easy because I know, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  first I know she's a great, like role model to her. She's like, it just an unbelievable example of [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3588.5600000000004s)]
*  being a great woman. So she's gotten basically what I have to do is like, you know, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3594.32s)]
*  protect her and provide for her and love her. And that's really comes, actually comes very natural. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3598.1600000000003s)]
*  You're not teaching your daughter how to become a woman. Right. Exactly. Not your job. And then [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3602.2400000000002s)]
*  when we had a son, it like kind of hit me like, oh, I have to teach him how to be a man. So [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3606.56s)]
*  I better figure out how to be a man real quick and then I can teach this to my boy. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3613.68s)]
*  That's exactly right. But I think one of the foundational things about being a good man is [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3618.48s)]
*  telling the truth. And even when there's some risk involved in that, so I do also feel like kind of a [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3623.2799999999997s)]
*  pressure that it's like, well, no, then those are the people that are exactly who I should be [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3628.64s)]
*  criticizing and talking about. Now, as far as, you know, I'll, I would just say my only pushback on [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3632.0s)]
*  what you said is that it's not what, yes, they can touch someone in, you know, a secure prison. So [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3640.96s)]
*  that's certainly something they demonstrate. They have the ability to do. Also, I don't know that it [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3647.2s)]
*  was ever supposed to get to that point. And I don't know that we're supposed to know about it. And [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3651.68s)]
*  we're supposed to be having this conversation right now. So clearly it didn't go exactly according [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3654.72s)]
*  to plan. Right. So that's a smart point. So that's the kind of silver lining in all of it. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3658.88s)]
*  We hear a lot from viewers about big tech censorship and those reports are more frequent than ever right [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3664.7200000000003s)]
*  now. Censorship meaning shutting down your access to information, not lies or misinformation, but [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3670.8s)]
*  true things. It's only the truth that they censor. Facts that get in the way of the lies are trying [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3677.36s)]
*  to tell you the net effect of this of course is interfering in the 2024 presidential elections. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3683.36s)]
*  That's why they're censoring more than ever now because the stakes are even higher. You're probably [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3689.52s)]
*  not shocked by this, but the specific examples of it do throw you back a little bit. We've seen [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3692.88s)]
*  screenshots and videos showing how we Google search learn more about the attempted assassination on [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3698.56s)]
*  Donald Trump. Instead, push users to information on Harry Truman or Bob Marley or the Pope, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3703.6s)]
*  anything other than the relevant truth, which is that they just shot Trump in the face. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3710.16s)]
*  They don't want you to know that because it might help Trump. We've seen examples where Facebook [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3716.24s)]
*  marked true photos of a bloodied and defiant Trump as misleading. Somehow those pictures were a lie [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3720.48s)]
*  and then limited their visibility. It's AI assistant explicitly denied the shooting ever took place. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3726.08s)]
*  This is insanity, but it's at the core of big tech's editorial policy, which is denying the [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3730.96s)]
*  truth to you in order to control the outcome of this presidential election. It's not democracy. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3736.48s)]
*  We've seen examples where a generic search for information about Donald Trump was automatically [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3741.52s)]
*  rephrased to show positive stories about Kamala Harris. Instead, is there any clear example of [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3745.92s)]
*  election interference? So what do you do about it? Well, parlor has been down this road. Parlor's [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3752.32s)]
*  pulled right off the internet for telling the truth, but it's back and it's reaffirmed its [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3760.2400000000002s)]
*  lifelong unwavering commitment to free speech on parlor. The bill of rights lives. The first [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3765.36s)]
*  amendment is real. You can say what you think because you're a human being and an American [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3771.52s)]
*  citizen and not a slave on parlor users can freely express themselves, tell the truth, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3775.28s)]
*  express their conscience and connect with others who are doing the same and they will not be [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3781.04s)]
*  interfered with. They will not be censored. Designed to support a wide range of viewpoints. Everyone [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3785.04s)]
*  is welcome on parlor. Parlor is committed to ensuring that everybody is heard. And so it's [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3791.44s)]
*  become a place where independent journalism journalism is protected and respected. It's [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3796.32s)]
*  protected because it's respected. So is this censorship by big tech intensifies standing up [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3800.96s)]
*  for your God given right as an American to say what you think is essential. We're on power. That's [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3807.2000000000003s)]
*  why we're on parlor. Our handle is at Tucker Carlson and we encourage you to join us there. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3813.6800000000003s)]
*  You have the right to say what you believe. So does every American and you can do it on parlor. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3818.8799999999997s)]
*  Get the parlor app today. So if you're trying to figure out what the U.S. will look like [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3823.92s)]
*  next year, 2026 and into the future, worst case is kind of what's happening in the UK right now, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3830.72s)]
*  it seems like. Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty bad. Well, people getting arrested were Facebook posts. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3837.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. And this is why like, you know, people, especially particularly like the dissidents that [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3845.2799999999997s)]
*  that I was talking about, like you really got to be smart in the way that you fight these things. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3851.2799999999997s)]
*  And so, you know, like I, I was talking about when there was, there was one, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3857.7599999999998s)]
*  one of Donald Trump's like trials, there was a big like kind of group of Trump supporters who [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3864.08s)]
*  were outside protesting. And I, I remember I tweeted that day and I was like, Hey, dear Trump [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3870.24s)]
*  supporters, if you happen to see a barrel chested man outside screaming, storm the courthouse, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3876.08s)]
*  just go ahead and don't storm the courthouse. It's like, let's just like, let's be smart about [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3882.24s)]
*  the way you try to go about this. That's right. You do not, this is an asymmetrical conflict. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3887.3599999999997s)]
*  You do not want, you know, a conflict. You do not want to, you don't want a conflict in the sense of [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3891.8399999999997s)]
*  like, let's, let's storm the Capitol. How's that going to work out for you? Okay. No, this is just [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3898.88s)]
*  going to be the excuse now, of course, which obviously the thing was an inside job to a large [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3903.84s)]
*  degree. Can we establish that anybody who screamed, let's storm the Capitol, I can think of two people [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3910.0s)]
*  who did, who was not arrested, didn't spend time in jail, was defended by Democrats in the Congress. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3914.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes. But he, he, and he wasn't alone as another prominent person who did that as well, as I know, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3921.76s)]
*  you know, didn't get arrested, didn't go to jail. I mean, what can we conclude from that? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3926.56s)]
*  Yes. And all of the, and, and just, you know, the, the, the stuff where you, you interviewed the head [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3932.96s)]
*  of- Steve Sund. Yeah, right. And so, I mean, all, just all of the things together, you can kind of [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3939.12s)]
*  obviously see what it was. But that, so you don't want, you don't want a riot. You don't want to do [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3943.92s)]
*  things like that, because then that would be an excuse for our government to do exactly what the, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3951.92s)]
*  the government in the UK is doing right now, right? It was crack down on Facebook posts or whatever, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3956.0s)]
*  you know? And so you don't want to fight it that way. But, you know, the, I do believe like this, [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3960.56s)]
*  this country can still be saved or it could be a lot less worse than the possibilities are. The, [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3968.56s)]
*  the country's been in very bad points before, not exactly the same as where we are right now. What's, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3975.28s)]
*  what's, what's scary about the current position is that it's, it's all of these factors plus [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3981.28s)]
*  the like financial realities. They, they kind of create this weird super storm of things where [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3986.88s)]
*  it's a cultural phenomenon, a political phenomenon, and then it's also just like a debt and, and [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=3994.0s)]
*  derivatives and bonds and like things that are like all completely unsustainable. But I do think [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4000.96s)]
*  that like, like I was saying, like there's, we have a big opportunity if we could really just [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4006.8s)]
*  focus and kind of get people who we have these giant platforms like this show, it's really [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4012.1600000000003s)]
*  incredible. I, I don't think you can overstate how amazing it is that like the dynamics have shifted [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4018.0800000000004s)]
*  technologically and culturally to the point where say someone like, okay, so Bill O'Reilly, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4025.6800000000003s)]
*  obviously a very different person than you and was never, was never a critic of the regime in [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4032.16s)]
*  the meaningful way that you were at Fox news, but he was the number one cable news show at the 8 PM [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4039.12s)]
*  hour at Fox news and they fired him and he largely went away. I know he's still got his show. He's [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4047.12s)]
*  still got a little bit of an audience, but he's not really involved in the national conversation [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4053.92s)]
*  anymore. Like Bill O'Reilly was like moving the national conversation at one point. Like his [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4059.44s)]
*  opinion was going to, was going to have significant influence over a large portion and they were able [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4065.36s)]
*  to like get rid of him. You on the other hand, were the number one show on Fox and cable news, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4071.04s)]
*  the 8 PM hour, they go, we're going to do the same thing to you. And you're like many times bigger [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4078.48s)]
*  than you were at Fox. That's a crazy thing. That's like that signals something is totally [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4083.7599999999998s)]
*  different about the dynamics. Well, that's primarily a technology change, I think. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4089.3599999999997s)]
*  That's certainly a big part of it. That now there was, it's also probably has something to do with [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4093.44s)]
*  you having a younger audience than him because Bill O'Reilly's audience was much older and it's [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4100.32s)]
*  much tougher to get that audience to go over to the internet. I think that's right. They just [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4104.96s)]
*  don't understand it as much. It's a different moment and television is just, it's obviously on [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4109.28s)]
*  its way out anyway. So that my timing was not that I was in charge of it, but it was turned out to be [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4115.28s)]
*  good. No, I mean, obviously look, a lot of it was things that you were in control of. A lot of it [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4120.16s)]
*  was things that you weren't mostly not in control of. But the fact that we've got these kind of like [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4124.08s)]
*  alternative platforms now, which it really aren't even alternative. I mean, this is kind of the [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4130.639999999999s)]
*  mainstream. You know what I mean? It's not Brian Stelter ain't the mainstream. You know what I mean? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4135.44s)]
*  It's like, so it's you and Rogan and Candice Owen's show is like taken off and there's all these like [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4140.639999999999s)]
*  big shows. And so, okay, we've got a new tool in our disposal here. And it's like part of the thing [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4146.4s)]
*  that's so frustrating to me, which watching Trump's campaign so far is it's like, I don't know who he [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4155.839999999999s)]
*  has running this thing, but it is not, it does not have the brilliance that Steve Bannon had [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4162.56s)]
*  in 2016 where they really figured out like, this is the lane you run in and you're and there's so [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4168.0s)]
*  many things about. And so anyway, I guess what I'm saying is that like these audiences may need to [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4175.76s)]
*  pressure Donald Trump right now to be better and to run a smarter campaign. So if you're Trump, [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4180.96s)]
*  what do you run on right now? Well, okay. So first of all, it's like you understand that the whole [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4186.400000000001s)]
*  appeal of Donald Trump was that he was a giant middle finger to the establishment who's failed [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4192.08s)]
*  on everything. There was a reason why people wanted a big middle finger to them because they [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4198.64s)]
*  failed on everything. And just, just look at in the 21st century alone, what has the ruling elite [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4203.04s)]
*  handed the American people? I mean, like they failed on 9-11. They then used 9-11 to fight a bunch [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4210.32s)]
*  of wars they already wanted to fight that were catastrophic. Just absolutely disastrous. They [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4218.4s)]
*  used it to oppress their own population. Yes. They stripped us of all types of basic liberties [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4224.5599999999995s)]
*  that we took from the. Humiliating us at the airport. That's right. Yeah. Then they handed [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4229.759999999999s)]
*  us the greatest financial recession in a hundred years. They gave us the Obama recovery, which was [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4234.0s)]
*  like the most crony recovery built off 0% interest rates and record high government spending. So the [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4243.2s)]
*  recovery essentially was Wall Street and the suburbs of Washington, DC. Then there's the rise [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4252.24s)]
*  of wokeism, all this insane stuff that they're pushing on people. Now they've given us this [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4259.04s)]
*  disastrous war in Ukraine, all this stuff, right? They literally created COVID. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4264.48s)]
*  They made. And then stripped us of our civil liberties in the name of fighting something [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4272.240000000001s)]
*  that they created in a lab with our supposed enemy, China. Like what? Yes. They, right, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4276.160000000001s)]
*  they created the thing. Yes. It allowed, and I don't mean intentionally because I don't actually [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4282.400000000001s)]
*  think that's the case. Who knows? Oh, I'm not suggesting that. Who knows? But they allowed the [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4287.6s)]
*  conditions for this to happen. 100%. Yeah. And then used that to have the biggest crackdown on [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4291.4400000000005s)]
*  the liberties of the American people in our, in our nation's history. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4297.52s)]
*  They, and all on the basis of pseudoscience, it was all completely wrong. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4302.080000000001s)]
*  Okay. So they've given all of us. So like the lane here is that you, Donald Trump, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4318.56s)]
*  represent the repudiation of all of that. And that's how you won in 2016, obviously pre COVID, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4324.88s)]
*  but that's how you won in 2016. You were a repudiation of the bushes and the Clintons, [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4330.72s)]
*  not just the Clintons, not just the, the Democrat establishment, but also the last [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4335.2s)]
*  Republican president. You got on stage and said, he lied us into war. I mean, like this is what [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4340.64s)]
*  gave you that energy this year in the campaign. I mean, look how, however you feel about Israel, [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4345.68s)]
*  the fact that Donald Trump has made the whole campaign, you know, his convention is the pro [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4353.52s)]
*  Israel convention. And then it's like, Oh, Kamala Harris, you're a, she's a Palestinian. Chuck Schumer [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4358.72s)]
*  is a Palestinian. They're all a bunch of left. It's like, well now what you're supporting the [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4364.4800000000005s)]
*  status quo, which is that America supports Israel. That's what every powerful person in DC believes. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4368.16s)]
*  All of them, including Kamala Harris, by the way, who's a part of an administration that is [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4373.84s)]
*  completely supporting Israel's war in Gaza right now. Like, what do you, what is this weird [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4379.76s)]
*  invention? And then he even frames it as there are all these left-wing socialists, you know, [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4384.88s)]
*  they're all the like, so he's almost like putting himself in the position as the defender of the [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4390.4800000000005s)]
*  establishment against the radicals who would overthrow the establishment and what have a [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4395.6s)]
*  revolution of the workers or something like that. It's none of this is first off, it's not true. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4401.2s)]
*  That's not at all what's going on. They're the defenders of the establishment. Yes, [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4405.92s)]
*  they use some left-wing rhetoric to pit people against each other and create a culture war to [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4409.84s)]
*  distract from their terrible policies, but they're not Marxists. This is so ridiculous. You know what [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4415.04s)]
*  I mean? And so like, first of all, look, Donald Trump, I'm not saying it's painful to hear this [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4421.04s)]
*  because it's so true. Well, look, I'm not saying you have to come out. You don't have to be me. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4425.76s)]
*  Okay. And you don't, it's just objectively true. Well, you shouldn't be me by the way, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4429.68s)]
*  because if you were saying what I think, it probably wouldn't get you elected. You know [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4433.6s)]
*  what I mean? You can come out there and say, we love Israel. We will always defend Israel. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4438.08s)]
*  Israel is a great country, but we're not funding aggressive wars around the country. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4443.52s)]
*  What does that have to do with anything? I don't see why it's even relevant. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4450.64s)]
*  But if you want to be the anti-establishment guy, you can't take the establishment position. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4455.280000000001s)]
*  So that's where you're speaking the deepest level of truth, in my opinion. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4459.280000000001s)]
*  You are not the incumbent. The incumbents have wrecked the country. I mean, off the cliff is not [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4462.96s)]
*  too strong a metaphor for what they're doing. And you're opposing that. So hoist the middle finger. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4468.88s)]
*  You're opposed to that. You are not on the side of the establishment. I don't understand why. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4474.72s)]
*  That's just not hard. I put that on the refrigerator and meditate on it every day. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4478.72s)]
*  Well, I also will say one of the things that was kind of magical about [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4482.56s)]
*  Trump's 2016 campaign, which really, I mean, it just, it can't be overstated how amazing [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4487.759999999999s)]
*  what he did was, however you feel about him. And the guy on a shoestring budget went out there and [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4493.2s)]
*  just through use of social media and his kind of bombastic personality was able to completely [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4500.0s)]
*  dominate the news cycle and took out the Bushes and the Clintons, the two most powerful political [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4506.32s)]
*  families in modern American history. He took both of them out in this crazy upset. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4513.44s)]
*  And part of the way that he did that was that there were these issues that were like [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4519.36s)]
*  overwhelmingly popular that no one else wanted to touch. It's like, it was like if there was like a [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4525.12s)]
*  poker game and there was just like pocket aces that like everyone's like, I don't want those cards. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4532.5599999999995s)]
*  And then Donald Trump was like, I'll play those cards. Those are very good cards. I'll play. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4539.44s)]
*  How about build a wall and stop the flood of illegal immigration? Like how about we can have [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4544.879999999999s)]
*  immigration, but like we get to decide who comes in and does it because it's wildly popular with [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4550.24s)]
*  people. Open borders aren't popular. I mean, it's hard to even find polling on them because [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4554.4s)]
*  it's so unpopular that people won't even ask the question. Like they ask like, do you want [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4559.919999999999s)]
*  higher levels of immigration or lower level? But the only polls I've seen, it's like [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4563.839999999999s)]
*  single digits, you know, maybe 7% of people support open borders and maybe less than that. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4568.24s)]
*  But so he had to just plainly say, Hey, we shouldn't fight stupid wars. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4574.32s)]
*  That turns out that's a wildly popular position. However, I will say with this, you know, the [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4577.92s)]
*  majority of Americans don't want to support Israel's war in Gaza, but he won't play that card [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4584.16s)]
*  for whatever reason. Maybe it's because he believes it. Maybe it's because Jared Kushner convinced [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4590.08s)]
*  him of this or maybe it's, I don't know, but he's not going to play that card and just say, Hey, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4594.4s)]
*  we're broke here. We're $35 trillion in debt. That's right. We can't afford to prop up other. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4599.839999999999s)]
*  Listen, when I'm like a strict non-interventionist, I'm like John Quincy Adams. I don't think America [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4607.2s)]
*  should fight anything. If we're attacked, we destroy those people, but that's essentially it. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4613.04s)]
*  You know, but when a couple months ago, when Iran in response to Israel, [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4616.96s)]
*  killing an Iranian, it, when they launched those missiles at, at Israel and a team of nations led [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4625.12s)]
*  by the United States all helped defend Israel. It was a Jordan and Saudi Arabia were involved [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4632.08s)]
*  too, by the way, which kind of goes to show you the real dynamics of that region. But no one's [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4637.12s)]
*  really complaining about that. Like, okay, fine. I'm a non-interventionist, but like if missiles [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4643.36s)]
*  are coming toward Israel, go ahead, shoot them down. Fine. That doesn't mean we have to help them. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4647.28s)]
*  That doesn't mean we have to fund them fighting their war. And then also just the fact that like [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4651.36s)]
*  there's a foreign country, we're not allowed to criticize and people's careers get ruined [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4656.799999999999s)]
*  over that. This is, I'm sorry. Listen, if you want to be America first, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4660.88s)]
*  what does America first mean? Right? It means we shouldn't have fought the war in Iraq or whatever [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4667.28s)]
*  something. Okay. Who really wanted us to fight the war in Iraq? You know, I'm just saying it's [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4671.36s)]
*  like, no, like, like all these guys and it's like, they come back in now with the NatCon movement. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4676.5599999999995s)]
*  Douglas Colonel McGregor had a great article about this earlier this summer. He co-authored it in the [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4683.44s)]
*  American conservative, but it's like all this new NatCon movement that has all this kind of like pro [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4688.08s)]
*  Israel stuff coming into it. It's, it's the title of the piece is a neoconservatism by another name. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4692.96s)]
*  It was a great piece. Everybody should go read it. But it's like, well, who do you think the [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4698.48s)]
*  neocons were who wanted us to fight the war in Iraq? Like I said last time on here, go read a [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4704.16s)]
*  clean break, a new strategy for securing the realm by Richard Pearl and David Wormser. It was about [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4709.36s)]
*  overthrowing Saddam Hussein for Israel's benefit. Like I'm not against Israel. I'm Jewish. I like [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4714.48s)]
*  Israel. It's a cool country. The people there are great. I'm just saying that if you're America [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4720.0s)]
*  first, then the guy, Benjamin Netanyahu, the guy who testifies before Congress that we should go [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4724.32s)]
*  overthrow Saddam Hussein and launch a regime change war against Iran and launch a war in Libya. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4729.36s)]
*  That's not your ally. The whole America first thing is that we don't think we should go fight [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4734.48s)]
*  all of these stupid wars. Unless they help us. Right, right. You know, unless there's some [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4739.12s)]
*  coherent justification for them at least. But so, okay. So Donald Trump, he needs to just play. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4743.28s)]
*  There's a few things that he could laser focus on right now. And he should, Donald Trump should [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4749.36s)]
*  be asking himself the question that Hillary Clinton asked herself in 2016, the most obnoxious [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4755.12s)]
*  question ever. But why are you not up by 50 points right now? Donald Trump, why is that? [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4760.48s)]
*  Oh, listen, no, just run on this. No more stupid wars, period. We're not fighting any wars of [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4766.88s)]
*  choice. We are only fighting wars of necessity, which we do not have any right now. Iran, [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4774.32s)]
*  puny little Iran is a threat to the United States of America. Give me a fucking break. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4780.4s)]
*  It's absurd. Come on. This is too ridiculous. And he should, if anyone should, he should have [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4786.16s)]
*  the courage to say that. But there's no pushback from anyone. Well, that's what I'm saying. On [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4790.24s)]
*  the question of going to war with Iran. So if you have a highly motivated force pushing for something [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4793.28s)]
*  and there's no organized resistance to it, that force will prevail. And what I see is a bipartisan [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4801.52s)]
*  push, Republican and Democrat push toward war with Iran. No even attempt to explain why this [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4808.4800000000005s)]
*  is in my interest, why I should send my four draft days children to go die in Iran. Not even a [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4814.4800000000005s)]
*  conversation about that. So I feel like unless I'm missing something, we're going to get that war. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4819.4400000000005s)]
*  Well, they you know, the the problem at least, it's been a while since I read this, but [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4825.04s)]
*  Scott Horton, who's totally brilliant, you should have him on man. He's a, he was like [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4832.0s)]
*  Justin Ramondo's disciple. Just like he's, he's anti war.com. And he's just like, IQ off the [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4838.4s)]
*  charts. He wrote the book enough already, which is about the book about the terror, the war on [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4845.92s)]
*  terror from Jimmy Carter all the way through Donald Trump. And he's, he's currently writing [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4851.2s)]
*  a book on the war in Ukraine, which I got an advanced copy of his phenomenal. I can't wait [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4857.36s)]
*  to send this to you when it comes out. It's so good. It's called provoked. And it's just the [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4861.679999999999s)]
*  whole story of how at every turn, the West, the war with Ukraine. So good. I really can't wait for [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4865.92s)]
*  that to come out and people to read it. But you know, what stopped the war in Iran, the first time [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4872.24s)]
*  was really the military when, when Dick Cheney wanted it and George W. I think George W. Bush [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4878.08s)]
*  eventually like was like, I've been listening to this guy too much. This was like by 2017, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4883.44s)]
*  he had finally figured out like, let me stop listening to Dick Cheney because it's just, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4887.84s)]
*  you know, but, but it was really the military. It was just like logistics. Like they were just [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4892.16s)]
*  like, guys, we do not have escalation dominance against Iran. We like they, yes, we we're not [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4896.8s)]
*  going to lose the war, but like they can target so many American bases over there. It's just going [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4902.32s)]
*  to be a bloodbath. Like this isn't, you know, there was one green beret who told me off camera, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4907.84s)]
*  but he told me he goes, this isn't like 10 times harder than fighting a war in Iraq. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4913.4400000000005s)]
*  Fighting a war in Iran is a thousand times harder. This is a whole different ballgame. So perhaps that [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4918.24s)]
*  reality will, will stop it from happening. But even just like, even just the rhetoric about like [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4923.76s)]
*  being tough on them. It's like, why, why are we even talking like this? Why are we constantly [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4931.52s)]
*  trying to escalate here? It's so simple and it's popular with the American people. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4938.08s)]
*  No more stupid wars. Look, even, even the, the one of the amazing things in how much [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4943.280000000001s)]
*  Munich and right, right. I mean, Chamberlain, there I go again, being Neville Chamberlain, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4948.64s)]
*  the only lesson of history ever is Neville Chamberlain. You're always right. If you're on [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4955.76s)]
*  the side of aggression, you know, but never if you're talking about, of course, of course, [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4959.76s)]
*  right. Or the history of the war at all. So they always tell you it's the most important election [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4964.0s)]
*  of your lifetime, but of course this one actually is that's demonstrable. And it's also because it [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4968.4800000000005s)]
*  is so important being censored at every level by the tech companies. So we were thinking about this [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4973.52s)]
*  a couple of months ago and we thought, why not get on the road live in front of actual people, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4978.0s)]
*  live audiences, coast to coast and nationwide tour where we can't be censored. That'd be good. It [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4982.72s)]
*  would also be fun. So we're doing it. We're going to be on stage with some of our friends, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4988.64s)]
*  some of the most fascinating people we know, the most recognizable people we know, responding to [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4992.08s)]
*  what is happening in America this September in real time. It'll be just like the podcast, [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=4996.4800000000005s)]
*  but it's going to be live. So we're excited to announce our friend Larry Elder is coming to join [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5002.56s)]
*  us in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Our friend John Rich will be there with us in Sunrise, Florida. We're [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5007.4400000000005s)]
*  adding more stops. You just added another stadium show in Reading, Pennsylvania. We'll be joined on [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5012.320000000001s)]
*  stage by Alex Jones. They tell you what Alex Jones is like. Have you seen him in person? You should [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5017.36s)]
*  make up your own mind. It's going to be fun as hell and interesting and intense. And we hope [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5022.32s)]
*  you will join us. Go to tuckercarlson.com right now to get your tickets. See you there. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5027.759999999999s)]
*  Um, but like, but one of the things that's really interesting, that's changed very drastically in a [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5032.96s)]
*  short period of time on the kind of the right in America is that at least what I get now, [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5037.759999999999s)]
*  the talking point for Donald Trump, like from Donald Trump supporters is that, um, there were [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5043.84s)]
*  no new wars. He didn't start any new wars, which is, I do love that that's the talking point. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5049.2s)]
*  Like it's never like he killed all the terrorists or he was so tough where the Democrats are wimpy. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5055.2s)]
*  His supporters are bragging that he didn't get us into a new war. Now, [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5060.88s)]
*  okay. I, you know, the reality is that like came pretty close actually in Iran and Venezuela. He [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5065.4400000000005s)]
*  really flirted with new wars. And he didn't end the wars that he said he was going to end. And [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5071.92s)]
*  so there's some criticism, but it's kind of like, look, this is what your own supporters like about [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5077.4400000000005s)]
*  you. So just run on that. And then the other thing, man, that he feels it too. He feels it. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5082.0s)]
*  I mean, one thing I can say about Trump, having talked to him about this a lot is that that is [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5087.4400000000005s)]
*  sincere. He is afraid of nuclear war. And I think his instincts are correct on war in general. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5092.4800000000005s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. What's in it for us? Like, what's the point? And he's also the only [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5098.96s)]
*  leader I've ever talked to in my life at that level who routinely says, well, people get killed. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5103.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I'm not saying he's a, you know, super faithful Christian or whatever. I don't know [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5109.68s)]
*  where that instinct comes from, but it's totally real. I've heard him say it many times. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5115.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5119.44s)]
*  People die and they've got widows and kids and stuff. It's a big deal to kill people. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5119.84s)]
*  No, you're right. He's one of the only people like at that level. I mean, I've heard like [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5123.6s)]
*  some anti-war leftists. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5128.88s)]
*  Well, I think that, but I'm not, I have no power. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5130.08s)]
*  Yeah. But like at that level of political power, it's yeah, it's like you'd never hear that. Like, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5132.48s)]
*  that's never even a part of the calculation. It seems. And even when Trump was being manipulated [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5136.16s)]
*  by some very not good people that he had around him, like when the, to strike Syria, it does seem [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5142.0s)]
*  like most of the reporting was that that's how they got them was with being like, look at these [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5148.16s)]
*  dead kids from these chemical attacks. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5152.799999999999s)]
*  Oh, the fake poison gas. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5154.48s)]
*  Yeah. And then just, you know, and so kind of like played on that feeling that he has to be like, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5155.84s)]
*  you know, you got to do something to stop this. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5161.360000000001s)]
*  So one of the reasons nobody pushes back against the big picture claims that, you know, for example, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5162.56s)]
*  Iran is her greatest enemy or that Putin is going to try and overrun Czechoslovakia or this is [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5167.92s)]
*  freaking insane. Is that anyone who talks like that puts himself at risk. And I would just, [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5173.280000000001s)]
*  you know, Scott Ritter, I'm sure you saw this week at the FBI rated as how, you know, this is a former [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5179.360000000001s)]
*  arms inspector, us government employee who's been opposing American foreign policy nonviolently for [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5185.2s)]
*  20 years and they keep throwing him in jail for it. No one cares. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5192.16s)]
*  Well, there is, yeah, there's, there's risks that are attached to opposing the war machine. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5196.5599999999995s)]
*  Cause that's, that's kind of the whole game. And so look, I, I also do recognize that like, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5202.32s)]
*  I'm just, you know, talking shit into a microphone in that Donald Trump, the, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5210.72s)]
*  the pressures and the forces that he has to deal with here are certainly things that I [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5217.04s)]
*  don't completely understand. But from what I do understand of this is that I know it's the [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5221.4400000000005s)]
*  correct position and it would be enormously popular with his base. And then there's other [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5229.360000000001s)]
*  things too, that he should be laser focused on. I mean, obviously immigration. I mean, this is, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5234.4800000000005s)]
*  it's unbelievable, unbelievable that what he decided was his signature issue that he ran his [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5239.44s)]
*  campaign centered around has been basically has won the day and that that he was, he was labeled [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5246.639999999999s)]
*  a Nazi for this. And now you got the, the mayors in blue sanctuary cities, all talking about how [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5255.679999999999s)]
*  the influx of migrants is destroying their cities and stuff. So he's got a forever. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5263.919999999999s)]
*  He's obviously got pocket aces right there that you play this card. And the other thing [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5268.72s)]
*  is the censorship, which really should be more of a focus of his campaign. And I'm, [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5275.04s)]
*  I'm stunned that it's not like he, I mean, he's back on Twitter today, by the way. I've mentioned [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5280.64s)]
*  that to you in first. I just saw that on my way over here in the taxi. He's back on Twitter. So [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5285.76s)]
*  yeah, it has to be back on Twitter to win this thing. But like he got kicked off of Twitter and, [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5289.92s)]
*  and not just him, he shouldn't make it just about him. He should, that should almost be like an [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5296.08s)]
*  afterthought, you know, for his campaign, but like all of his supporters, you know, like it's in his [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5300.96s)]
*  self interest to defend these guys with everybody through 2020. I mean, if you were like critical [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5307.04s)]
*  of the lockdowns, you're there's, everybody was getting silenced left and right. And that is, [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5312.4s)]
*  he should make this campaign like a referendum on free speech. And that the only way free speech [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5318.24s)]
*  is going to happen is when I'm in there and he should threaten the shit out of all of these [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5325.84s)]
*  companies. He should, you know, Facebook backed off like Nikita Khrushchev level. We will bury you. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5332.0s)]
*  Yes, that's right. And, and not, and cause Khrushchev didn't even mean it. Like with force, [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5337.92s)]
*  he meant, he meant like their economic model was going to be better. No, I want force. I mean, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5342.8s)]
*  with force, we should listen, it is, that is the only thing these companies are going to respond [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5347.360000000001s)]
*  to. But if they think that Donald Trump, like if Donald Trump is really sad in a believable way, [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5352.32s)]
*  like he'd say, Hey, Google, I'm, I'm going to win this election, which look, as of right now, [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5358.08s)]
*  there's at least a very good chance he's going to win this election. And he goes, my sole mission [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5364.88s)]
*  in life every morning when I wake up till I go to sleep that night is going to be to take you guys [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5369.759999999999s)]
*  down unless you stop censoring right now. Like, I'm not, I don't mean when I get in, I mean, from [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5374.5599999999995s)]
*  now until the election, if you, cause you know, you see all this stuff like Elon Musk was posting [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5380.72s)]
*  about it. It's crazy. We're like, if you search for the shooter, it doesn't come up. The right to a [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5385.12s)]
*  blanket. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Like the latest on Ford's theater. I saw there was a Reagan in [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5390.240000000001s)]
*  our galana Reagan getting shot. And then like, you know, if you search Trump, it goes to these Kamala [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5395.360000000001s)]
*  ads and stuff. I mean, he should be, he should be scaring that, which by the way, they all respond [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5400.08s)]
*  to that. They're scared of government. Well, it's why the censorship regime started to begin with. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5404.4800000000005s)]
*  Of course. Exactly. It didn't exist. Democrats in Congress pushed them into it. Well, they hauled [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5409.52s)]
*  them in front of Congress and threatened all of them. And then they go, okay, yeah, sure. It's so [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5413.76s)]
*  weak. So turns out Fauci has COVID. So someone just texted me and I don't know if this is actually [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5418.4800000000005s)]
*  true, but he had six shots. I mean, which should make sense. I think that's, that's the recommended [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5426.0s)]
*  amount. Yeah. How do you get, if you've been vaccinated six times against something, how do [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5433.6s)]
*  you get it? You should have taken eight, I guess. It's really just always need more, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5438.32s)]
*  always need more vaccines. No, but I mean, it's just kind of to your point, leaving aside the, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5444.5599999999995s)]
*  I think the vaccines. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5448.5599999999995s)]
*  I never got vaxxed. Not to brag. I hate to rub that in people's faces because I'm obviously [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5462.16s)]
*  very proud of it on my greatest achievements, but I got COVID once. I've been super healthy [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5467.2s)]
*  ever since then. I never washed my hands, never wear a mask. I'm like the dirtiest person you've [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5472.5599999999995s)]
*  ever met. I'm happy to breathe the breath of strangers on crowded commercial flights. Like, [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5477.2s)]
*  and I never got COVID again. Here's Fauci's had three times. Biden keeps getting it. Like, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5482.48s)]
*  what is that? Why does nobody say anything about this? Yeah. Well, same, same with me. Never got [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5486.639999999999s)]
*  the vax. I had COVID twice and you know, it's mildly sick and it was, I would have rather not. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5490.32s)]
*  But like whatever it's fine. And then I know so many people who, who got it and some of whom [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5497.6s)]
*  had the same experience as me, got COVID a few times and just were mildly sick. A lot of them [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5504.56s)]
*  got it several more times than I did. And then [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5511.200000000001s)]
*  and what we can say with 100% certainty is that the thing was sold on lies and not just like, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5527.12s)]
*  oh, they got it wrong. Like they, they were totally, there was never any evidence to suggest [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5535.76s)]
*  that you could not get COVID or transmit COVID. You know, even in the original, [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5542.160000000001s)]
*  what was it? The Pfizer study where I think like it was, if I'm remembering this correctly, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5546.8s)]
*  it's been a while since I read it, but I think it was like in the unvaccinated group, two people [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5552.48s)]
*  died of COVID and in the vaccinated group, one person died of COVID. And then they extrapolated [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5557.599999999999s)]
*  from that, that it's 100%, you know, reduction, but there was still a person who died of it in [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5562.32s)]
*  there. This idea that you can't die. Like this was never true. They lied through their teeth. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5567.28s)]
*  And Joe Biden, the beginning of his administration made his number one priority to by any means [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5572.719999999999s)]
*  necessary, get every single American to take this vaccine. And luckily it, with our like, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5579.2s)]
*  the skeleton of constitutional limited Republic, you know, like procedures that we still have, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5587.04s)]
*  the Supreme court struck down the worst of, of his mandates, like the OSHA mandate, which would have [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5593.5199999999995s)]
*  had every midsize and large business in America have to fire anyone who was unvaccinated. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5599.12s)]
*  All the people that got fired, they've been made whole. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5604.88s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm sure they haven't. And that's, yeah. Man, I mean, like I know we live in so much stuff [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5607.04s)]
*  happened so quickly that I know going like four years ago or three years ago, seems like ancient [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5613.839999999999s)]
*  history, but if nothing else, I mean, on that alone, the Democrats deserve to lose all power [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5618.4s)]
*  that they have, but they went all in on that and a lot of Republicans too. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5624.08s)]
*  So Rogan, who I just want to say for the record, I really love and I revere as a, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5627.5199999999995s)]
*  as a pioneer in media really more than, I mean, Roger Ailes level kind of changed everything. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5633.68s)]
*  Yeah. I just always want to say that because I really believe it. But he seemed to [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5639.5199999999995s)]
*  endorse Bobby Kennedy. Then he comes out and says, no, I was just, I just liked Bobby Kennedy. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5645.44s)]
*  I liked Bobby Kennedy too, for the record. He's a nice man, but I was not endorsing him. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5650.16s)]
*  Rogan said, and I don't really like talking about politics that much. I'm summarizing, [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5655.76s)]
*  but if you want to know what I think, just listen to Dave. That was kind of funny and cool that he [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5661.2s)]
*  said that, but give us your assessment of Bobby Kennedy. What role does he play in this race, if any? [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5667.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, by the way, so when Rogan tweeted that, and I mean, it's just, I couldn't even look on my phone [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5672.88s)]
*  for hours after that because it's just like, and he texted me, it was one of the funniest texts I've [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5680.32s)]
*  ever gotten. Rogan texted me and he goes, oh, I didn't even realize that I stirred up a whole [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5685.12s)]
*  riot on Twitter, but I sent all the looters to your house. Oh, that's pretty good. Which is, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5690.08s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that is really, but I was like, I'll take them. I love this. I like the looters. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5694.8s)]
*  But also the moment really is it's because Joe is such a, like, I know him pretty well. We're like [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5699.2s)]
*  pretty good friends at this point. And he is exactly what you say. Yeah. Like that's him. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5706.88s)]
*  Everybody who, if you watch the show, you already know who he is. So it's like, [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5712.4800000000005s)]
*  he wasn't, he doesn't even think like I'm going to be making an endorsement today on my show about [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5716.4800000000005s)]
*  which candidate I want to throw my people's support behind. He literally just, someone asked him a [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5723.04s)]
*  question and he was just having a moment. Like he was just like, I do like this Bobby Kennedy guy. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5727.28s)]
*  You know, he seems kind of like he's read books about stuff and he wants to discuss ideas and not [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5731.360000000001s)]
*  just like personal attacks. And I really liked that. I agree with that. And yeah, I mean, I kind of, [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5736.0s)]
*  I tend to agree with that too. I also just, by the way, I mean, I was just so furious at Trump [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5741.12s)]
*  supporters who were like giving Rogan shit for that. And then I just thought it was maybe the [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5749.28s)]
*  stupidest thing Trump's done in the campaign so far was that he posted on truth social attacking [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5756.16s)]
*  Joe Rogan for it. And it's like, man, it's any, is anyone around him to just be like, no, you don't [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5762.88s)]
*  go to war with Joe Rogan. No, that's the teachers union. You should be like, what? But it's also [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5769.92s)]
*  like even whether he's supporting you or not, that's your teachers union. You know, he's again, [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5776.56s)]
*  like I said before, it's not left versus right. It's dissident versus the regime. And this is the [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5781.36s)]
*  guy who cracked the corporate meeting. He's the guy who cracked the state's monopoly on information. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5785.68s)]
*  That is true. So come on, what are you doing here? And he said also is just so removed. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5791.4400000000005s)]
*  It's really just the flaw in Trump is that he said it'll be interesting to see how much Joe [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5796.320000000001s)]
*  Rogan gets booed at the next UFC event. And you're like, do you really think Joe Rogan's going to get [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5801.76s)]
*  booed at a U? Okay. All right. I know that Donald Trump, I know how your, your mind works and it's, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5808.72s)]
*  it's, there's great things about it. And then there's things that hold you back. But I know [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5815.12s)]
*  that you think that since they love you at the UFC event, they're your people and they'll hate [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5819.360000000001s)]
*  anybody who is not supporting you, but actually they really love Joe Rogan and they're not going [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5825.04s)]
*  to be booing him. And there's, it was just so stupid to fight this fight with him. Anyway, [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5830.16s)]
*  you know, to the Bobby Kennedy stuff, I was, when he first started running and I had him on my show [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5836.24s)]
*  and I was just like, I just loved the guy. And I thought, you know, his, his positions on Ukraine [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5845.28s)]
*  and on the vaccine, I thought were heroic. And it was amazing. What was so amazing about his campaign [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5853.36s)]
*  was that he was running as a Democrat and he's Bobby Kennedy. Like his name is Bobby Kennedy. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5860.5599999999995s)]
*  And he's not like some, you know, peripheral Kennedy who's like, he's Bobby Kennedy's son. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5868.639999999999s)]
*  He's Jack Kennedy's nephew. And here he is giving Democrats this. It reminded me a lot of the Ron [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5874.96s)]
*  Paul presidential campaigns where, because Ron Paul was such a conservative person and because [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5882.56s)]
*  right after his name, there was our Texas, you know, and he could be against the wars. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5890.320000000001s)]
*  It was like he gave permission for you. You're allowed to be against the wars. You could oppose [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5897.76s)]
*  the wars and you don't have to give up your whole identity. You don't have to be Michael Moore in [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5903.120000000001s)]
*  order to be against this war. You could be a real American patriot and oppose these wars. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5907.04s)]
*  And in a similar fashion, I felt like Bobby Kennedy was giving Democrats permission to abandon [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5912.64s)]
*  these, which were, look, I mean, if you think about it, I said just a second ago that the vaccine was [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5917.92s)]
*  Joe Biden's first, you know, we're all in on the vaccine. And then his second big thing was all in [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5922.48s)]
*  on the war in Ukraine. This is the Biden administration. So he's this total repudiation [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5928.0s)]
*  of Joe Biden, but being like the true Democrat, what we're really supposed to be, you know? [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5933.36s)]
*  And so there was something amazing about his campaign. You know, I understand why he made [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5939.84s)]
*  the move to go independent because there's not a real Democratic process in the Democratic Party. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5945.04s)]
*  Nor is there much of a constituency at this point for that message. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5951.84s)]
*  Yes, that's probably true. I do think that and, you know, me and him, he came back on my podcast [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5954.400000000001s)]
*  to his credit and we argued about this. I do think it's strained our relationship a little bit, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5962.56s)]
*  but I could get past not being good on Israel from my perspective, of course. And I could get past, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5970.320000000001s)]
*  I could probably tolerate all the way up to like Vivek Ramaswamy's position on Israel, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5983.76s)]
*  which essentially was he was like taking the non-interventionist position, but doing it in [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5991.68s)]
*  a way where it's like, I am not picking a fight with AIPAC. You know what I mean? Like he was like, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=5996.56s)]
*  I think his answer to the debate was something he said, he goes, I'll tell Netanyahu that I'm [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6000.8s)]
*  going to kill the terrorists on our southern border and you go kill the terrorists on your [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6005.04s)]
*  southern borders. I was kind of like, I'm not funding your war, but like totally support you [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6009.12s)]
*  doing what you're doing. That's not how I feel about the situation at all. I actually, I think [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6014.72s)]
*  it's really horrible what Israel's doing and it's inexcusable. But I mean, I just going around with [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6018.88s)]
*  Rabbi Shmueli as your campaign advisor, I just like, to me, once I saw that, I was like, I'm just, [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6026.4800000000005s)]
*  I can't, I just can't. It's too much for me. So, and I do think again, kind of like I'm saying [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6033.84s)]
*  with Donald Trump, I mean, he just, pocket aces, you don't want to play these pocket aces. Okay. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6040.08s)]
*  I mean, Democrats, like 70% of Democrats oppose this war and want to cease fire. I think 50% of [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6045.5199999999995s)]
*  them consider it a genocide on the Republican side. Obviously there's a lot of America first [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6053.04s)]
*  people who could be persuaded that we shouldn't be involved in these conflicts. I think Bobby [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6057.919999999999s)]
*  Kennedy had a real chance to make, like if he was non-interventionist on this war, I think he would [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6062.48s)]
*  have made some huge waves and I think that really hurt him. He also, he lost a bunch of people on his [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6068.5599999999995s)]
*  campaign staff because he was the anti-war guy. I had a whole bunch of anti-war people who were [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6074.24s)]
*  like, oh no, I'm not going to be a part of this now. So where does that leave him now? [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6078.96s)]
*  I, as a political matter, it feels like, it feels like there is a significant chunk of people. I [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6084.24s)]
*  don't know how many in the millions though, support Bobby Kennedy, clearly repudiate the priorities [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6092.88s)]
*  of the Biden Harris administration. Don't want to vote for Trump. I mean, my sense is he's taking [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6098.24s)]
*  potential Trump voters. Yeah, that's, that might be the case. You know, I'm not sure exactly. And [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6104.96s)]
*  I don't know. I mean, if, if Donald Trump, like, you know, if he were to drop out of the race and [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6110.4800000000005s)]
*  endorse Donald Trump, I think there's a very good chance he could end up in his cabinet and get some [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6120.0s)]
*  type of position out of it. If Trump were to win for sure. I, I don't know if that's going to happen, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6126.56s)]
*  if he stays in the race the whole time, because I think it will be seen as like, well, no, I mean, [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6131.92s)]
*  you can't, you know, diminishing returns for sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you just can't do that. And [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6137.200000000001s)]
*  then expect the guy to give you a position. Do you think if Bobby Kennedy endorsed Trump, [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6140.96s)]
*  which is possible, I would say it is possible. Do you think that would push Trump over the line? [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6146.240000000001s)]
*  Would that meaningfully help? Most endorsements don't. Would that make a difference? [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6156.88s)]
*  It might. I don't know. You know, it's hard to tell what endorsements, you know, [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6160.160000000001s)]
*  like endorsements actually do anything. It's not, you know, it's just in general in life. It's not [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6163.360000000001s)]
*  like, you know, you see like Obama and Donald Trump, who are two of the most successful political [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6170.8s)]
*  figures in the last, the most successful political figures in the last, you know, 15 years or so. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6178.0s)]
*  And it's not as if their endorsements seem to carry that much weight. It's not like it's not [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6183.68s)]
*  transferable like that in the same sense that like, you know, like I love your show. You were the only [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6188.56s)]
*  guy on cable news who I always watched. And I love watching your show on your new network. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6195.200000000001s)]
*  If you were like, hey, you got to check out this guy, someone else, you got to check out their show. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6202.08s)]
*  That would certainly get me to check it out. But it's not as if that's a guarantee that I'll [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6207.12s)]
*  I'll check it out. And if I like it, then I'll keep watching. It's just, you can't just transfer [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6211.68s)]
*  the thing that people like about you on to other people. I've never said a bad word about Rogan. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6216.72s)]
*  I genuinely like him as a person. I think his show like made such a massive difference in the [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6220.88s)]
*  media landscape in an American history. I'm not taking Iowaska. Do you know what I mean? It's like, [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6226.240000000001s)]
*  nothing. I love Rogan. I'm not taking Iowaska. It's like, it just doesn't work that way. And so I do [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6231.360000000001s)]
*  wonder, I really don't know the answer, but like, is it Bobby Kennedy, you know, if he were to drop [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6235.52s)]
*  out and endorse Trump at this point, don't people kind of already know they had the option to support [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6239.2s)]
*  Donald Trump? And if they're still not supporting Donald Trump, there's probably a meaningful reason [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6243.599999999999s)]
*  why. And one of the things that, you know, kind of is, I think probably the reason why none of them [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6248.88s)]
*  will agree to have Bobby in any of these debates is because if they were to, then the topic of [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6255.92s)]
*  Trump's handling of COVID would have to come up. And Donald Trump is kind of lucky in a situation. [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6265.28s)]
*  Like it's, there's always this dynamic in some issues between Democrats and Republicans. So like, [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6271.28s)]
*  for example, when Barack Obama was president, all of the Republicans at that point, their criticism [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6276.96s)]
*  of him was that he was too soft on foreign policy. He won't even say radical Islamic jihad and, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6284.0s)]
*  you know, dumb Marco Rubio, you know, points like this. And so then he totally gets off the hook [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6291.12s)]
*  for his very aggressive foreign policy and the war in Libya and Syria and Yemen and all these [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6296.5599999999995s)]
*  wars that he started, by the way, all on the side of Al Qaeda. And no one ever gave him any pushback [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6302.88s)]
*  from that. Like no one ever, he never got held accountable or had to answer for any of that [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6308.64s)]
*  because the Republican talking point was he's weak on defense and we're tough on defense. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6313.599999999999s)]
*  And likewise with COVID, because the Democrats whole narrative the whole time was that he's not [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6319.44s)]
*  reacting enough. No one ever really gives Trump a hard time. I guess DeSantis tried to a little bit [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6327.759999999999s)]
*  when he ran against him, but it just fell flat. It's inch. I mean, if you just pull this, not to [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6334.4s)]
*  disrupt the flow here, but if you pull the thread a little bit on why were we aligned with Al Qaeda? [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6338.96s)]
*  Oh yeah. Yeah. Because they're not Shiites. That's why, because they're not backed by Iran. [[01:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6343.5199999999995s)]
*  And I've got to say, I'm hardly an expert on Islam, to put it mildly. I'm a Protestant Christian. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6348.16s)]
*  However, spending a lot of time around the world, you know, the Shiites are pretty sophisticated [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6354.48s)]
*  actually. And I do think that our portrait of what your average Shiite is like is totally wrong, [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6359.36s)]
*  completely wrong. There are a lot of very cosmopolitan Persians, like very cosmopolitan, [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6364.16s)]
*  very pro-Western, very smart, very interesting, not savages at all. I mean, I'm not, you know, [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6369.599999999999s)]
*  endorsing the foreign policy aims of Iran at all, or their system or anything, and I'm not [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6375.44s)]
*  endorsing Islam either branch, but the idea that the Shiites are like animals, that's, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6378.96s)]
*  that's bullshit. Well, also, that's just ignorant. I mean, look, there's lots of problems even in the [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6385.2s)]
*  Shiite world. I mean, there's, you know, but there's, but they're also not our enemies. Well, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6390.0s)]
*  exactly. Like they haven't, they haven't attacked us and they haven't attacked Europe. I mean, [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6396.24s)]
*  even the Houthis, I was taught as a child to hate the Houthis. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6402.0s)]
*  Of course, I never heard of the Houthis, tell about 20 minutes ago and they became our historic [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6408.16s)]
*  enemy. It's, you know, I think essentially what happened, right? Cause you think it's like really [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6412.4800000000005s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and ISIS are the two terrorist groups that have actually hit the United States of America [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6417.76s)]
*  and Europe. And you know what I mean? Like committed acts of terror against them. Both were [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6425.04s)]
*  armed and funded by the West at different points. And that's pretty appalling when you think about [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6430.400000000001s)]
*  it. But really, I mean, what happened is, and I don't know exactly how much of this was the [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6436.8s)]
*  propaganda or how much of it was genuinely believed by, by people who were pushing it. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6442.16s)]
*  But the certainly the stated propaganda, which was stated when Benjamin Netanyahu testified in [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6449.12s)]
*  2002 in front of Congress as a regional expert and explained how if you overthrow Saddam Hussein, [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6456.16s)]
*  democracy will sweep the region. This will put pressure on Iran and then they will have less [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6462.32s)]
*  influence on the region. And a lot of these neoconservatives seemed to actually believe this. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6467.84s)]
*  Now, I don't know if they did. It seems to me like some of them actually did. It's the dumbest thing [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6473.5199999999995s)]
*  in the freaking world to think you would have believed there. You had in Iraq where you have a [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6478.5599999999995s)]
*  Shiite majority that is held down by a Sunni minority that if you overthrow that government [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6485.04s)]
*  and install democracy, which means the Shiites, right? Like, because they're 60% of the country, [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6493.44s)]
*  so they win. That this will hurt Iran was insane. And anyway, so what ended up happening after the [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6498.88s)]
*  Iraq war, after we toppled Saddam Hussein, was that Iran got drastically more influence in the [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6506.4s)]
*  region. Now, it's possible that people like Dick Cheney and Benjamin Netanyahu and them kind of knew [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6511.92s)]
*  that was going to happen. And then they were like, well, then we'll just topple Iran next. So it'll [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6517.4400000000005s)]
*  all be fine. I don't know exactly. But there's no question. And there was a piece, I believe it was [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6520.8s)]
*  in The New Yorker called the redirect in either 2006 or 2007, where basically what was decided [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6524.96s)]
*  was that now that Iraq backfired so much, and Iran has so much more power in the region, [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6534.8s)]
*  that now we got to go take the Shiites down a peg. And this is really what was behind [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6543.52s)]
*  the attempt to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. And by the way, this not overthrowing our democracy, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6549.52s)]
*  and not putting bounties on US soldiers head in Afghanistan or whatever the other lies that they [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6558.64s)]
*  made up about Vladimir Putin. The real crime that Vladimir Putin committed was he denied the US a [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6564.160000000001s)]
*  regime change in Syria. And you could look at the way Vladimir Putin was talked about before [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6570.96s)]
*  Syria verse after Syria. It is so stark. George W. Bush said he looked into Vladimir Putin's eyes, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6577.4400000000005s)]
*  and he was a good Christian and Hillary Clinton had her reset button. It wasn't until he denied [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6585.12s)]
*  the American war machine a regime change that he became Adolf Hitler. He's hell bent on [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6590.8s)]
*  reconstituting the Soviet Union and all this other crap. That's really what it all started. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6598.16s)]
*  He saved Assad. Apparently he was close to Faisal al-Assad, [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6603.2s)]
*  Charles al-Assad's father. And Assad called him and said, I need your help. And he dispatched [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6607.5199999999995s)]
*  troops immediately. Which by the way, whatever you think the geopolitical balance or whoever side [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6612.64s)]
*  you're on, that is kind of the key to long lasting alliances is defending your allies with troops [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6618.400000000001s)]
*  when they ask you to. And the Biden administration has not done that to like legit allies, whatever. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6629.04s)]
*  And he was motivated to do it, I think, because he didn't want to see ISIS take over Damascus, [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6637.4400000000005s)]
*  which was a real threat at that point. And they were driving around in Toyota trucks. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6641.68s)]
*  And murdering all the Christians. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6646.08s)]
*  Yeah. And in the most barbaric, brutal way. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6647.360000000001s)]
*  Crucifying the Christians, but you're not allowed to notice that or something. And Tulsi Gabbard is [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6651.360000000001s)]
*  anti-American for caring what happens to the Christians of Syria. I think we're fast approaching [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6655.84s)]
*  a period where the people who've lied to us on all these different subjects should just be quiet. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6661.4400000000005s)]
*  Like be quiet. Like why? Is there somebody's demand that like, I'm sorry, David Fromer, [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6666.16s)]
*  whomever, like your opinion is just not even morning Joe. Like nobody can, like why are we allowing- [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6671.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you've got everything wrong, you know? [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6677.76s)]
*  Truly. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6680.64s)]
*  But I think it was, I think I heard you use the analogy or metaphor, but it's like the old like, [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6681.280000000001s)]
*  once they see your face, they have to kill you. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6689.04s)]
*  That's right. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6690.96s)]
*  Or once you see their face, they have to kill you. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6691.280000000001s)]
*  Once the kidnapper drops his mask. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6692.8s)]
*  And there is this feeling, and I do think this is also part of what freaks them all out about [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6695.76s)]
*  Donald Trump, is that, okay, so first of all, like we were saying before, he's leading a movement of [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6700.72s)]
*  really every tough man in America pretty much loves Donald Trump. Maybe not every, but you know, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6707.12s)]
*  the overwhelming majority of tough men in America love Donald Trump. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6713.04s)]
*  The non-Tim Walls ones. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6715.92s)]
*  Yes, that's right. Including the well-armed ones, including many people in law enforcement [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6717.04s)]
*  and the military. And so he's got that. Then he's running a campaign that is very specifically [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6723.44s)]
*  pointing a finger at DC and saying, these guys screwed you over. And he's also like a wild man, [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6731.92s)]
*  like he can't control what he says. It's the most charming and frustrating part of Donald Trump, [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6740.48s)]
*  you know what I mean? Even if he wanted to, he couldn't control himself. You know what I mean? [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6746.0s)]
*  He's going to say it. It's going to come out of his mouth. And then he's saying things [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6750.0s)]
*  on the campaign trail in 2016. And he says it in this kind of sloppy Trumpian way, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6754.4800000000005s)]
*  but he would be like, Obama created ISIS. Obama did that. Which is like not exactly true, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6760.64s)]
*  but there's a lot of truth to it. It's like, well, no, he didn't, but he did knowingly fund [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6768.32s)]
*  and arm them. And that is treason, literal treason. That is exactly what treason is. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6774.72s)]
*  Especially if he wasn't doing it on behalf of the United States. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6781.76s)]
*  Well, right. Well, exactly. And so now if you imagine, okay, now this wasn't just Obama who [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6784.64s)]
*  did this. I mean, this was Brennan in Operation Timber Sycamore, right? This was the plan. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6791.52s)]
*  John Kerry's even on tape talking about how they knew they saw ISIS was getting the weapons and [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6798.16s)]
*  stuff. But they were like, Hey, like, you know, we'll just keep promoting this myth of the moderate [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6802.64s)]
*  rebels. So ridiculous. And then that'll put pressure on Assad to step down. So this is how [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6806.400000000001s)]
*  we're going to get our regime change war. And then ISIS went and invaded Iraq. They weren't supposed [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6810.72s)]
*  to do that. And then Obama had to go back into Iraq to kick them out. But the point is that this [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6815.04s)]
*  is actual treason. You know, like arming, giving material aid and comfort to the enemy, like Al Qaeda [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6820.4800000000005s)]
*  in Iraq and in Syria is getting weapons from America. That is treason. And now you got this guy [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6828.639999999999s)]
*  who's essentially calling you out for treason, who might be the president of the United States [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6837.36s)]
*  of America. Like the punishment for treason is the death penalty. And I do think like, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6841.44s)]
*  I think Donald Trump himself didn't even realize what enemies you're making when you say that and [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6847.2s)]
*  how much power they have. Like you, you know, like who's the last president who like fired the head [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6854.08s)]
*  of the CIA and made a big thing about how he was going to smash it into a million pieces? [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6860.96s)]
*  What happened to him? [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6865.28s)]
*  He took a limo ride through Dallas, right? So it's like Donald Trump, I think was totally naive [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6866.24s)]
*  about like, you know, he knew there was a swamp that needed draining, but I don't think he knew [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6873.12s)]
*  what was in that swamp. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6878.8s)]
*  He wasn't watching Schumer on Rachel Maddow's show. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6879.76s)]
*  Right, right. And I do think, you know, being in the world of business gave him a lot of correct [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6881.92s)]
*  instincts. And, but it's like, no, man, there's just nothing like this. Government isn't the [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6887.84s)]
*  business world. Government is the criminal organization world, which, you know, maybe he [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6893.76s)]
*  probably had a little bit of experience in a real estate development. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6899.84s)]
*  The painters union or whatever. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6903.28s)]
*  Yeah, running casinos and stuff like that. I'm sure he's kind of been around, but not like this, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6904.08s)]
*  man. That's nothing compared to you're talking about the CIA. That is a whole different piece. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6909.52s)]
*  These are not paving contracts. This is control of the world. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6914.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And so there was just all of this, you know, got this tremendous reaction and he's still [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6918.0s)]
*  dealing with that. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6924.56s)]
*  I'm a little bit confused that for two years, we were told that the vanguard of the fight for [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6925.76s)]
*  democracy was unfolding in Eastern Ukraine was really, it mattered much more than anything in [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6931.84s)]
*  our stupid, meaningless lives here in the United States. And that's why all good people wore the [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6936.96s)]
*  blue and yellow lapel pin and put the little flags in front of their houses and Napa and all that. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6941.36s)]
*  And then one day we just stopped hearing anything about Ukraine. What was that? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6946.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, the, it was all built off lies and it's been a disaster like all of these [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6950.72s)]
*  wars and it's not gone at all the way it was supposed to. I mean, remember there was a period [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6957.52s)]
*  where Joe Biden at the very beginning of the war was just with sanctions. We're going to defeat [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6962.24s)]
*  Russia. We're going to destroy the RuPaul and, you know, but make everyone in Russia poor and [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6967.76s)]
*  that'll be so great. And we wouldn't even have to send in weapons. And then of course we had to, [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6971.84s)]
*  and of course just all the lies Ukraine is winning, ghost of Kiev, all these crazy, just [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6975.44s)]
*  obvious lies. And so ultimately you're at a point where, yeah, you don't really want to talk about [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6980.08s)]
*  that because there's nothing you can point to and brag about, but isn't it crazy? You know, [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6987.2s)]
*  I did a, a debate on, on this topic on, on breaking points. That's was a great show. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=6992.5599999999995s)]
*  And you've, you've been on with Crystal and Sagar. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7002.8s)]
*  Yeah. I know Sagar well. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7006.4s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, that's right. He used to work for you, right? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7008.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7010.0s)]
*  Yeah. He's great. I love that guy. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7010.16s)]
*  Yeah, I do too. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7011.92s)]
*  But so I was on, I did a debate on that show and I was kind of like talking about how it was crazy [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7013.04s)]
*  for all these people who have like the Ukrainian flags and we care so much about Ukraine and all [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7018.4800000000005s)]
*  of this stuff. It's like, do you recognize that we, we hold all the chips, like the United States of [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7022.4s)]
*  America holds all of the chips. We could get this war to stop in almost any way we wanted to, if we [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7029.2s)]
*  want to just play our ultimate Trump card, which is that we'll leave NATO. I mean, there's no [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7035.68s)]
*  reason for us to be in NATO anyway. It totally makes no sense. It's, I know, you know, I know [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7042.8s)]
*  you've talked about a bunch. Like it's like, this was started after world war two because Europe had [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7047.92s)]
*  been totally destroyed. America was like the only advanced country that was like left standing and [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7053.68s)]
*  hadn't had their homeland wrecked by the thing. And then there's this Soviet union. And so these [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7059.68s)]
*  guys can't defend themselves. We have to kind of work on this deal that we, we're not going to let [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7066.08s)]
*  you invade Western Europe or we'll come to their defense. And now it's like Europe is rich. America's [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7070.24s)]
*  $35 trillion in debt. And oh yeah, the Soviet union doesn't exist. What's the point of this thing [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7076.48s)]
*  being here? And Vladimir Putin would do almost anything to get that to happen, to get America, [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7081.84s)]
*  to leave NATO. It would be nothing but good for us. We just wouldn't be subsidizing other [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7089.76s)]
*  rich countries defense. He could take it as a huge victory. You know what I mean? You could get almost [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7094.08s)]
*  anything you want. And if you guys care about Ukrainians and Ukrainians dying so much, why not? [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7099.76s)]
*  Why not just make this deal? We could do it right now. I mean, we're not getting Crimea back to [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7104.08s)]
*  Ukraine. That's not going to happen, but who cares? You know what I mean? You could get almost any, [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7108.8s)]
*  you could get the end to the war immediately. If you were to do this, you know how many jobs [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7112.8s)]
*  now occupied by people with no skills whatsoever, totally pointless people, [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7117.84s)]
*  pure parasites on our economy and culture would be lost. Yeah. If we get rid of NATO. Yeah. Well, [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7122.320000000001s)]
*  that's the problem. That's the issue. It's why they get rid of the energy department, [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7127.92s)]
*  the education department. I mean, they've served no purpose other than self-perpetuation. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7132.32s)]
*  And they've made all of those areas much worse than they were. It's like unbelievable. I mean, [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7136.96s)]
*  like the state of education in America, what did it get a lot better since, was it Jimmy Carter [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7143.2s)]
*  that created the Department of Education? And of course, like, I mean, it's, you know, [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7147.76s)]
*  this model doesn't work. It should have been the one lesson of the 20th century. That model [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7153.2s)]
*  doesn't work. Centralized control does not work. This is why all of those countries failed and [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7158.8s)]
*  continue to fail everywhere it's tried. And now we're doing it and we're failing. Because it [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7165.12s)]
*  benefits the few. So let me circle back to the beginning of the conversation here at the end. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7169.68s)]
*  You haven't been here in two and a half months, maybe. A lot has changed all of your [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7174.24s)]
*  kind of core suspicions have been confirmed, I think, by the assassination attempt and the [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7182.32s)]
*  subsequent coup. Where does that leave you? Like, we've just spent a couple hours talking about how [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7188.96s)]
*  bad things are and about all the signs that they're, ominous signs that they're about to get much [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7194.5599999999995s)]
*  worse. Does that make you feel afraid, hopeful, excited, a combination? Yeah, probably a combination, [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7199.759999999999s)]
*  I would say, you know, which by the way, we didn't even really get into the coup, but it is pretty [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7207.68s)]
*  crazy how much of a blatant coup we just watched. I've seen people like Democrats on social media [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7211.84s)]
*  and stuff, and they'll call like people like us out and they'll be like, well, first you said the [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7219.52s)]
*  guy was too senile to run and now you're saying it was a coup when they removed him. You're like, [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7224.320000000001s)]
*  yeah, both are true. I don't know what to tell you. The guy is clearly senile. And also he is [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7228.160000000001s)]
*  still the president of the United States of America. And there's a process here. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7232.8s)]
*  They'll say, and it's just, the one thing I can't get over is not that people disagree with me. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7236.32s)]
*  I assume people are always going to disagree with me. I'm often wrong. So it's like, it's okay to [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7242.639999999999s)]
*  disagree with me. What I can never metabolize, accept, deal with is people's willingness to just [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7246.5599999999995s)]
*  say anything. You just like move the goalpost. Because it's expedient. The capacity for lying [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7252.88s)]
*  among certain people just blows my mind. You tell Joe Scarborough, you got to say this, because [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7258.16s)]
*  there's some material advantage to you. He will say it no matter what it is. And all that way. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7264.24s)]
*  It's like, how would you describe threatening a man until he agrees not to run for president again, [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7269.5199999999995s)]
*  and then installing somebody without a vote? Like that's a coup. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7277.12s)]
*  And by the way, it's totally unclear. And I would say, we don't know for sure, but I would say like [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7280.5599999999995s)]
*  the high likelihood is that he didn't ever agree to it until after the letter was out. I mean, look, [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7287.04s)]
*  it is so you cannot overstate how bizarre it is that a few weeks before the democratic convention, [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7295.2s)]
*  when Joe Biden had already gone through a couple weeks of all these calls for him to step down, [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7304.32s)]
*  at every single turn said, no, I've made up my mind. I am not stepping down. It's me versus Trump. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7310.8s)]
*  So get used to it. I beat him last time and I'll beat him again this time. That morning, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7318.24s)]
*  the morning that the letter comes out was Sunday. His surrogates are going on the Sunday talk shows [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7323.92s)]
*  and saying enough with like an hour before the letter. They go enough of this. He's made up his [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7331.28s)]
*  mind. He's running even after Pelosi and Schumer meet with him, even after the 90 million or [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7336.56s)]
*  whatever is held back from his kid. He's like, no, I'm going to. And then you're telling me [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7342.320000000001s)]
*  the sitting president of the United States of America, a few weeks before the convention [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7346.4800000000005s)]
*  is announcing that he won't be seeking reelection. And this is not done in an address to the nation. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7351.360000000001s)]
*  This is done on personal stationary and just tweeted out. And then in a separate tweet, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7357.68s)]
*  he endorses Kamala Harris. And it's not for days later that we hear from the president. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7364.0s)]
*  That is crazy. I mean, I know so many crazy things are going on that it's almost easy to not [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7370.64s)]
*  appreciate how crazy that one is. And you could say, oh, he had COVID or whatever. They just get [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7375.6s)]
*  up, I don't know, put on one of those masks that you guys pretended worked for so many years and [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7383.04s)]
*  he can even be an edited video. It doesn't have to be live. I know he stumbles a lot or whatever. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7388.0s)]
*  It could be two minutes, but how do you not address the American people about that? [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7392.64s)]
*  And it just, it really seems like, and of course, I heard, she had that reporting on the call with [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7397.280000000001s)]
*  Obama where they threatened, they had Kamala Harris on board. We're going to invoke the 25th [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7402.64s)]
*  amendment. But my suspicion is that that phone call happened, you know, like the Schumer and [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7406.400000000001s)]
*  Pelosi strong arming didn't work. Obama comes in, we're going to remove you from office and this [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7412.96s)]
*  will be your legacy. And then the letter is tweeted out already and it's presented as a [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7418.24s)]
*  fait accompli to him. It's all over. And then eventually he goes, I have to make sure. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7423.84s)]
*  What does it say? I mean, if the sitting president of the United States, purportedly the most [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7427.679999999999s)]
*  powerful man in the world, doesn't have enough power to run again for the job he currently holds, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7431.44s)]
*  he cannot, he's not allowed to. It's not, none of it's real. The presidency is not real. The [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7438.08s)]
*  president doesn't hold the power. I mean, they just showed us that. So it's then how do you, [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7444.56s)]
*  people are not thinking this through. How do our system is voluntary? All systems are. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7450.160000000001s)]
*  How do they expect us to accept the election results, abide by those results, pay our taxes? [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7455.04s)]
*  How do they expect us to obey when the system has been revealed as illegitimate? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7461.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Well, it's the only way would be some type of escalation of force. You know, I mean, [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7465.200000000001s)]
*  that's the only way to do it. I will say though that, you know, much like when the Soviet Union [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7469.12s)]
*  collapsed and was largely peaceful, you know, and was kind of like a really amazing thing. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7476.32s)]
*  It was very peaceful. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7481.76s)]
*  And now what happened in the years following it was not good and that didn't need to happen. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7482.48s)]
*  No, but they pulled their nuclear weapons out of all their satellite states. They dissolved [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7487.599999999999s)]
*  the Warsaw pact. I mean, that happened by the way, 33 years ago this week. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7491.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7496.32s)]
*  I was on my honeymoon. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7496.4s)]
*  And, and you know, there, there were people at the top who wanted to not let it happen, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7497.44s)]
*  but like, no, escalate the force and don't let this happen. Put down these revolts like they [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7505.12s)]
*  had done previously. And ultimately they just kind of lost. And like enough people were just like, [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7509.36s)]
*  no, just let them go. You know, so that's, you kind of hope that something like that can happen in [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7514.639999999999s)]
*  the United States of America. And that doesn't mean like a national divorce type thing, which [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7520.96s)]
*  is something that has become kind of a popular thing that some people advocate for. But it does [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7525.28s)]
*  mean some type of like decentralization of power and Washington just having much less power than [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7532.48s)]
*  it currently does have. I think that it is that, and I said this to you last time, it's the great [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7541.12s)]
*  case for optimism is that all of this government tyranny relies on propaganda and the propaganda [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7547.5199999999995s)]
*  is being broken at an unbelievable rate. Things that would have seemed unimaginable [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7555.12s)]
*  very recently in my adult lifetime, like not, you know, generations ago, but just years ago. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7563.2s)]
*  And we're seeing that now and people are waking up in a very profound way. I mean, it really is, [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7569.92s)]
*  it is all fake and more and more people are aware of that. Like it's you, if you zoom out and go [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7576.72s)]
*  like from my mother's, you know, when my mother was my age to me being this age, it is unbelievable [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7583.68s)]
*  how much more people understand that this is all fake. You're right. Propaganda is the key. I mean, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7591.4400000000005s)]
*  Joseph Goebbels, not to make everything a Nazi reference, but it was five, four crippled, [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7596.320000000001s)]
*  never fired a gun in his life except into his own head in the end, never commanded an army. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7601.12s)]
*  You know, he was the political chief of Berlin, but he was the propaganda chief and therefore he [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7607.12s)]
*  was the pivotal person in the Nazi government. He was, because he was in charge of people's brains. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7612.08s)]
*  And so that you cannot, and I'm not comparing anyone to the Nazis. I hate Nazi references in [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7616.96s)]
*  general, but that's just true. Propaganda is kind of everything actually. Yeah. And that it's the [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7623.44s)]
*  most powerful thing to control. It's more powerful than controlling the laws or the money or the [[02:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7630.5599999999995s)]
*  military. Absolutely right. You control what people think, you know, you control narratives. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7636.0s)]
*  And it's amazing. I mean, look, it's still very effective. It's not nearly as effective as it once [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7640.96s)]
*  was. But it is still there. And you see it like when people get taken over by the propaganda, [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7645.6s)]
*  it's such a bizarre thing. I mean, you're like, it's like talking to someone and there's no soul [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7651.36s)]
*  there when they just repeat back the propaganda to you or something. January 6th was an insurrection. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7656.4800000000005s)]
*  You're like, I'm not having a conversation with you. I'm having a conversation with like what Don [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7661.36s)]
*  Lemon convinced you you're supposed to believe. You know people who fallen for that? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7666.16s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't know in like my close circle or anything like that. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7671.68s)]
*  But what do you think, I know I'm so far afield again, but I'm just, I'm, I'm, [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7676.72s)]
*  I don't know the answer to this. What distinguishes someone who falls for the crudest kind of [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7680.16s)]
*  propaganda, January 6th was an insurrection, Don Lemon smart, whatever the lie is from you. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7685.36s)]
*  So many people are smart. I mean, it's not just an IQ difference. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7692.24s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. It's not an IQ difference. There's people far smarter than me who fall for it. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7694.72s)]
*  Oh, me too. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7698.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. No question about that. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7698.88s)]
*  So what is it? [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7700.16s)]
*  I don't completely know. I think there's something about, there's, it's like human beings are, [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7700.96s)]
*  we're pack animals, you know, and that's like very at the core of us. You stay within the pack [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7709.2s)]
*  because like out here is death. You know, if I'm like, so like you stay in here. Right. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7715.76s)]
*  And there's something, there's a personality type that certain people have. It's not, again, [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7720.24s)]
*  it is not about being left or right. It's not at all, but there's something where people have, [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7725.76s)]
*  you know, like there's, there's people who, like I disagree with on a lot of issues, but like Alex [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7730.8s)]
*  Berenson is very willing to go outside the pack. He's like, okay, oh, you want to like have all [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7736.639999999999s)]
*  these arrows come at me. Okay. Fine. You know, Glenn Greenwald is very willing to do. I think [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7741.92s)]
*  you're very willing to do that. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7745.92s)]
*  Berenson's such a great example because I, I really like Berenson. I text them all the time, [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7747.52s)]
*  but I just absolutely disagree with him on a lot of issues, but I will never stop. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7752.4800000000005s)]
*  He was so great. I mean, his sub stack was like a cathartic to read during COVID. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7756.8s)]
*  And it was, he is smart. Berenson's smart. He's a good reporter. I think he's a really nice guy, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7761.76s)]
*  but, but really his indispensable quality was bravery. Yeah, that's right. That's what made [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7766.88s)]
*  him different. That's it. Cause look, I mean, like he was in. Yeah. You were in and you're in [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7770.72s)]
*  the New York times. You're in all this and you're going to risk all of that just to be right about [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7775.68s)]
*  something. You know, I mean, like it doesn't even make sense when I say it out loud. You're like, [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7780.400000000001s)]
*  why would you do that? It's a terrible calculation. Oh, it's totally true. But there are some people [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7784.160000000001s)]
*  who just do kind of get, so that's, you know, but when you, so many of the people who, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7788.080000000001s)]
*  and this is something I don't say this like attacking right-wing America. I just, it's [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7795.04s)]
*  something like to be humble about, but like in 2002, in the run up to the war in Iraq, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7798.64s)]
*  so many of these people who are like great now about seeing through all of this just knew it [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7805.6s)]
*  as a certainty that like, obviously Saddam Hussein has nuclear weapons and he clearly was involved [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7810.400000000001s)]
*  in nine 11 and like, he's going to hand these nukes that he doesn't have off to the terrorists. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7815.68s)]
*  He's not friends with, and they're going to nuke as if, unless you go support overthrowing him. [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7819.84s)]
*  They just knew that as a matter of, and essentially what are you some type of wimp, [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7824.5599999999995s)]
*  if you don't agree with them on that and they didn't even kind of realize that they were, [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7828.32s)]
*  they were doing the exact same thing as some 20 year old who tells you about climate change. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7832.48s)]
*  It's totally right. You're just repeating lies that someone else put into your head. Like they, [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7835.679999999999s)]
*  you are a puppet right now. You know what I mean? And you don't even realize it. And so, but it was [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7841.44s)]
*  like, I don't know, that was the culture they were in. That was the world they were in. They [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7846.959999999999s)]
*  saw these towers get hit and what are you a pussy? No, you were going to go do something about that. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7851.28s)]
*  And so it's people play like people's sense of identity is very important to them. I remember, [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7856.08s)]
*  okay, one time I was, I have a younger brother who's much younger than me is 13 years younger [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7863.44s)]
*  than me from my mother's second marriage. And he's great, unbelievable kid. I love him to death. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7870.48s)]
*  And so he was, I think he was three years old. So I would, I was 16 and I was watching a Knicks game. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7876.56s)]
*  I'll never forget this three year old kid. And he comes over to me and he was like asking about it. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7884.160000000001s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, come watch the game with me. And so we're sitting on the couch. He's three. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7890.0s)]
*  We're watching a Knicks game. And he, he looked at me and he went, well, which one is me? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7893.6s)]
*  And I was like, what do you mean? Which one is you? I was like, oh, we're rooting for the team in the blue [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7900.8s)]
*  shirts. And then he kind of accepted that like, okay, that's, but I just remember always thinking [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7907.76s)]
*  there's like this, it's like so profound that that's what's in us. It's like, okay, you want me to like [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7912.16s)]
*  get into this like kind of projected abstraction. So who am I? What defines me? Like that's so [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7917.12s)]
*  important to people. It's like right at the core of everything is like, who am I like as a, as a [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7924.8s)]
*  person, like what's my identity? And I think that for like, look, you saw this with, with like broadly [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7930.400000000001s)]
*  speaking, like liberal America. Well, during COVID it's like their identity, their whole identity [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7937.84s)]
*  is that they're the scientific people. You know, you, you guys are the backwards rubes who believe [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7945.76s)]
*  in superstition and religion, but we believe in science and reason and this is what makes us better. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7950.96s)]
*  That's their identity. So once you tell them that it's like, well, the science says this, it was so [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7956.32s)]
*  easy to get them in. It's right. So easy to get them in on climate change. And then with like more [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7961.6s)]
*  conservative America, their whole identity is that like, they're the tough ones who defend the country, [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7965.52s)]
*  who aren't who aren't wusses who will, who will defend the constitution. And so as soon as you fed [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7972.0s)]
*  them a narrative that, that, you know, gave them that identity, it was so easy to fool them with all [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcMYwTVTS5I&t=7976.96s)]
