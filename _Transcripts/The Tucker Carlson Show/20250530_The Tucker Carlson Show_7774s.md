Video Description: CNN spends five years lying about Joe Biden’s dementia, gets caught, and then instead of apologizing, pretends to break the story that Biden has brain damage. This, says Glenn Greenwald, is why every honest person on earth hates corporate media.

# Glenn Greenwald: The Truth About Epstein, Jake Tapper's Humiliation, & Insane New Push to Nuke Gaza
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA)
*  It must be a little weird to get scooped by CNN on Joe Biden's dementia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=0.0s)]
*  Like you have no idea. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  None of us knew. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  None of us knew. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  You know, but no, now Jake Tapper has uncovered the truth. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Like it turns out Joe Biden was in cognitive decline. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=10.84s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=13.08s)]
*  What? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=14.08s)]
*  How did he find out? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=15.08s)]
*  Just hardcore shoe leather, investing in reporting his work and his sources, like calling all [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  the people in Washington, digging up like FOIA documents. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=19.72s)]
*  I just find the Epstein file so fascinating because the two biggest issues are, are there [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=24.32s)]
*  people to whom he trafficked minors, but nobody has been charged with being the recipient [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=28.56s)]
*  of that sex trafficking. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=33.82s)]
*  But the much more interesting question for me is, was he working with or for any foreign [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=35.58s)]
*  intelligence agencies? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=40.8s)]
*  Israel is the number one recipient of NSA technology and NSA intelligence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=42.64s)]
*  But at the same time, the documents that describe who are our greatest intelligence threats, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=46.84s)]
*  who are our greatest intelligence adversaries, who spies on us the most, who is capable of [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=52.76s)]
*  spying out the most, number one on the list is Israel as well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=57.14s)]
*  All right, Glenn, I think last time you were here, I ambushed you just by rolling the cameras. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=81.06s)]
*  Not doing that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=85.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  It was funny because every show you ever go on, it always begins in some sort of way to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  indicate that you're actually starting like, Glenn Greenwald, welcome to the program. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=91.28s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker, for having me. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=94.1s)]
*  But the last time I was on, we were just sitting here chatting and it turned out 10 minutes [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=95.1s)]
*  in, I was like, oh, we're rolling? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=98.58s)]
*  Yeah, we've been rolling since we started. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=99.86s)]
*  Yeah, but you are one of those people, and this is the highest compliment I can give, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=101.3s)]
*  who's exactly the same off camera, exactly the same as you are on camera. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=104.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=108.89999999999999s)]
*  Exactly the same. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=109.89999999999999s)]
*  There's no difference at all. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=110.89999999999999s)]
*  I thought our conversation was just the conversation that we always have. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  And it turned out it was just the show, which made no difference. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=114.5s)]
*  We went, your staff, Curtis, let me see the first time minute. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=116.98s)]
*  I was like, yeah, that's what I think. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=120.1s)]
*  That's how I speak and that's all fine. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=121.98s)]
*  Yeah, there is, if you like Glenn Greenwald, you'll like him at dinner. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=124.1s)]
*  Trust me, that's what I can say about you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=127.46000000000001s)]
*  So you are, I think, the Dean of alternative media. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=129.7s)]
*  You've been doing this longer than anybody that I know personally. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=132.9s)]
*  So it must be a little weird to get scooped by CNN on Joe Biden's dementia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=137.3s)]
*  Like, you have no idea. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=141.46s)]
*  None of us knew. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=142.46s)]
*  I mean, there was that debate and we were all shocked, but we were like, but we were [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=143.5s)]
*  told he had a cold. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=148.46s)]
*  So I was like, okay, he's on some cold medication. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=149.46s)]
*  Like who hasn't been there before? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=151.22s)]
*  He makes you a little drug, like a little droggy, a little groggy, a little just like [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=152.22s)]
*  dragged. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=156.62s)]
*  But no, now Jake Tapper has uncovered the truth. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=157.78s)]
*  Like it turns out Joe Biden was in cognitive decline. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=160.9s)]
*  Did you know that? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=163.3s)]
*  How did he find out? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=164.3s)]
*  Just hardcore shoe leather, investigative reporting. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  Just working his sources. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=167.94s)]
*  Just working his sources, like calling all the people in Washington, digging up like [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=168.94s)]
*  FOIA documents. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=172.78s)]
*  No, it really, you know, it's one of those things where you kind of can't believe what [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=176.78s)]
*  you're witnessing because Jake Tapper is pretending to have uncovered a scandal that he himself [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  led the way in the media or one of the leaders in the media in covering up to the point where [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  if somebody would go on his show and say, Joe Biden is obviously in cognitive decline. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=194.5s)]
*  He can't get a sentence out. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=199.34s)]
*  He would say, how dare you bully kids who stutter? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=201.54000000000002s)]
*  Are you at all ashamed of what you're doing? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=205.34s)]
*  That's what he told Laura Trump. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=207.14000000000001s)]
*  But she was like, yeah, I just, I feel bad for Joe Biden. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=208.14000000000001s)]
*  I wish he could get a sentence out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=210.38000000000002s)]
*  And he's like, do you ever think about what you're doing to kids who stutter and the kind [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=211.62s)]
*  of world you're creating for them? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=215.78s)]
*  And she's like, what? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  Like everyone else, I never even knew Joe Biden had a stutter. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  I've been watching him for decades. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=221.14000000000001s)]
*  I never saw him stutter before. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=222.14000000000001s)]
*  The whole stuttering thing was just... [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=224.58s)]
*  Did he actually say that? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=226.22000000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  Laura Trump, that she was like at an event and she was a very like benign remark. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=229.06s)]
*  She was just saying, yeah, you watched Joe Biden. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=234.42s)]
*  Because we talked about this before when I was on your show. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=236.62s)]
*  It wasn't even when he was president, it was in the run up to the 2020 campaign and we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=240.26s)]
*  were talking about this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=244.1s)]
*  And we always talked about everybody I know did, no one takes joy in it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=245.18s)]
*  We've all had that experience of watching an older person in our family go through cognitive [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=249.14s)]
*  decline. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=253.42s)]
*  It's actually quite sad. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=254.42s)]
*  The way she was saying it was like, yeah, honestly as a human being, I watched Joe Biden [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=256.18s)]
*  and he's in the middle of a sentence that he can't finish. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=260.74s)]
*  I'm like, come on, Joe, get that out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=262.46s)]
*  And then when she went on the Jake Tapper show, he played that tape and he said, do [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  you understand the world of bullying that you're creating for kids who stutter? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=269.46s)]
*  And she was like, what? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=273.53999999999996s)]
*  How can you expect stuttering kids? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=275.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=279.46s)]
*  And she's like, I didn't even know he had a stutter. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=280.46s)]
*  He said, and we all know he has a stutter and I know that you were mocking his stutter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=281.78s)]
*  And so this was not just a person who didn't speak about Joe Biden's cognitive decline, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=286.66s)]
*  who's now uncovering this shocking truth that 85% of the public has known for years according [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=292.18s)]
*  to polls. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=297.46s)]
*  He would go on, I heard him this week saying, one of the very few people, because he was [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=298.46s)]
*  asked why didn't people in the Democratic Party speak up and say this since they all [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=303.38s)]
*  knew it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=307.78s)]
*  And he said, well, Dean Phillips tried and he got mauled and maligned and his character [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=308.78s)]
*  was attacked by the Democratic Party. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=314.42s)]
*  I was like, by the Democratic Party? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=315.98s)]
*  Go watch what happened when Dean Phillips went on Jake Tapper's show and said that one [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=318.06s)]
*  of the reasons he was running for president, he was concerned about Joe Biden's age and [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=322.3s)]
*  his infirmities and how he couldn't win and couldn't govern. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=325.78000000000003s)]
*  And Jake Tapper said to him, do you know that your Democratic colleagues despise you and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=329.42s)]
*  they've been telling me the worst possible thing? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=334.82s)]
*  That's what he did to everybody who went on his show in order to say, hey, I think Joe [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=337.90000000000003s)]
*  Biden's in cognitive decline. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=343.02000000000004s)]
*  I mean, obviously he wanted Biden to win desperately and would not tolerate anyone going on the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=345.38s)]
*  show and saying that Biden was in cognitive decline. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=351.46s)]
*  And now he's making millions of dollars off a book. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=353.58s)]
*  But the only good thing is that his credibility is so in tatters from it that he had to hire [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=355.86s)]
*  a PR crisis firm, like the kind that Anthony Weiner had to hire, that like Puffy Combs [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=361.78s)]
*  hired. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=366.9s)]
*  Imagine being a journalist and being exposed as such a fraud that you have to hire a PR [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=367.9s)]
*  crisis team of the kind that like public figures hire when they're involved in some like big [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=373.26s)]
*  sex scandal or like bribery scandal. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=378.38s)]
*  That's who's managing Jake Tapper's behavior and his comportment. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=381.42s)]
*  They've tried to place like hit pieces on me and succeed in like shitty places like [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=385.3s)]
*  the Daily Beast. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=389.3s)]
*  But everything he says now is scripted, you know, like every interview he does now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=390.82s)]
*  At first it was like, what are you talking about? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=394.53999999999996s)]
*  This is outrageous. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=396.3s)]
*  And now every time he's in an interview, he says, I look back on my coverage with humility. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=397.42s)]
*  You know that phrase they feed you to make it seem like you're accepting accountability [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=402.78s)]
*  even though you're really not? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=406.02s)]
*  False humility is called, yes. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=407.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=408.02s)]
*  What's interesting though is that it wasn't just, you know, I disagree with you, Biden [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=409.02s)]
*  seems fine to me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=415.17999999999995s)]
*  What's interesting is that he used the kind of most vulgar moral blackmail you can. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=417.17999999999995s)]
*  Like you're attacking children who stutter. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=422.82s)]
*  You're attacking disabled kids when you criticize the president of the United States. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=424.46s)]
*  Like that is so low. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  It's hard to believe that happened. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=430.26s)]
*  I haven't seen the clip. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=431.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=432.74s)]
*  I mean, he claims he called Laura Trump to apologize. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=433.74s)]
*  Maybe he should do that on his show since that's where he told his audience she was [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=436.14s)]
*  attacking kids who stutter. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=440.53999999999996s)]
*  Like that's a pretty, that's like one of the worst things pretty much that you could do [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=442.02s)]
*  is like bully kids with disabilities, right? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=445.26s)]
*  Like if my kids ever did that, I would punish them for three months. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=448.34s)]
*  You know, so like accusing her of having done that, like probably doesn't warrant a private [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=451.42s)]
*  apology or maybe it does too. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=455.86s)]
*  But also, you know, you go on air and you were like, hey, I did something really despicable. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  You know what's so amazing too is they're trying to rewrite history. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=461.74s)]
*  Obviously, one of the ways they're trying to rewrite history is to say we were the victims [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=463.94s)]
*  of the fraud. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=468.1s)]
*  We in the media were the victims of the fraud and we're so angry at this inner team of Joe [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=469.1s)]
*  Biden's White House advisors who kept this from us, who hid this, even though the entire [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=472.58s)]
*  public knew forever. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=478.82s)]
*  But I know I've written about this so many times it drives me crazy how easily history [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=480.66s)]
*  is rewritten. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=484.94s)]
*  The first time I ever heard concerns about Joe Biden's cognitive decline was back in [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  2018 when the Democratic field was coalescing of, you know, people who were going to run [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=491.76s)]
*  against Donald Trump and they were really worried Joe Biden was going to get the nomination [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=498.44s)]
*  solely by virtue of name recognition because he was the vice president to Barack Obama [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=502.68s)]
*  for eight years, was viewed as loyal, has been around forever. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=507.14s)]
*  And they all knew there was no way he could sustain the rigors of an election because [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=510.36s)]
*  he was in cognitive decline. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  So it was like these Democratic operatives like Andrea Mitchell talked about it, Cory [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=515.96s)]
*  Booker and Julian Castro in that 2019 debate all made fun of Biden for not being able to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=519.6s)]
*  remember what he had said three seconds ago. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=525.04s)]
*  It was the Democrats who were raising it trying to alert everybody that you shouldn't vote [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=528.12s)]
*  for Joe Biden because he's not the same Joe Biden he was. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=532.92s)]
*  I'm not talking about 2023, I'm talking about 2018 and 2019. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=535.6s)]
*  The minute it was down to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the 2020 primary, that's when all [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=539.08s)]
*  of a sudden the media narrative shifted and it became the only people who are talking [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=546.5600000000001s)]
*  about Biden's supposed cognitive decline are Bernie bros and MAGA people and it's absolutely [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=551.9200000000001s)]
*  immoral and disgusting. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's when I wrote an article saying, what do you mean you were the ones who first [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=558.5200000000001s)]
*  raised it? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  I heard it from you, you know, those DC insiders. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  So it's not, the only reason why, you know, what saved Joe Biden from that was that COVID [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=566.88s)]
*  happened and he got to run the campaign from his basement where he only talked to like [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=572.64s)]
*  Nicole Wallace who spoke to him like some, you know, ailing grandpa. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=576.88s)]
*  You know that voice that you use for like your ailing grandpa like, Mr. President, Mr. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=580.84s)]
*  Biden, hello. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=585.36s)]
*  Oh, and then you do that fake laugh, they get even close to a joke because those were [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=586.36s)]
*  the kind of interviews he was doing and he was in that basement in Delaware. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=590.2s)]
*  That's the only reason why he could sustain that campaign. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=593.72s)]
*  But it was so widely known. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=596.88s)]
*  I mean, his sister, Valerie, told a good friend of mine that she didn't want him to run in [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=598.88s)]
*  2020 because he had dementia. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=603.8s)]
*  My former makeup artist, a makeup artist was there in the room when he was injected with [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=607.12s)]
*  amphetamines before an event more than once during that campaign. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=612.1999999999999s)]
*  And like I said all that on TV and everyone I knew in DC who knew Biden, I knew Biden, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=617.24s)]
*  said, yeah, no, he's got dementia. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=621.72s)]
*  Everybody knew, everybody knew. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=623.66s)]
*  It wasn't just like some right wing Twitter thing where people were being cruel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=626.58s)]
*  It was like the people who knew Biden knew that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=630.02s)]
*  So like, how could you not know? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=632.46s)]
*  I think the reason this media fraud of all the other media frauds that have been perpetrated [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=633.98s)]
*  is probably the most damaging. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=639.18s)]
*  In 2016, they pushed this whole deranged, demented conspiracy theory that Vladimir Putin [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=641.38s)]
*  had sex tapes on Donald Trump where he was being urinated on by a prostitute. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=648.3s)]
*  And of course, if we know Donald Trump, that's pretty much the last thing that all the people [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=652.22s)]
*  on the planet do whatever. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=656.22s)]
*  It's one thing he didn't commit, yeah, no, for sure. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=657.22s)]
*  But it was that sort of thing. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=659.1s)]
*  They always accuse people on independent media or whoever of being conspiracy theorists. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=661.14s)]
*  Think about that conspiracy. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=666.06s)]
*  Donald Trump was being blackmailed by the Russian government into sacrificing the interests [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=667.42s)]
*  of the United States to serve the interests of the Kremlin. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=671.62s)]
*  That really was the predominant media narrative from 2016 to 2018. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=674.54s)]
*  So that's what they did to try and stop Trump the first time. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=678.1s)]
*  In 2020, weeks before the election, the New York Post had very serious reporting about [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=680.82s)]
*  the Biden family unethically exploiting Joe Biden's influence in Ukraine and China to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=686.3000000000001s)]
*  profit not for themselves only, but also for Joe Biden. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=690.62s)]
*  And we were told by the media over and over the lie that this is Russian disinformation, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=693.7800000000001s)]
*  that this laptop should be, the contents of it should be ignored because it's inauthentic. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=697.62s)]
*  That of course was when they left the intercept because they wouldn't let me write about it, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=701.6600000000001s)]
*  claiming that there were doubts about its authenticity when I knew there weren't. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=704.1400000000001s)]
*  But that was, and then Twitter and Facebook censored it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=706.98s)]
*  On those kinds of questions like Rechegate, the authenticity of these emails, like for [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=709.9399999999999s)]
*  most Americans, they don't have the competence to judge that because they do other things. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=714.62s)]
*  But when it comes to seeing older people in cognitive decline, most of them have had that [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=718.86s)]
*  experience with like a grandparent or a parent or a sibling or a neighbor or whatever, and [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=724.68s)]
*  don't need to be told by quote unquote experts that is happening because they can see it [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=730.5799999999999s)]
*  with their own eyes. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=735.22s)]
*  And for the media to have sat there for a year and a half and told everybody, as Joe [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=738.0200000000001s)]
*  Scarborough said, this version of Joe Biden is the best Biden we've ever seen. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=742.7s)]
*  I mean, imagine being such a state propagandist that you do that and then keep your job. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=746.9000000000001s)]
*  I think that's why this scandal is so devastating to them and why like when Jake Tapper stands [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=752.1s)]
*  up to write a book saying, I've uncovered the truth with investigative reporting, you [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=755.98s)]
*  know, everybody is reacting with justifiable nausea. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=760.1s)]
*  You got to take some balls to do that though. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=763.98s)]
*  I mean, I famously advocated for the Iraq War realized in 2003 that it was a bad idea [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=766.62s)]
*  and said I was wrong. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=773.3000000000001s)]
*  What I didn't do was write a book saying like it was wrong and I always thought it was wrong. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=775.0600000000001s)]
*  Or like, hey, I'm here to write a book saying why the Iraq War was based on falsehoods. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=780.3000000000001s)]
*  It's like we already know Tucker, thank you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=784.22s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=786.5s)]
*  Like you didn't go and write that book because you were the one helping to perpetuate that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=787.5s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=790.38s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=791.38s)]
*  I guess without repentance, without the acknowledgement of wrongdoing, of dishonesty, without saying [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=792.78s)]
*  I screwed up and making that the headline, nothing that follows is credible at all. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=799.42s)]
*  It's like all fake unless you admit your role in the lie. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=803.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=807.42s)]
*  And if that happened, if you said like, look, I was really swept up in the media bubble [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=808.42s)]
*  I was in and I want to tell the story of why I did this or how I convinced myself of this [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=812.46s)]
*  lie, then there would be some nobility to it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=817.26s)]
*  There would be some value and work. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=820.54s)]
*  This is what I mean. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=822.82s)]
*  Like, you know, I was, there were several people, but myself included, who was, I was [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=823.82s)]
*  bashing the table every day. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=828.46s)]
*  You know, we were compiling tapes of Jake Tapper doing all the things that I had just [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=829.74s)]
*  referenced. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=832.5s)]
*  And I remember at the time, Jake Tapper always serving the Democratic Party in these ways. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=833.5s)]
*  And his initial response was to send out like publicists to try and, you know, plant stories [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=838.7s)]
*  that I was lying, that I was manipulating media. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=845.1800000000001s)]
*  There was one in the Daily Beast, one in the Huffington Post. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=847.26s)]
*  We're actually attacking you. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=848.98s)]
*  Oh yeah, they were pitching stories like, yeah, there's, you know, they were in like [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=850.4599999999999s)]
*  shitty liberal sites that no one, like Huffington Post and the Daily Beast, there was a couple [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=854.54s)]
*  others. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=858.74s)]
*  But they had pitched them like to the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal, I think [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=859.74s)]
*  as well, like New York Post got in contact with me. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=863.9399999999999s)]
*  They didn't, they didn't run it because it was so easy to prove that. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=866.02s)]
*  What was the allegation? [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=869.42s)]
*  That all of these incidents that I just described, and there were others as well of things he [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=871.26s)]
*  did on his show were like taken out of context or the video was manipulated, just like they [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=875.94s)]
*  did when people saw Joe Biden wandering around on that D-Day and had to be, you know, redirected [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=880.98s)]
*  by Georgia Maloney or having been taken off the stage by this. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=886.7s)]
*  That's the other thing. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=890.5s)]
*  They didn't just deny it. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=891.6600000000001s)]
*  They attacked anyone who said it. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=893.4200000000001s)]
*  People in 2024 who were saying, oh, look, Biden clearly doesn't know where he is, including [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=895.6600000000001s)]
*  at that event with Obama, that big George Clooney fundraiser. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=898.94s)]
*  The Washington Post were in an article saying they were using, it was a new phrase, cheap [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=901.94s)]
*  fakes. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=906.0200000000001s)]
*  Like they weren't exactly fake, but the narrative was fake. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=907.0200000000001s)]
*  And it was anyone who said Joe Biden clearly is in cognitive decline. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=911.7s)]
*  If you look at him at these events, they were called right-wing disinformation agents. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=914.58s)]
*  And as it turns out, George Clooney ended up saying, the reason why I wanted Biden not [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=919.9000000000001s)]
*  to run was because the Joe Biden I saw at that event was completely unrecognizable. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=925.1s)]
*  He was like, he has dementia. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=928.66s)]
*  And at the time when people were saying, like, clearly he doesn't know where he is being [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=932.5s)]
*  let off the stage by Barack Obama, none of this was new. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=936.3399999999999s)]
*  This is what we have been seeing for so long. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=940.68s)]
*  The media affirmatively used that disinformation term that has become their weapon of deception [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=942.86s)]
*  and propaganda and smearing people who tell the truth to label all of that disinformation. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=948.14s)]
*  So they were the ones who perpetrated the fraud. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=956.9399999999999s)]
*  And now they're pretending like they're the ones uncovering it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=961.22s)]
*  I think the reason they don't get it is because of that insulated bubble that they exist in. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=964.02s)]
*  They all do believe that they're truthful, they're good, they're benevolent, they're [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=968.98s)]
*  nonpartisan and that unfortunately there was no way for them to have told the story because [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=973.18s)]
*  Mike Donilon was lying about it or Joe Biden was keeping the truth from them. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=978.98s)]
*  And so what can they do? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=983.38s)]
*  So here's a company we're always excited to advertise because we actually use their [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=985.44s)]
*  products every day at Maryweather Farms. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  Remember when everybody knew their neighborhood butcher? [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=991.24s)]
*  You look back and you feel like, oh, there was something really important about that, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=993.74s)]
*  knowing the person who cut your meat. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=997.84s)]
*  And at some point your grandparents knew the people who raised their meat so they could [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1000.48s)]
*  trust what they ate. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1004.62s)]
*  But that time is long gone. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1006.0s)]
*  It's been replaced by an era of grocery store mystery meat boxed by distant beef corporations, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1007.7600000000001s)]
*  none of which raised a single cow. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1014.64s)]
*  Unlike your childhood, they don't know you, they're not interested in you, the whole thing [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1016.3199999999999s)]
*  is creepy. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1020.84s)]
*  The only thing that matters to them is money and God knows what you're eating. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1021.84s)]
*  Maryweather Farms is the answer to that. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1025.2s)]
*  They raise their cattle in the U.S. in Wyoming, Nebraska and Colorado and they prepare their [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1026.96s)]
*  meat themselves in their facilities in this country. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1031.8s)]
*  No middlemen, no outsourcing, no foreign beef sneaking through a back door. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1035.42s)]
*  Nobody wants foreign meat. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1040.12s)]
*  Sorry, we have a great meat, the best meat here in the United States and we buy ours [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1041.44s)]
*  at Maryweather Farms. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  Their cuts are pasture raised, hormone free, antibiotic free and absolutely delicious. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1046.92s)]
*  I gorged on one last night. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1052.0s)]
*  You got to try this for real. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1053.88s)]
*  Every day we eat it. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1055.72s)]

*  I think that kind of self-deception is a byproduct of the tribalism that really defines DC and [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1066.76s)]
*  it's like we can't help the other side. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1074.08s)]
*  Like we're going to start with the other side is evil and anything that helps them we can't [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1076.0s)]
*  do. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1080.44s)]
*  Therefore, we're going to have to make some accommodations that may include lying but [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1081.44s)]
*  it's not really lying. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1083.56s)]
*  It's in the service of a greater good. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1084.56s)]
*  Oh yeah, which is what every person who has ever done anything evil has said to justify [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1085.56s)]
*  it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1090.64s)]
*  I'm not an evil person. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1091.64s)]
*  I'm not a sociopath. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1093.16s)]
*  I'm doing something that seems evil but it's for a greater cause. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1094.16s)]
*  The end is justify the means. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1097.28s)]
*  I mean that's the most basic, basically a moral statement you can have and since the [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1098.28s)]
*  emergence of Trump that is all that journalism has become. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1102.4s)]
*  Not just journalism but so many academia, so many different institutions have renounced [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1106.1200000000001s)]
*  their core function, whatever that might be, science in order to devote themselves to this [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1110.72s)]
*  monomaniacal mission of stopping Donald Trump and his movement. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1117.28s)]
*  Sam Harris, whether through stupidity or just like in an unenviable candor, was the first [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1122.04s)]
*  one who came out with the Hunter Biden laptop stuff after he realized it was a lie and said [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1130.48s)]
*  like yeah, I guess this laptop was true but at the end of the day, I really don't care. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1133.9199999999998s)]
*  If they have to lie about it, fine. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1139.3999999999999s)]
*  The evil of electing Donald Trump is so much greater and he was the first one to really [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1140.6799999999998s)]
*  candidly acknowledge what they are all thinking, which is we'll lie, we'll spread disinformation, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1144.6s)]
*  we'll hide things because the destruction and fear that we have of Donald Trump in power [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1152.52s)]
*  is so great that anything we do to try and impede it is not just justifiable but almost [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1159.0s)]
*  like morally imperative. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1164.32s)]
*  That is how most of these institutions ended up reasoning and that's why they've lost their [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1165.6799999999998s)]
*  credibility. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1170.1599999999999s)]
*  We're all Dietrich Bonhoeffer at this point. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1171.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1172.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's very self-glorifying too, like we're on the front line of fighting fascism. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1173.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, this is such a tired question but I've never really gotten an answer that satisfies [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1175.9199999999998s)]
*  me. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1181.52s)]
*  I mean, I look at Trump and I'm like, you know, this is not a radical person in most [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1182.52s)]
*  ways. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1188.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1189.08s)]
*  And a lot of the things that he says are things that the Democratic Party was like officially [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1190.08s)]
*  for 10 years ago. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1193.8799999999999s)]
*  You know, less wars, pay attention to the forgotten man. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1197.0s)]
*  Free trade is kind of bad. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1200.24s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1201.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1202.52s)]
*  I mean, these are not, he is not a radical right-winger as I would have conceived of [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1203.52s)]
*  a radical right-winger in 1998 or 2018. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1206.8s)]
*  So why, but the Hive like reacted to him like the devil does holy water just like, I can't [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1210.44s)]
*  be near you. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1218.96s)]
*  What is that? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1220.8s)]
*  I still don't fully understand it. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1221.8s)]
*  I think it's two things. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1224.04s)]
*  One less important though still not trivial, which is comportmentally, he's just such a [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1227.56s)]
*  radical departure from the way anybody who has ever gotten close to the presidency has [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1232.94s)]
*  conducted themselves. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1237.2s)]
*  That's fair. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1239.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1240.16s)]
*  But like, but once you understand what that is, you can put it in your proper, in the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1241.68s)]
*  proper context and not go insane about it. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1248.28s)]
*  I remember the time that I realized just how far gone the media was when it came to this [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1250.88s)]
*  and like the political establishment generally, which was during the 2016 campaign when they [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1256.04s)]
*  kept asking about like collusion with Russia and collusion with Russia and all that. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1260.4s)]
*  And he said, I don't know anything about that. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1264.56s)]
*  But hey, Russians, if you're listening, they were asking him, did you participate in the [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1268.1200000000001s)]
*  hacking? [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1271.92s)]
*  And he was like, I didn't have anything to do with that. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1272.92s)]
*  But hey, like Russia, if you're listening, maybe you could find Hillary Clinton's like [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1274.92s)]
*  87,000 deleted emails, which was obviously like a joke, just a joke. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1277.96s)]
*  I have nothing to do with Russia, but if they're such great hackers, maybe they can find the [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1284.76s)]
*  media took that and they for over a year earnestly pretended that this was proof that he was in [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1287.96s)]
*  cahoots with Russia because he submits hacking requests to Russia. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1295.96s)]
*  Like if you have some like back channels, secret relationship with Russia, the way you're [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1299.92s)]
*  going to like submit your request is by standing in front of 130 cameras and be like, hey, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1305.1200000000001s)]
*  Putin, this is my latest hacking request. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1309.92s)]
*  Go find those emails instead of like having a, you know, Don Jr. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1311.88s)]
*  meet in a parking lot with some like Russian agent or whatever. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, but the fact that they were willing to, they really thought that that was a smoking [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1318.56s)]
*  gun and could not understand how Trump jokes, how he uses irony, how he like purposely trolls [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1323.68s)]
*  was, you know, the time that I realized just how far gone they were. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1331.44s)]
*  But I think the bigger reason why they were, I think we've talked about this before is [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1336.88s)]
*  I would say since the end of world war two, maybe before that, but certainly since the [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1342.28s)]
*  end of world war two, what we have more or less is a continuity of core Washington dogma [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1347.04s)]
*  on foreign and economic policy. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1354.1599999999999s)]
*  You have, you know, on the margins, things that make it appear like the parties are so [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  different. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1360.3999999999999s)]
*  They fight about abortion. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1361.3999999999999s)]
*  They do discreet abortion or culture war issues, all of that. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1362.3999999999999s)]
*  But on the question of how power is distributed on how the U S maintains global hegemony on [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1365.28s)]
*  feeding the war machine on how our economic system functions and who it serves. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1371.0s)]
*  There is complete continuity between Republicans and Democrats. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1378.72s)]
*  Like those permanent power factions in Washington, the corporatism, militarism don't care at [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1381.64s)]
*  all who wins because their policies prevail no matter what. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1385.56s)]
*  You can vote for whoever you want. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1390.44s)]
*  You can vote against it. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1391.44s)]
*  You can vote for it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1392.44s)]
*  Doesn't matter. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1393.44s)]
*  It continues. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1394.44s)]
*  Trump by necessity, because the Republicans had already chosen Jeb Bush as their candidate, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1395.44s)]
*  we all expected it was going to be another Bush Clinton race. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1399.78s)]
*  It was going to be Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1402.26s)]
*  That was the assumption that everyone had. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1404.46s)]
*  Hillary would have lost had the DNC not cheated for her, but they did cheat for her. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1409.42s)]
*  So she was the nominee. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1412.5s)]
*  But the only way Trump could break through, how do you break through against all the Republican [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1413.8999999999999s)]
*  money behind Jeb Bush, you have to run against the Bush family. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1416.62s)]
*  You have to run against conservative Republican dogma on both financial economics and foreign [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1418.74s)]
*  policy. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1424.82s)]
*  He ran against the Iraq war. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1425.82s)]
*  He ran against permanent war. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1426.82s)]
*  He ran against serving corporatism at the expense of the working people, against free [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1427.86s)]
*  trade at the expense of having an industrial base. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1431.86s)]
*  He became a kind of threat. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1437.9399999999998s)]
*  Steve Bannon was the architect of the time and Steve Bannon's vision very much was that [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1440.4199999999998s)]
*  like the Republican establishment is at least as bad as the Democratic establishment. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1443.82s)]
*  He was a threat to disrupt this bipartisan continuity on which power factions in Washington [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1448.02s)]
*  depend. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1453.98s)]
*  That's what made him so anathema to so many different factions. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1455.14s)]
*  He was a challenge to the post-war order, basically. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1461.02s)]
*  Like questioning the viability of NATO. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1465.38s)]
*  I know. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1467.54s)]
*  It's like walking into a church and saying, we sure Jesus is divine. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1468.54s)]
*  That alone. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1474.82s)]
*  That actually changed my life when he said that. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1476.74s)]
*  I grew up around NATO, grew up supporting NATO unthinkingly. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1478.38s)]
*  Never thought about NATO. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1482.7s)]
*  NATO's the good guys. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1483.7s)]
*  NATO keeps the Soviets from rolling into Belgium. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1485.42s)]
*  That's good. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1489.02s)]
*  Why is that bad? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1490.02s)]
*  Of course we love NATO. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1491.02s)]
*  Then he was like, hey, but the Soviet Union doesn't exist anymore. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1492.02s)]
*  No one had ever in a lifetime in DC, no one had ever mentioned NATO in a way that challenged [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1495.74s)]
*  me to think about what it was or its role until that. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1500.82s)]
*  He just said it offhandedly. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1503.9s)]
*  I was like, NATO? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1504.9s)]
*  Really? [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1506.9s)]
*  He's against NATO? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1507.9s)]
*  How could you be against NATO? [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1508.9s)]
*  That began a chain of thinking that totally changed my view of everything. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1509.9s)]
*  I think you're right. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1514.74s)]
*  It's dangerous to have people saying stuff like that. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1516.66s)]
*  What you want is continuity with the status quo. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1520.14s)]
*  Who was a more reliable maven of the status quo than Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1523.98s)]
*  That's why they were so desperate, including all the neocons and conservatives that you [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1532.7s)]
*  knew. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1538.42s)]
*  So many of them openly supported Clinton and Biden. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1539.74s)]
*  Many of them, to this day, half the Republican Senate caucus at least hates Trump. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1542.7s)]
*  Hates his ideology, hates his policy. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1546.78s)]
*  They all voted for Kamala. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1548.78s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1549.78s)]
*  You really think Mike Rounds voted for Trump? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1550.78s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1551.78s)]
*  I don't know, but I'm just saying. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1552.78s)]
*  Those types. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1555.26s)]
*  Can I just go back? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1556.26s)]
*  I want to ask you more about that and the place of neoconservatives. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1557.26s)]
*  I guess we're not even to use that term, so think of a new term as I ask. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1561.38s)]
*  All right, I will. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1564.74s)]
*  But before we get to that, you mentioned Russiagate a couple of times in the hacking and the subsequent [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1565.74s)]
*  leaking of those emails from the DNC. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1571.02s)]
*  Who did that? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1573.7s)]
*  It's possible, of course, that the Russians did it. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1578.78s)]
*  Sometimes you get the official story and it's possible. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1583.18s)]
*  I know Julian Assange a long time. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1589.22s)]
*  I know him very well. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1590.78s)]
*  What a good man. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1591.78s)]
*  I think he's one of the heroes of our lifetime. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1592.78s)]
*  I totally agree. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1597.54s)]
*  Not just a hero, but incredibly consequential. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1599.06s)]
*  Just a decent person too. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1601.62s)]
*  Brilliant and courageous. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1603.62s)]
*  Not without his personality flaws, but oftentimes that kind of courage. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1605.78s)]
*  Whenever people used to complain about Julian's difficult personality, let's use the generous [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1609.7s)]
*  term difficult personality, I would always say, who do you think is going to go and spill [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1612.82s)]
*  the secrets of the world's most powerful government? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1618.74s)]
*  You think it's going to be some mild-mannered, gentle, congenial person? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1620.7s)]
*  No, it takes a certain personality type. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1625.54s)]
*  But in any event, he had insinuated several times that it came from within the DNC. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1628.26s)]
*  He had raised the possibility that Seth Rich was murdered because he was the leaker. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1635.3000000000002s)]
*  It was Julian, it was WikiLeaks who ran those docs. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1642.26s)]
*  It was WikiLeaks who received them. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1645.7s)]
*  Yeah, but who shared them with the world. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1647.5400000000002s)]
*  Who then published them all. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1649.5400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1650.8600000000001s)]
*  So it's not a small thing when the guy who runs WikiLeaks suggests something. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1651.8600000000001s)]
*  Correct. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1654.74s)]
*  Instead, if you are the recipient of leaks, as I've been many times, you don't actually [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1656.58s)]
*  know who the kind of ... You're not sure if the person bringing you the leaks is the person [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1661.46s)]
*  who actually engineered it. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1666.3s)]
*  That could be a cut, a go-between. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1667.54s)]
*  But at the same time, Julian is extremely smart. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1673.06s)]
*  I talked to him this day. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1676.26s)]
*  He's, I think, not fully recovered. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1677.42s)]
*  He'll never be. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1679.74s)]
*  his brain is just like a font of insight. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1681.74s)]
*  I trust his judgment so much. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1689.14s)]
*  You can go back and look at stuff he said, and it proved to be so prescient. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1690.86s)]
*  When he says that, I do think Julian sees himself, for good reason, as an enemy of the [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1696.7s)]
*  intelligence agencies in the West. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1701.74s)]
*  I mean, he is that. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1703.66s)]
*  So, none doubt it. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1705.1s)]
*  Well, he did like seven and a half years in confinement because of it. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1706.1s)]
*  Eight years in the Ecuadorian embassy, and then four and a half years in the prison that [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1709.9399999999998s)]
*  the BBC calls the British Guantanamo. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1713.02s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, the head of CIA, plotted his assassination. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1716.58s)]
*  Plotted his assassination, badgered the Ecuadorians into lifting the asylum they had given him [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1719.86s)]
*  and promised him, and allowed the London police to go in and coerced, threatened, bribed the [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1724.4199999999998s)]
*  Ecuadorians to lift that grant of asylum so that they could then go in. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1731.1799999999998s)]
*  Mike Pompeo is like first month as CIA director gave a speech saying, we're going to destroy [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1735.98s)]
*  WikiLeaks. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1740.9s)]
*  It's time that they stop hiding behind the First Amendment. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1741.9s)]
*  So he was very serious about that. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1745.18s)]
*  Mike Pompeo should be charged with plotting someone's assassination. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1748.06s)]
*  That's a crime. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1751.82s)]
*  You can't do that in the United States. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1752.82s)]
*  I mean, there's so many things Mike Pompeo should be charged with, but we know for certain [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1753.82s)]
*  that he was wanting, I mean, he was the CIA director thinking, oh, now I get to murder [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1756.98s)]
*  people who I want. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1761.86s)]
*  Yeah, who embarrassed me, who've never been charged. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1763.02s)]
*  Who committed crimes. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1764.98s)]
*  He'd never been charged with a crime in the United States when that... [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1765.98s)]
*  Until like until 2018, when they engineered this, you know, obscenely baseless indictment [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1768.54s)]
*  that they knew, they never wanted to bring him to the United States to stand trial. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1777.18s)]
*  He would never have been convicted. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1780.6200000000001s)]
*  They wanted to break him psychologically and physically, and they came very close to doing [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1783.14s)]
*  that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1788.5s)]
*  But in any event, so when Julian Assange says something like that, part of me knows that [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1789.5s)]
*  he views himself as an enemy of the intelligence agencies and wants to use the same methods [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1793.6599999999999s)]
*  they use, which is sometimes he spreads disinformation for confusion. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1798.06s)]
*  But I also believe that he believes there's something to it. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1802.6999999999998s)]
*  And so we never had a real investigation into anything relating to Rejigate at all, because [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1806.1399999999999s)]
*  in the first term, Trump was, you know, that whole administration was commandeered. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1814.26s)]
*  It was run by people who were opposed to. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1819.34s)]
*  This is Trump's agenda, for the most part. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1823.8200000000002s)]
*  And part of this new administration is constructed to avoid that from happening. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1826.78s)]
*  And I think they are now going back and looking at a lot of these things. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1831.1000000000001s)]
*  So we're not positive that cryptocurrency is the future of finance, but we do know that [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1835.14s)]
*  what we have now is broken and dangerous. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1838.5800000000002s)]
*  Debt has never been higher in this country. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1841.7s)]
*  Many of our so-called leaders are getting rich, serving you. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1843.54s)]
*  It's a scam. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1846.66s)]
*  So where does it go? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1847.66s)]
*  Well, thankfully, there are options. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1848.94s)]
*  Donald Trump has said repeatedly he wants the United States to be the crypto capital [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1851.14s)]
*  of the world. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1854.42s)]
*  He's already created the Crypto Advisory Council and recently signed an executive order to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1855.42s)]
*  establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1859.26s)]
*  This could give normal people an alternative to the government's failing system and frankly [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1862.0200000000002s)]
*  to the US dollar. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1866.42s)]
*  I'm not saying put all your money outside the US dollar, but like, don't be crazy. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1867.42s)]
*  Don't be stupid here. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1871.3400000000001s)]
*  You can see where it's going. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1872.3400000000001s)]
*  So the people at I Trust Capital can help you get in to this. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1873.5400000000002s)]
*  It's complicated for people who aren't following it. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1877.5s)]
*  They make it easy. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1880.06s)]
*  They're based 100% in the United States of America. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1881.06s)]
*  We looked into this. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1883.4199999999998s)]
*  They service only American investors and they operate the only platform that allows you [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1884.4199999999998s)]
*  to buy and sell crypto 24-7, both inside and outside of your tax-advantaged IRA. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1888.94s)]
*  It all happens on one easy-to-use dashboard. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1894.26s)]
*  They also operate a closed loop system, meaning that bad actors can't access your account [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1897.26s)]
*  and steal your money. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1901.98s)]
*  So if you're considering adding Bitcoin if you want to or some other cryptocurrency portfolio, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1903.7s)]

*  I don't know. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1922.66s)]
*  I don't like to... [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1925.46s)]
*  I'm open to it. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1926.46s)]
*  I'm definitely open to it, but I'm not going to affirm it. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1928.1000000000001s)]
*  I think it's very strange. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1931.26s)]
*  Or say it's probable. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1932.26s)]
*  I got from an MPD, Metropolitan Police Department officer, who was a friend of mine, the fact, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1933.26s)]
*  which I've checked, which is that the FBI immediately took over the murder investigation. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1937.86s)]
*  Why would the FBI... [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1941.3s)]
*  Of a routine, supposedly routine, random... [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1942.3s)]
*  Attempted robbery. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1945.02s)]
*  ...DC-type attempted robbery. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1946.02s)]
*  Why would the FBI take that over? [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1947.02s)]
*  Is there a good reason for that? [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1949.06s)]
*  That's bizarre. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1950.9799999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1951.9799999999998s)]
*  That's why I say I'm open to it, even though that's been something that is immediately [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1954.8999999999999s)]
*  branded like such an obvious conspiracy theory that the second you suggest that you're receptive [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1959.6399999999999s)]
*  But that's exactly when conspiracy theories are often ones that deserve attention. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1964.9s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1969.5400000000002s)]
*  An American citizen got murdered in my city, and so I feel like I have an absolute right [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1970.5400000000002s)]
*  to ask why the FBI take that over and what did they learn and what is that? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1974.02s)]
*  That's a totally fair question. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1977.76s)]
*  They don't... [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1979.1000000000001s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1980.1000000000001s)]
*  They set themselves up as the arbiters of everything, as the moral arbiters for sure, [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1981.1000000000001s)]
*  and you're not allowed to ask that question. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1985.2800000000002s)]
*  I spent my life in DC. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1987.38s)]

*  real investigation into this? [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1998.26s)]
*  This seems anomalous. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=1999.94s)]
*  What's the answer? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2000.94s)]
*  Shut up! [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2001.94s)]
*  Shut up! [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2002.94s)]
*  And then the tactic is by the bench peers of the world and the people who are the people [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2003.94s)]
*  who have anointed themselves to be the guardians of official versions or no challenging any [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2008.46s)]

*  Yeah, it was a long time ago. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2022.1s)]
*  And the president got murdered. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2023.1s)]

*  don't know the answer to most things. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2053.9s)]
*  Like I said, where do you think those emails came from? [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2055.3s)]
*  Podesta's emails, DNC emails. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2058.7s)]
*  And you're like, I don't really know. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2060.14s)]
*  But here are the questions that I have. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2062.02s)]
*  Like that's the honest answer. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2063.02s)]
*  Well, also, you know how many times not just in politics where deliberate lies happen, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2064.54s)]
*  but in every field of discipline, like physics and chemistry and biology, everything linguistics, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2069.54s)]

*  Like if you don't have, and that's why I believe in the absolute necessity of preserving the [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2084.4199999999996s)]
*  right to question everything. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2090.06s)]
*  That's the scientific method. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2091.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2092.06s)]
*  And it's just basic humility. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2093.06s)]
*  It's like to think that human beings have discovered unchallenged truths that can never [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2094.06s)]
*  be disproven and that from here and forth, you're not allowed to question. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2098.3399999999997s)]
*  No, I'm not accepting that from anybody. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2101.98s)]
*  Oh, I want to print that and put it on my fridge. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2105.9s)]
*  I'll give you, I'll sign it for you. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2108.7400000000002s)]
*  Good. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2111.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2112.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2113.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2114.3s)]
*  So let me, let me do the EPSTEAM. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2115.3s)]
*  Do you want to talk about the EPSTEAM files and relations with that as well? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2116.3s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2119.02s)]
*  I mean, just because I just want to, I just find the EPSTEAM files so fascinating because [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2120.02s)]
*  all the people who are now in charge of the government under Donald Trump, particularly [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2126.26s)]
*  like Cash Patel and Dan Bongino at the FBI, but others as well throughout the government, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2131.1s)]
*  were over the last four years, everywhere in the media, on their shows, on every other [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2136.46s)]
*  show banging on the table, demanding the immediate release of all the EPSTEAM files. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2140.94s)]
*  We're now five months into the Trump administration. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2147.18s)]
*  We haven't gotten a single document that wasn't previously published of the EPSTEAM files. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2150.4s)]
*  They made a humiliating showing of pretending to release it when they called those conservative [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2157.94s)]
*  influence and they all waved around the binder. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2162.46s)]
*  EPSTEAM files, we were like, Oh my God, what was in them? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2163.9s)]
*  And then it turns out like nothing. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2165.82s)]
*  You know, just every document that was in this binder was already previous releases, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2167.34s)]
*  part of the litigation or journalism that was done. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2171.06s)]
*  And the Pam Bondi's new excuse, because I mean, I'm glad that there are a lot of people [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2174.7000000000003s)]
*  in the Trump movement and the mug movement who are not contrary to how they're depicted [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2178.82s)]
*  in some sort of cult. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2183.98s)]
*  They hold these people accountable. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2185.8999999999996s)]
*  They want to understand, we were promised these things. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2188.3399999999997s)]
*  Why isn't this happening? [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2191.2999999999997s)]
*  And so Pam Bondi's excuse now is we have thousands and thousands of sex videos of Jeffrey Epstein [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2192.8199999999997s)]
*  having sex with minors, implying that it's obviously going to take a lot of time to go [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2200.22s)]
*  through these videos and therefore we have to be patient before we get them. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2204.7s)]
*  It's like, I don't care about sex videos of Jeffrey Epstein having sex with children [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2210.62s)]
*  because we already know that Jeffrey Epstein had sex with children. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2216.62s)]
*  That's kind of the reason we know who he is. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2219.38s)]
*  He's been twice charged with that, once convicted and then was ready to be charged again. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2222.1s)]
*  For me, the two biggest issues are, are there people to whom he trafficked minors because [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2227.18s)]
*  he was charged with sex trafficking, but nobody has been charged with being the recipient [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2232.94s)]
*  of that sex trafficking. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2237.06s)]
*  The much more interesting question for me is, and there's a lot of reason to believe [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2238.86s)]
*  it's true, is was he working with or for any foreign intelligence agencies? [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2243.5800000000004s)]
*  There is no way they don't already have that answer. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2249.6600000000003s)]
*  Maybe the answer is no. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2252.42s)]
*  Maybe he wasn't working with any. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2254.54s)]
*  It would shock me, but maybe that's their answer. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2256.02s)]
*  Maybe their answer is he was. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2259.34s)]
*  Why don't we have those answers? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2260.78s)]
*  Have FBI agents for whatever reason go through those sex tapes for the next three years, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2262.6200000000003s)]
*  that's fine. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2265.6600000000003s)]
*  What stops them from releasing that question? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2266.6600000000003s)]
*  So for people who may not be as familiar with the details, what leads you to raise that [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2268.54s)]
*  question? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2275.46s)]
*  Is there evidence that suggests he might have been working with the foreign intelligence? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2276.46s)]
*  Well, first of all, the source of his wealth has always been mysterious. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2280.14s)]
*  He wasn't just very rich. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2285.86s)]
*  He was living the life of a multi-multi-billionaire. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2287.46s)]
*  He had $50 million properties in Manhattan and West Palm Beach and bought that island, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2290.34s)]
*  flying around on a 747. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2297.46s)]
*  This is not just somebody who's very wealthy. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2299.1s)]
*  This is somebody with essentially unlimited resources, like Bill Gates type wealth. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2301.08s)]
*  One of the ways, one of his primary benefactors is Les Wexner, who is a multi-billionaire, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2308.2s)]
*  somebody with whom he worked closely. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2315.06s)]
*  I guess the argument or the claim is he was a brilliant strategist for how to save money [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2316.38s)]
*  on taxes. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2324.66s)]
*  He was like a highly competent accountant, basically. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2326.06s)]
*  Yeah, like a tax accountant. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2328.3399999999997s)]
*  That's tax accountant. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2329.3399999999997s)]
*  They tell you what strategies to use to save money. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2330.3399999999997s)]
*  So maybe Les Wexner valued him so much that he gave him, I don't know, $3 billion. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2333.22s)]
*  In general, billionaires don't like to give money away that they don't have to. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2338.18s)]
*  Maybe Les Wexner is like super generous, like, oh, so gratefully, Jeffrey Epstein, here's [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  like $2 billion. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2345.2599999999998s)]
*  But Les Wexner has all sorts of ties to his main non-moneymaking endeavor in life is supporting [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2347.3799999999997s)]
*  Israel and donating to pro-Israel groups and working closely with the Israeli government. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2355.74s)]
*  Jisane Maxwell, who's now in prison as having been essentially his right-hand man, her father, [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2362.46s)]
*  Robert Maxwell, who died in a very mysterious way, he slipped off his yacht, was a known [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2368.2999999999997s)]
*  Mossad agent. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2374.7799999999997s)]
*  He worked with the Mossad. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2375.7799999999997s)]
*  He had very close ties to Israel. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2376.7799999999997s)]
*  We all know he is- [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  He was given a state funeral. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2380.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes, in Israel. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2381.7799999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2382.7799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, when I did the Snowden reporting, people, there's a lot of documents that we [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2383.98s)]
*  released that, and just because there were so many, not all of them got the attention [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2387.7400000000002s)]
*  they deserved. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2391.7400000000002s)]
*  One of the set of files we released described the intelligence relationship that we have [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2392.7400000000002s)]
*  with Israel, the NSA has with Israel. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2399.9s)]
*  Israel is the number one recipient of NSA technology and NSA intelligence. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2402.6200000000003s)]
*  We share more with Israel, even more than we do with the Five Eyes partners who develop [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2406.7400000000002s)]
*  this technology. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2411.94s)]
*  We give more to Israel, more intelligence, raw intelligence about Americans as well, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2413.1s)]
*  and more intelligence know-how. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2418.34s)]
*  But at the same time, the documents that describe who are our greatest intelligence threats, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2421.58s)]
*  who are our greatest intelligence adversaries, who spies on us the most, who is capable of [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2427.5s)]
*  spying out the most, number one on the list is Israel as well. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2431.86s)]
*  Obviously, the Israelis use, you know, some, I mean, the most dangerous spying programs [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2435.1s)]
*  like Pegasus and others come from Israel, are developed by Israel, are controlled by [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2440.22s)]
*  the Israelis, by which I simply mean to say that Israel uses every weapon at its disposal, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2445.2999999999997s)]
*  including gathering and incriminating information about its enemies. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2451.14s)]
*  Some people have suggested that, oh no, it's not Israel, it's probably the Qatari intelligence [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2454.8199999999997s)]
*  agencies with whom he worked. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2459.2999999999997s)]
*  Maybe it was like, maybe it was Peru, maybe it was like Indonesia. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2461.86s)]
*  People have said that Epstein was working with the Qataris? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2465.7799999999997s)]
*  I want to keep a list of people who make that claim. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2468.8999999999996s)]
*  Do you know anyone? [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2472.5s)]
*  It's pretty funny. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2473.5s)]
*  You know how like Israeli, like supporters, like loyalists of Israel in the United States [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2476.5s)]
*  are now constantly trying to convince people that the real foreign government that is exerting [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2482.5s)]
*  extreme amounts of influence over our politicians and our institutions is Qatar? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2487.9399999999996s)]
*  I find it hilarious. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2492.9799999999996s)]
*  And I'm always like, you know what? [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2493.9799999999996s)]
*  Let me know when Congress starts passing on a weekly basis pro-Qatar resolutions or when [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2495.94s)]
*  like students are being expelled and deported because they've criticized Qatar. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2500.7400000000002s)]
*  Let me know when like we start sending billions of dollars a year to Qatar. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2506.6200000000003s)]
*  Let me know when all that starts to happen and I'll be receptive to the fact that maybe [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2511.38s)]
*  Qatar... [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2514.2200000000003s)]
*  But anyway, I'm not saying it's Israel. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2515.3s)]
*  I'm just saying the nature of what Jeffrey Epstein was doing, the amount of wealth that [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2517.7000000000003s)]
*  it required, the number of the most powerful elites on the planet who were with him, who [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2525.3s)]
*  were involved with him, who were at his island too, despite knowing that he had been convicted [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2530.2200000000003s)]
*  in 2010 of having sex with minors, hiring prostitutes who were underage, who continued [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2534.3s)]
*  to consort with him in the most proximate ways. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2542.6000000000004s)]
*  Something was going on there. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2548.42s)]
*  It would be incredibly valuable. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2549.46s)]
*  He had cameras in every part of his house. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2551.94s)]
*  He had tapes of everything. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2554.54s)]
*  Obviously that would be of immense value to any foreign intelligence agent. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2557.42s)]
*  And American. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2560.86s)]
*  He was close friends with Bill Burns. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2562.1s)]
*  Maybe domestic intelligence agencies as well. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2564.94s)]
*  But it really is starting to inflame my suspicions a great deal every day that goes by. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2567.34s)]
*  Well, we're not getting that information, particularly because the people who have it [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2574.34s)]
*  are the people who spent years demanding its release and promising to facilitate it if [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2578.02s)]
*  they got into power. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2581.54s)]
*  You're probably pretty sick in Nike. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2583.1400000000003s)]
*  It's hard to blame you for feeling that way. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2584.6200000000003s)]
*  Any company that worships Colin Kaepernick, any company that shills for the lunacy of [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2586.2200000000003s)]
*  the left social agenda is clearly not on your side. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2591.7000000000003s)]
*  In fact, they're your enemy. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2594.34s)]
*  You need an alternative. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2596.1s)]
*  XXXY Athletics is the far better choice. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2597.82s)]
*  It's the only athletic brand committed to fighting for free speech, women's sports, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2602.06s)]
*  and the truth. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2607.62s)]
*  Honesty. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2609.02s)]
*  The truth. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2610.02s)]
*  They're not going to lie to you. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2611.02s)]
*  For example, did you know that 80% of Americans oppose letting men play in women's sports? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2612.02s)]
*  That's not a radical view. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2617.9s)]
*  It's a moderate, sensible view rooted in biology. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2619.54s)]
*  But woke corporations like Nike make you feel like a lunatic for saying obvious things like [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2623.58s)]
*  men are men and women are women. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2628.14s)]
*  That is tyranny. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2630.06s)]
*  How can you fight back? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2631.94s)]
*  by abandoning the companies promoting it and by embracing companies like XXXY Athletics. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2633.1s)]
*  It's an American company. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2639.56s)]
*  It's not opposed to the United States or to telling the truth. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2641.6s)]
*  Head to the truth fits.com to learn a lot more and use the code TUCKER25 for 25% off. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2646.2799999999997s)]
*  Two facts, data points are now called that suggest to me that something's up. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2653.62s)]
*  One is the fact that Epstein was represented in his first time with the authorities in [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2660.02s)]
*  Florida by Bill Crystal's lawyer, Jay Lefkowitz, and who I know. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2665.82s)]
*  And the second is the statement by Alex Acosta, which I think maybe is at the top of your [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2672.7s)]
*  memory about why Epstein got off so easily. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2676.64s)]
*  How is this not talked about every day? [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2680.08s)]
*  Okay, so in Florida, in the United States, generally having sex with minors, hiring, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2682.42s)]
*  using minors as prostitutes is considered like a pretty terrible crime. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2689.3399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, it's yeah, you know, most people agree on that. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2694.2599999999998s)]
*  You don't have to debate that that's considered like something that deserves huge amounts [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2696.2599999999998s)]
*  of jail time and typically results in huge amounts of jail time. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2700.18s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein barely went to jail for that. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2704.54s)]
*  As part of a plea bargain. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2707.74s)]
*  They had enormous amounts of evidence. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2709.7s)]
*  It wasn't a question of could they prove his guilt. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2711.94s)]
*  They gave him a plea deal, a plea deal where he spent like six seconds in jail and then [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2714.7400000000002s)]
*  like most of the time at home doing community service. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2719.98s)]
*  And Alex Acosta, who was the US attorney for the Southern District of Florida at the time, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2723.78s)]
*  which was in charge of the case, that's where Epstein was, ultimately ended up in the Justice [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2728.7s)]
*  Department and other roles inside the government. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2734.26s)]
*  And so he was constantly asked, why would you give Jeffrey Epstein such a like generous [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2736.54s)]
*  plea deal that nobody would ever get for those crimes? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2742.2999999999997s)]
*  And he ended up saying, I was told that he's intelligence and therefore leave him alone. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2745.58s)]
*  That's what Alex Acosta, the prosecutor says that he was told about what he should do with [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2751.3799999999997s)]
*  the Jeffrey, like leave him alone because he's intelligent. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2755.62s)]
*  Well, there were, we're just kind of, the conversation just like ended, like we know [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2758.22s)]
*  now. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2762.58s)]
*  I mean, if the prosecutor says, the federal prosecutor in Florida says that, then I think [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2763.58s)]
*  we can assume that that's true. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2767.66s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2769.58s)]
*  So why don't we know what that means? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2770.8199999999997s)]
*  That's what, like, what would be the reason that people inside the Trump administration, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2772.54s)]
*  who have long expressed vehemently, vocally at the top of their agenda, demands that the [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2778.8199999999997s)]
*  Epstein files be released? [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2785.18s)]
*  Why are they not telling us that information? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2787.5s)]
*  I think the net effect of this is to drive everyone insane and to make everyone like [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2791.54s)]
*  angry and suspicious and paranoid and conspiracy minded. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2796.5s)]
*  I do think that it's like you expect that we're going to hear the truth and then it's [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2800.02s)]
*  like, oh, by the way, no, everyone assumes the worst. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2804.38s)]
*  I mean, why wouldn't you assume the worst? [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2808.5s)]
*  That improves American society. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2811.1s)]
*  The thing is like, you know, I, whenever I talk about independent media, including for [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2812.46s)]
*  people who are supporters of it, believe it's a positive development, they all say, oh, [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2816.58s)]
*  but you know, there's so many conspiracy theories that end up being cultivated and spread that [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2820.86s)]
*  people embrace. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2826.58s)]
*  And that's true. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2828.3s)]
*  There's been a lot of conspiracy theories embraced by the credible legacy media as well. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2829.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't like Reddit that convinced Americans, Saddam Hussein had an active nuclear [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2833.6200000000003s)]
*  weapons program. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2837.6600000000003s)]
*  Or that Joe Biden was the best version ever. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2838.6600000000003s)]
*  Right. Or that like the North Vietnamese were the aggressors in the Gulf of Tonkin. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2840.5800000000004s)]
*  Right. That came from like CBS and Walter Cronkite and the New York Times. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2845.3s)]
*  But in any event, of course, there's going to be Americans who are now amenable to every [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2849.54s)]
*  conspiracy theory, because what have we lived through? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2855.86s)]
*  The Iraq War, the 2008 financial crisis, all of the lies from 9-11 itself. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2857.94s)]
*  And then if you go back further, like the Vietnam War, but then also COVID. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2865.34s)]
*  And like one after the next, at best, massive fundamental systemic failure on the part of [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2869.7000000000003s)]
*  all the institutions we were taught to trust, and probably at worst and probably more accurately, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2877.2200000000003s)]
*  and lies and falsehoods and propaganda continuously disseminated by them in order to facilitate [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2883.54s)]
*  what they wanted. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2890.1s)]
*  What is going to happen to a society where people lose faith and trust in institutions, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2891.54s)]
*  not because, you know, charlatans are on the sidelines encouraging them to make that happen, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2897.22s)]
*  but because rationally, those institutions no longer merit trust or faith. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2902.02s)]
*  If you lie too much, I don't believe you. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2907.38s)]
*  It's kind of basic. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2909.18s)]
*  So the only antidote to that is transparency, is revealing the truth. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2910.86s)]
*  And I really worry right now, especially, that this is hardening people's cynicism [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2915.34s)]
*  and rage and really at some point nihilism, like nothing is true. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2921.7799999999997s)]
*  That is the conclusion a lot of people are going to, nothing is true. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2928.14s)]
*  I don't believe anything. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2930.22s)]
*  Like it's all fake. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2931.22s)]
*  And also, you know, Cash Patel and Dan Bongino are people who were among the most popular [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2932.22s)]
*  among the MAGA base. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2940.54s)]
*  I mean, these were the people among the most respected. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2941.98s)]
*  I mean, Dan Bongino's show on Rumble, a platform that still maybe like 30, 40, maybe even 50% [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2944.8199999999997s)]
*  of the people in the United States have never even heard of, was getting bigger audiences [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2951.4599999999996s)]
*  than almost every daytime cable show. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2956.3399999999997s)]
*  Cash Patel, you know, the surge of support for him when he was nominated to lead the [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2960.7799999999997s)]
*  FBI was massive because people thought, no, that's who we need to like get in and root [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2964.8199999999997s)]
*  this out and clean it out. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2970.02s)]
*  And I believe that they, I believe there is something to that. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2971.8999999999996s)]
*  I think they are authentic and genuine in that way. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2975.8999999999996s)]
*  But at the same time, something is constraining them. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2979.8599999999997s)]
*  And so I asked myself, what kinds of truths would people be determined to hide who are [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2983.2999999999997s)]
*  more powerful than they are? [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2991.14s)]
*  And when it comes to the Epstein files, I continuously zero in on that question of who [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2993.58s)]
*  was he working with or for whom? [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=2999.7799999999997s)]
*  And I can see people in government not wanting that answer to be disclosed, just like the [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3002.3799999999997s)]
*  same reason we didn't have the JFK files and still don't. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3008.06s)]
*  We still don't. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3011.14s)]
*  It's 65 years. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3012.14s)]
*  I know Bongino well. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3014.22s)]
*  I think of him as a friend. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3015.8199999999997s)]
*  I think he is a man of integrity and I think his integrity remains pure because of his [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3017.3399999999997s)]
*  rage. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3022.7s)]
*  Like Dan's mad at lying. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3023.7s)]
*  And so I do, I don't know what's going on at all. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3026.22s)]
*  And to be clear, he said, I know that Epstein killed himself because I've seen the evidence. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3030.5s)]
*  So I'm pretty confident in the case of Dan Bongino. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3034.46s)]
*  I don't even mind that. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3037.9s)]
*  But then the question still becomes like they said. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3038.9s)]
*  They know how their supporters are going to react to that. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3040.9s)]
*  And they were among the people raising doubts about whether Epstein killed himself. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3045.5s)]
*  I wouldn't shock me if Epstein killed himself. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3051.06s)]
*  Like you live a life of great wealth and then suddenly you know you're going to spend the [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3053.34s)]
*  rest of your life in prison. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3055.54s)]
*  It seems odd to me that you can go to a federal prison and kill yourself. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3058.46s)]
*  Like there's not safeguards against that. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3061.26s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3062.7400000000002s)]
*  Things that are run by the government failed. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3064.98s)]
*  I'm not suggesting that they're lying about that. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3066.3s)]
*  But even there, they're saying like, look, I promise you we read the files. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3069.66s)]
*  He killed himself. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3073.3399999999997s)]
*  So then my question is, well, why can't we read those files? [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3074.3399999999997s)]
*  Well, that is my question too. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3076.38s)]
*  And I would just say in the case of Bongino, I know Cash Patel, but I'm not like a friend [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3078.62s)]
*  of Cash Patel's. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3082.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm a friend of Bongino's and I do think that will come out. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3083.7799999999997s)]
*  But I think big picture DOJ is making a huge mistake, huge mistake in promising to reveal [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3086.7799999999997s)]
*  things and then not revealing them. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3094.74s)]
*  And that gives the whole country a kind of moral blue balls at that point. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3097.5s)]
*  And it's bad. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3101.02s)]
*  It's really bad. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3102.02s)]
*  Like it's going to cause a lot of hate. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3103.02s)]
*  And second, I think that we underestimate the physical threat that people in Washington [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3105.82s)]
*  face. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3110.3s)]
*  It's always like blackmail or ideological affinity that gets people. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3111.3s)]
*  People are afraid of getting hurt. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3114.7s)]
*  I do think that's a component. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3115.86s)]
*  I mean, I know that's a component here. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3116.86s)]
*  I mean, political assassination, political murder has been going on for as long as politics [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3118.98s)]
*  have. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3123.58s)]
*  The JFK case is an example of the president of the United States having his head blown [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3124.62s)]
*  off. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3128.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3129.34s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3130.34s)]
*  And you think that that's not ever present or constantly present in the minds of people [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3131.34s)]
*  in Washington. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3134.8199999999997s)]
*  They killed the president, got away with it for over 60 years. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3135.8199999999997s)]
*  So like clearly there are forces that are above justice. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3139.06s)]
*  Oh no, don't worry. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3142.1s)]
*  Lee Harvey Oswald was killed and Jack Ruby went to prison. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3143.1s)]
*  Jack Ruby. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3146.1s)]
*  The whole story is Jack Ruby, by the way. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3147.1s)]
*  The whole story is Jack Ruby. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3150.7s)]
*  I mean, he just walked up to the person they had claimed and just shot him in the stomach. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3152.1s)]
*  And there's no evidence he even liked the Kennedys. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3157.5s)]
*  There's zero evidence. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3160.02s)]
*  He never campaigned for them, never gave them money. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3161.02s)]
*  There's not one person who's ever come forward to say, you know, Jack Ruby was passionately [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3164.2599999999998s)]
*  attached to JFK. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3167.82s)]
*  Not one person. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3169.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3170.06s)]
*  So like what was the motive there? [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3171.06s)]
*  He was clearly sent there to silence Lee Harvey Oswald. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3172.06s)]
*  So by whom is the obvious question. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3176.46s)]
*  There are very serious indications by whom. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3178.18s)]
*  Whatever, I don't know. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3180.98s)]
*  But I don't know why everyone spends all this time on Lee Harvey Oswald when the key to [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3182.6600000000003s)]
*  the story is so clearly Jack Ruby. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3187.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is, I think we are so indoctrinated to believe that this sort of thing happens [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3190.3s)]
*  in other countries. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3196.7000000000003s)]
*  Like how much, think about how much we've heard, for example, about Putin and Albany. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3197.7000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3201.54s)]
*  And we're all supposed to like obsess on the idea that in Russia, you know, if you get [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3202.54s)]
*  too much influence, you become too much of a threat to somebody, you get killed or imprisoned. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3207.14s)]
*  The funny thing is Putin didn't even kill Navalny. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3211.1s)]
*  I think everybody, the CIA says that. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3214.02s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3216.66s)]
*  There's no, yeah, exactly. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3217.66s)]
*  After months of, well, of course, I got blamed for his murder. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3219.18s)]
*  I was in Russia when he died. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3222.22s)]
*  Oh yeah, that's right. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3223.54s)]
*  I remember that timing. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3224.54s)]
*  You were going to go, you had your big Putin interview and then like two days earlier Putin [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3226.18s)]
*  killed Albany and you're like there with Putin. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3229.18s)]
*  No, but that's a big part of how that propaganda works. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3233.1s)]
*  I grew up thinking that like these kind of bad things happen. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3236.14s)]
*  They just don't happen in our country. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3239.46s)]
*  It must be cool to live, you live outside the country famously. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3241.06s)]
*  Where, you know, you're a foreigner living in a country, you've been a long time, you [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3245.14s)]
*  speak the language, you're engaged in the politics, so you're like part of it, but you're [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3249.7s)]
*  also from the United States. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3253.3399999999997s)]
*  So you're not coming at it with that baggage. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3254.8199999999997s)]
*  You can see, you're just like, you don't lie to yourself about what it is. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3257.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I do think, I think one of the great, one of the things for which I'm most grateful [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3260.94s)]
*  is that I was never embedded in the DC political and media scene. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3266.18s)]
*  And obviously you removed yourself from it, which is why we're here and not in Georgetown. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3271.74s)]
*  It didn't help me being a part of that at all. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3275.94s)]
*  I'll tell you, there's a, I've had a friendly relationship with Alex Thompson for a while. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3279.7799999999997s)]
*  I've been, you know, Jake Tapper's co-author in that book. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3287.06s)]
*  Yeah, so now works at Axios. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3290.8199999999997s)]
*  And I've been very aggressive about praising him, like going back two years when he was [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3293.8599999999997s)]
*  one of the only ones working for these news outlets who was on the story of Biden's cognitive [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3297.2s)]
*  decline, getting mauled and attacked by the entire democratic party. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3302.66s)]
*  I was often praising him and defending him. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3306.02s)]
*  You know, I mean, I wouldn't say we're great friends, but you know, he like sent me a copy [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3309.06s)]
*  of the book with very nice words. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3312.2999999999997s)]
*  And so when I go to attack Jake Tapper, which is essentially attacking that book, of course [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3313.7s)]
*  there's a part of my brain that like, you know, thinks about like, wait, what is that [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3320.2999999999997s)]
*  going to do to my relationship with Alex Thompson? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3324.14s)]
*  And then you have to be like, I don't care. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3326.3799999999997s)]
*  But if that is your life, you know, I mean, Alex Thompson is not like an important close [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3328.9399999999996s)]
*  friend of mine, but like if you live in Washington and every, your whole social scene is integrated [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  into that is why there's no adversarial relationship between the media. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3339.9799999999996s)]
*  You know, funny, so funny. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3343.58s)]
*  Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson were on that shitty PBS show that is now hosted by Jeffrey [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3346.54s)]
*  Goldberg. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3351.86s)]
*  So can you imagine the Washington- [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3352.86s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg is a PBS show? [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3353.86s)]
*  Yeah, it's like The Week in Washington. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3354.86s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg hosts a TV show? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3356.86s)]
*  Yeah, a PBS, like The Week in Washington. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3358.66s)]
*  He's the most unappealing person. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3360.86s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3361.86s)]
*  You can't find anyone less telegenic. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3362.86s)]
*  But anyway, he is the person that sits there like, anyway, Jeffrey Goldberg was defending [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3364.46s)]
*  the media saying like, I think it's outrageous that we're being blamed for this whole thing [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3371.66s)]
*  with Biden and cognitive decline when there was nothing we could do. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3375.62s)]
*  And so at the end, he said to Jake Tapper, like, what is the lesson that we have to take [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3378.62s)]
*  from all this? [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3381.66s)]
*  And Jake Tapper was got very serious. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3382.66s)]
*  He like furred his brow, but he only like looked down at the table because he just, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3383.94s)]
*  it was a very weird thing. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3387.98s)]
*  Like he's just kind of, you know, he's on television every day. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3388.98s)]
*  You know, you look up, you talk to people, you engage. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3391.06s)]
*  He was like looking down, he had his head bowed, like the face of somebody who has a [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3393.14s)]
*  PR crisis firm. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3397.02s)]
*  He said, what I have realized is that you cannot trust what people in power tell you. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3400.58s)]
*  People in power lie. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3410.9s)]
*  And when they tell you things, you have to take it with skepticism. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3413.18s)]
*  You cannot take it on face value. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3417.02s)]
*  So Jake Tapper at 56 years old, after 30 years of working in journalism, has discovered what, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3418.7799999999997s)]
*  if I were to teach college freshmen a class on journalism would be the thing that I would [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3426.32s)]
*  say on the first day about what the job is, right? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3430.2400000000002s)]
*  Like why it's important to have journalism because people in power lie to keep their [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3434.0800000000004s)]
*  power. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3438.0s)]
*  And this is something that now that Trump's in office, they've suddenly discovered is [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3439.84s)]
*  an important thing to do to be adversarial to people in power. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3444.5800000000004s)]
*  And I think that is in their mind, like there is an element of truth to their revisionist [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3448.26s)]
*  history that makes them the victim. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3452.7200000000003s)]
*  They are friends with Mike Donnellan and like Anita Dunn. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3454.12s)]
*  Their kids go to their same schools. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3457.44s)]
*  They live in the same neighborhoods. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3459.56s)]
*  They intermarry. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3460.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, like half these couples are like one media, one in politics, and then they're [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3461.7599999999998s)]
*  rolling door. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3465.52s)]
*  They constantly switch and they're at obvious firms together. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3466.52s)]
*  Washington is like, you know, Versailles. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3469.16s)]
*  And so it's impossible to be adversarial. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3472.44s)]
*  Man, we had dinner without naming names, but with the journalist last night, you and I [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3475.88s)]
*  who I never met before. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3481.04s)]
*  Nice guy, actually. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3483.84s)]
*  But from DC, grew up two blocks from me. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3485.38s)]
*  Mother went to the same school that I did. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3488.52s)]
*  He went to the same schools as everyone I know. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3490.68s)]
*  I mean, it's like, if you're from there, you are connected to every other person who's [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3492.2799999999997s)]
*  from there. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3497.34s)]
*  Of course. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3498.34s)]
*  It's like to a much greater extent than people understand just physically. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3499.56s)]
*  Yes, it's like the British court, like totally incestuous. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3503.32s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3506.24s)]
*  Well, you know, this is what I think. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3507.2799999999997s)]
*  I think a lot of times, you know, because I've been a very harsh critic of media corporations [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3509.12s)]
*  and the like, people, you know, ask me like, when did this change or whatever? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3514.16s)]
*  And I like there's always been a lot of closeness between the media and it's supposed to heyday [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3516.9199999999996s)]
*  in the fifties with like, with Murrow and Cronkite and all of that. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3523.0s)]
*  But you know, they were you look at Time magazine and the New York Times, they were outposts [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3527.16s)]
*  for US propaganda and foreign policy during the Cold War. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3531.16s)]
*  I think, you know, there was a long time when journalism was considered this like, working [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3534.6s)]
*  class outsider profession and the people who went into it didn't want to be like wearing [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3541.32s)]
*  Armani suits and, you know, going to dinner at the White House and with like, be like [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3546.32s)]
*  celebrities. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3551.32s)]
*  They were just like, you know, working class guys who just wanted to like throw rocks at [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3552.32s)]
*  power. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3556.0s)]
*  That was their personality. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3557.0s)]
*  That's why they went into journalism. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3558.0s)]
*  And of course, going back even further, like the First Amendment says, you know, all American [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3559.4s)]
*  minds enjoy freedom of the press. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3563.84s)]
*  There was no such thing as like this secret priesthood of called journalists like professional [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3565.32s)]
*  and the press was literally the printing press that everybody could use and everybody did [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3569.84s)]
*  use. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3573.6400000000003s)]
*  You'd have to be a journalist to use it. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3574.6400000000003s)]
*  It was just a means of expressing and disrupting and informing and organizing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3575.6400000000003s)]
*  And that's what they protected. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3579.84s)]
*  And as huge corporations started buying media outlets, you know, like Westinghouse buys [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3582.1200000000003s)]
*  CBS and then it's owned by Viacom or Disney now owns ABC, you know, that sort of thing. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3587.84s)]
*  And then the corporatization of mainstream media, if you think about the kind of attributes [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3592.36s)]
*  that are required to succeed in large corporations, it's never being disruptive to anybody who [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3598.6400000000003s)]
*  has authority. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3606.4s)]
*  It's conformity. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3607.7200000000003s)]
*  It's, you know, just sort of being a good soldier for people in power, which is the [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3609.6800000000003s)]
*  opposite attributes that make a good journalist and the incentive schemes that journalists [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3618.7s)]
*  are now encouraged to follow to rise within media are the kind of people who worship power, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3625.06s)]
*  who are obedient to it. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3632.8999999999996s)]
*  And that to me has become the most fundamentally rotted part. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3635.2599999999998s)]
*  And that's why, you know, what inspired me to get into journalism was like the blogosphere [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3637.8199999999997s)]
*  of like the early 2000s, which are like just all these angry people on the right and left, [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3641.3799999999997s)]
*  hating the media, no credentials, but like seeing things that they weren't seeing, you [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3644.8199999999997s)]
*  know, hating the Bush administration, but either from the right or from the left, hating [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3649.14s)]
*  the mainstream media, same thing. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3652.58s)]
*  And like you start realizing like, wow, like this mainstream media and politics is like [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3653.8599999999997s)]
*  a tiny little like Obama once described it as, you know, like, well, like John Boehner [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3658.7s)]
*  is supposed to call me a communist, but you know, everyone knows the reality is we just [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3663.94s)]
*  fight within the 40 yard line. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3667.14s)]
*  It's like we're basically on the same team. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3668.42s)]
*  We just the 40 yard line. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3669.8999999999996s)]
*  And you realize there's this whole other space and way of looking at things. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3671.14s)]
*  And it was really the internet that gave rise to it, which is why the internet is and controlling [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3675.46s)]
*  it and censoring it is the thing that is on the top of their agenda because it's the biggest [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3680.26s)]
*  threat to them. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3683.94s)]
*  So the people trying to wreck our civilization want you to be passive. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3684.94s)]
*  They want you weak so they can control you. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3689.7000000000003s)]
*  Weakness is their goal. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3693.62s)]
*  No thanks. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3695.78s)]
*  Our friends at Beam, a proud American company, understand that our country can only be great [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3697.04s)]
*  if its people are strong. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3702.76s)]
*  And that's why they've created a new creatine product to help listeners like you stay mentally [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3704.4s)]
*  sharp and physically fit. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3708.76s)]
*  People like to mock creatine. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3711.76s)]
*  CNN doesn't like creatine at all. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3713.0s)]
*  People buy it because it works. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3716.08s)]
*  Beam's creatine can help you improve your strength, your brain health, your longevity. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3718.32s)]

*  you eat. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3727.48s)]
*  Of course, you don't hear about it too much because again, a population that is strong, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3728.6000000000004s)]
*  clear minded and physically capable is a threat to tyrants. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3733.6400000000003s)]
*  That's why they want you to play in video games. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3738.88s)]
*  To celebrate American strength, actual American strength, Beam is offering up to 30% off their [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3741.5600000000004s)]

*  We strongly recommend it. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3765.68s)]
*  Why do you see things? [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3767.92s)]
*  Well, I should just say, I think your mom worked at McDonald's actually. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3769.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, which wouldn't be shocking if you were in any other business, but I don't [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3772.68s)]
*  think I know a single other person in our generation in media who can say that. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3778.56s)]
*  Yeah, I think like, I mean, Richard Nixon had this as well. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3785.84s)]
*  I think Trump has it to an extent too, even though Trump grew up very wealthy, but it [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3790.72s)]
*  was like outer borough wealth, which is not looked upon kindly by like old money in Manhattan. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3793.96s)]
*  And then he comes into Manhattan and started building gigantic buildings and being all [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3799.88s)]
*  flashy about it. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3803.04s)]
*  And so he understood that he was looked down upon by those people. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3805.4s)]
*  Same with Richard Nixon. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3808.64s)]
*  Richard Nixon always knew that like the intelligentsia on the East Coast hated him, thought he was [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3809.64s)]
*  disgusting. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3814.56s)]
*  And I think if you grew up feeling excluded from certain kind of power centers, there's [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3816.28s)]
*  always going to be a kind of resentment that you have toward it. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3821.68s)]
*  And I suppose in some way that could lead to like a desperation to be integrated into [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3824.44s)]
*  it. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3828.52s)]
*  I think more often than not, and certainly in my case, it made me want to deconstruct [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3830.08s)]
*  it and show like the facade that they use to glorify themselves, but the dirt and filth [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3835.7599999999998s)]
*  that really lay underneath. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3840.64s)]
*  And I think that kind of distance really helps with clarity of vision. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3843.16s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3847.04s)]
*  And traveling, you were saying last night that you think that traveling is one of the [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3848.8s)]
*  most expanding things you can do. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3853.24s)]
*  I did that interview with Alexander Dugan, I know you've interviewed him too. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3856.52s)]
*  And I know we're all supposed to hate him and he's a fascist, whatever. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3861.6s)]
*  But one of the reasons I really loved him is he's a philosopher. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3865.92s)]
*  When I say I loved him, I mean I love talking to him. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3868.04s)]
*  He's a philosopher. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3871.88s)]
*  Sometimes I studied philosophy in college, it was my obsession, I wanted to teach philosophy, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3874.72s)]
*  I ended up being more practical in law school. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3878.12s)]
*  But thinking about things in terms of their first principles and always needing a rationale [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3881.0800000000004s)]
*  or a logical train that gets you from the start of your question to the end of whatever [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3887.28s)]
*  answer you think you've embraced is very important to me. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3890.7200000000003s)]
*  And just thinking about not being reflexive. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3894.6400000000003s)]
*  So one of the things he said to me was he said, I'm always accused of being a racist [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3897.7400000000002s)]
*  or a white supremacist because I'm so devoted to preserving Russian culture and Russian [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3904.48s)]
*  civilization. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3910.4s)]
*  And he said, actually the biggest racist by far are Western liberals because they believe [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3911.4s)]
*  that their way of being is so superior that every single other culture should give way [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3916.4s)]
*  to adapting itself to their way of life. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3922.52s)]
*  The whole world should be homogenized in their vision because they're inherently superior. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3925.6800000000003s)]
*  They find a tribe, some ancient tribe, and they want to immediately mold it into Washington [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3929.36s)]
*  neoliberals. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3934.96s)]
*  What he was saying was what makes the world valuable and interesting and ultimately the [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3937.8s)]
*  way you advance and think about things is that you have all these different traditions, [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3942.48s)]
*  all these different civilizations like Russian civilization and Chinese civilization and [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3946.2000000000003s)]
*  Muslim civilization and Western civilization and preserving those is what ensures that [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3949.88s)]
*  we have this diversity of thought and everything contributes something. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3957.4s)]
*  So you are constantly told, and maybe this is universal, when you grow up in a society [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3962.96s)]
*  that your way of life is, we're always told the United States is the greatest country [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3968.48s)]
*  ever to exist in the whole history of the world. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3971.8s)]
*  What a great coincidence for me that I was born in the objectively greatest country to [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3974.6800000000003s)]
*  ever be on the planet, not just now but all of human history. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3979.44s)]
*  And there are some parts of the United States that I love and I think are very uniquely [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3982.7200000000003s)]
*  valuable for sure, but the more you get to know other types of ways of thinking, and [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3987.12s)]
*  you have this experience, like if some neighbor has a politics different than yours and you [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3993.72s)]
*  think they're crazy and then you go and talk to them and you understand them better. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=3996.88s)]
*  And then that makes you be more open to ways of looking at things that, that to me is what [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4000.4s)]
*  like intellectual vibrancy is, is going to places that you don't understand, hearing [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4006.56s)]
*  that you were taught to believe are crazy or evil or wrong. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4012.76s)]
*  And then, you know, when you talk to the human beings who believe them, you understand that [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4017.08s)]
*  they actually have as much conviction about it or as much rationale for it as you do for [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4020.36s)]
*  yours. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  I just think that's a beautiful sentiment and thank you for saying it. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4025.6400000000003s)]
*  So what you're really arguing for is diversity. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4028.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, like diversity, like not the kind that, you know, we've been told is diversity where [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4030.84s)]
*  everyone thinks the same thing, but like they have surface level diversity. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4036.2000000000003s)]
*  The Indian guy, the black guy and the white lady all went to Princeton and they're diverse. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4040.4s)]
*  Yeah, I remember this initiative where we wanted to diversify our newsroom at the Intercept [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4043.92s)]
*  and so we hired like a black Harvard student whose parents were partners at Golden Saks [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4047.64s)]
*  and then like a Latino person who went to Yale and their partners were at JP Morgan. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4052.72s)]
*  And then like, you know, and that was like diversity, like everything but like working [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4056.7999999999997s)]
*  class diversity or experiential diversity, you know, the most like superficial kind, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4061.02s)]
*  the most easily accommodated kind. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4066.2799999999997s)]
*  I do know very much. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4068.8399999999997s)]
*  So what did you think, so you interviewed Dugan in Russia, in Moscow. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4070.56s)]
*  What did you think of it? [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4074.6s)]
*  When was the last time you were there? [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4075.6s)]
*  I had been several times because I visited Snowden and you know, in Citizen 4, the one [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4077.7599999999998s)]
*  of the last scene of Citizen 4, the film that was made about the Snowden, our work with [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4083.24s)]
*  Snowden that won the Oscar that Laura Poitras directed was her and myself going to Russia [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4088.68s)]
*  to interview Snowden about like a next sort of story. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4095.92s)]
*  Imagine, pardon to interrupt, imagine a Snowden film winning an Oscar now. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4098.84s)]
*  I mean, at the time it was, we were, when we started winning all the awards and we did [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4104.52s)]
*  the whole like award circuit and we started winning, we were very shocked. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4111.72s)]
*  And at the time, I remember after they announced Citizen 4 as the winner of the Oscars, it [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4116.64s)]
*  was Neil Patrick Harris who was the host of the Oscars. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4123.6s)]
*  We had gone on stage and gotten the award. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4125.76s)]
*  And he then said, Edward Snowden wanted to be here, but he was unable to for some sort [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4128.64s)]
*  of treason. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4134.4400000000005s)]
*  You know, like playing, doing a word play on reason, but like with the word treason. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4136.08s)]
*  And it's like, you fucking idiots, like you're Hollywood. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4139.64s)]
*  You went through like the McCarthy era, you went through all these things that you claim. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4143.76s)]
*  Oh, he was told to say that? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4147.64s)]
*  Yeah, of course, it was part of the script. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4148.96s)]
*  War is a brilliant filmmaker and I think it won because of the quality of the film, like [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4153.64s)]
*  in the drama inherent in the story. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4158.12s)]
*  Not because, because the politics of it were that we were exposing spying programs developed [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4159.8s)]
*  under President Obama largely, almost entirely. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4164.52s)]
*  But as you're so right, this was before Russiagate. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4168.320000000001s)]
*  This was before, you know, where anything connected to Russia was considered like. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4170.4800000000005s)]
*  There's no chance. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4173.92s)]
*  You wouldn't even get it here. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4175.04s)]
*  I don't think it would even, yeah, they wouldn't even consider it at this point. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4176.04s)]
*  So you'd been to Moscow before, but you were just there this winter, this spring? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4179.88s)]
*  Just a few months ago, two, three months ago. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4183.72s)]
*  What did you think? [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4185.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, you know, we talked about this before, but like, I remember the first time [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4186.04s)]
*  I ever went to Russia, I was so shocked by the immense disparity between what I had been [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4190.28s)]
*  taught to think what Russia was like and what I was seeing in front of my own eyes. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4197.04s)]
*  And you know, you can go anywhere and like, you know, people come to Brazil, to Rio de [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4201.2s)]
*  Janeiro, and they only go to the richest neighborhoods. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4205.24s)]
*  And they're like, oh, it's, but you know, there's a whole undergirding of misery and [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4207.28s)]
*  suffering that you don't see because you don't go there. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4210.76s)]
*  So I'm very cognizant of that, right? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4213.36s)]
*  You can't go to a country and spend like two days there and be shown the best parts and [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4215.0s)]
*  then think like, oh, wow. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4218.6s)]
*  Nonetheless, it's not only beautiful, it's extremely well run, it's clean. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4222.12s)]
*  But the thing that, you know, that I felt like was most present was the richness of [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4226.92s)]
*  Russian history and culture and tradition. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4235.04s)]
*  I mean, this is a civilization that has been around for, you know, thousands of years and [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4237.68s)]
*  that has produced the highest in like literature and music and dance and architecture. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4242.52s)]
*  And I mean, it has been through like wars of like, like the most difficult kind. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4248.72s)]
*  And you just feel the heaviness of all of that, like the greatness of it. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4256.04s)]
*  And obviously, I understand that there's political repression there. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4262.36s)]
*  I understand that there's a huge, all kinds of social problems. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4265.639999999999s)]
*  I'm not denying any of that. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4268.92s)]
*  That's true everywhere. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4270.5199999999995s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4271.44s)]
*  Pretty much. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4272.44s)]
*  But you understand why Russians have this immense pride in their country and in their [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4273.36s)]
*  civilization. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4280.679999999999s)]
*  And so it didn't feel like a gas station with nuclear weapons, as McCain said. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4282.48s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4287.4s)]
*  Right. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4288.48s)]
*  Has there ever been an uglier thing that any politician, just a dumber, I mean, McCain [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4289.32s)]
*  was dumb. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4294.32s)]
*  I knew him very well. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4295.32s)]
*  Very, very, very. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4296.32s)]
*  He was low IQ. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4297.32s)]
*  Totally. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4298.32s)]
*  Wasp. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4299.32s)]
*  Hate to say that, but it's true. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4300.32s)]
*  With good qualities. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4301.32s)]
*  He had good qualities. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4302.32s)]
*  But he was an idiot. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4304.28s)]
*  But to say something like that out loud is like there's just, I don't know. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4305.719999999999s)]
*  Like if you're an idiot, keep it to yourself. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4310.679999999999s)]
*  A gas station with nuclear weapons, I just, ugh. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4312.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4315.32s)]
*  I mean, that's what I mean. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4316.32s)]
*  Like you're taught in college even. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4317.32s)]
*  The greatest literature is like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, who are the greatest novelists [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4320.96s)]
*  ever. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4324.5599999999995s)]
*  Which is true. [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4325.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, undoubtedly. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4326.5599999999995s)]
*  And also just the history, the role they played in World War II and the Bolshevik Revolution [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4329.0s)]
*  and the wars of the 17th and 18th centuries. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4336.599999999999s)]
*  Moscow itself and St. Petersburg even more so are so beautiful and striking. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4342.48s)]
*  Overwhelming. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4348.679999999999s)]
*  Like in a way that like the best Western European cities are. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4349.679999999999s)]
*  Like the history of it, the grandness of it. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4353.44s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, you have to go see things for yourself and you start realizing how much [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4359.32s)]
*  your, how much, when I started writing about politics, I'll just tell you this quick story. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4363.24s)]
*  I never intended to be a journalist. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4368.5599999999995s)]
*  I didn't go to school for journalism. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4370.28s)]
*  That was not part of my, my life plan in any way. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4371.28s)]
*  It was just after 9-11, you know, as I saw these radical changes to our civil liberties [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4375.76s)]
*  and the name of fighting terrorism, but also just the climate became so repressive in terms [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4382.28s)]
*  of what you could question, what you could say. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4386.08s)]
*  That's when I started feeling a need to want to say things that I felt like weren't being [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4389.12s)]
*  said. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4392.44s)]
*  And when I started doing that more or less full time, it gave me the luxury of going [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4393.5599999999995s)]
*  and looking at things so that I wasn't being told by the New York Times what a document [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4400.919999999999s)]
*  said. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4405.12s)]
*  I was able to go spend the three hours to read the document. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4406.12s)]
*  And when you go and do that, you have the like luxury of that time, which most people [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4408.5599999999995s)]
*  don't have. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4411.639999999999s)]
*  They're taking care of their kids. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4412.639999999999s)]
*  They're working, et cetera. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4413.639999999999s)]
*  You can't fight propaganda if you don't, you know, have the resources to do it, especially [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4414.639999999999s)]
*  time. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4419.2s)]
*  I started realizing how many things I had believed. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4421.16s)]
*  And I had like a, you know, high opinion of my intellect. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4424.24s)]
*  I thought I was like a high end political consumer. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4427.28s)]
*  You know, I like lived in New York. [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4429.88s)]
*  I like went to good schools. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4431.2s)]
*  In many ways that makes it worse, not better. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4433.5199999999995s)]
*  I've learned that, yes. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4435.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4436.76s)]
*  And so, you know, just going back and I basically decided I had to dismantle almost everything [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4437.76s)]
*  because so much of it was just ingested through no critical faculties. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4443.92s)]
*  Why would you want to dismantle your assumptions? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4448.8s)]
*  I mean, that's such a painful process. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4450.76s)]
*  It sucks. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4453.2s)]
*  But why would you want that? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4454.320000000001s)]
*  Why wouldn't you just say, you know, I believe what I believe and that's it? [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4455.320000000001s)]
*  Like I decided in college. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4458.12s)]
*  You know, this is like right after 9-11 and the war in terror, like the Iraq war, which [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4459.12s)]
*  everybody was kind of like, wait, what just happened? [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4465.64s)]
*  We just went and did this massive land war, this invasion on the other side of the country, [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4468.16s)]
*  a country that had nothing to do with 9-11 because we were told they were somehow responsible [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4472.64s)]
*  based on nuclear weapons and chemical weapons they actually didn't have. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4476.639999999999s)]
*  Like everybody at that point, more or less, was starting to question. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4480.679999999999s)]
*  And you know, you feel angry and betrayed when inside your brain you're led to believe [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4486.599999999999s)]
*  things that are just false. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4490.88s)]
*  Yes. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4493.5199999999995s)]
*  And you want to sponge it from yourself. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4494.88s)]
*  You want to cleanse yourself of that. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4496.92s)]
*  I think that's a virtuous response. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4500.12s)]
*  Well, I think you've done that. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4502.679999999999s)]
*  That has been... [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4504.48s)]
*  It took a little longer, but yeah, and it was... [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4505.879999999999s)]
*  Because you were so much more immersed in it than I was. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4507.839999999999s)]
*  It was a little more painful. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4509.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I was right in the middle of it. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4510.839999999999s)]
*  But a lot of people didn't do it. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4511.839999999999s)]
*  I just want to call to the attention of listeners how rare what you did was. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4514.36s)]
*  And that process of self-examination, which is the root of wisdom, is unusual. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4518.879999999999s)]
*  People just don't want to deal with it. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4524.5199999999995s)]
*  Like Jake Tapper saying, I look upon some of my coverage with humility, like that fake [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4526.0s)]
*  kind of like... [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4531.04s)]
*  Well, there's really nothing more galling than fake humility. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4532.04s)]
*  I mean, that's like meta-fake. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4534.92s)]
*  Scripted, scripted fake humility. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4536.76s)]
*  Because the one thing you hope is real is humility, but it's not. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4538.88s)]
*  So I got to ask you about something. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4544.2s)]
*  So because of AI, I'm a little suspicious of things I see on the internet because could [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4545.88s)]
*  that really be real? [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4551.24s)]
*  So someone sent this to me the other day. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4552.24s)]
*  This is a person who I confirmed is a real person. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4554.08s)]
*  I didn't believe it at first. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4557.4s)]
*  Congressman Randy Fine of Florida. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4559.52s)]
*  He said this the other day on Fox News last week, quote, in World War II, we did not negotiate [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4563.16s)]
*  a surrender with the Nazis. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4568.64s)]
*  We did not negotiate a surrender with the Japanese. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4570.44s)]
*  We nuked the Japanese twice in order to get unconditional surrender. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4572.62s)]
*  That needs to be the same here in Gaza. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4577.44s)]
*  There is something deeply wrong with this culture and it needs to be defeated. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4580.12s)]
*  So we're going to nuke Gaza because of its culture. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4584.44s)]
*  We're going to kill everybody because we don't like the culture, which by the way, lots of [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4587.92s)]
*  Christians in Gaza, Muslims in Gaza. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4591.24s)]
*  Just innocent people in Gaza of all kinds. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4594.04s)]
*  Of course, but to say there's some like Gazan culture that's cohesive, it's like what? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4595.96s)]
*  But we're going to kill them all because we don't like their culture. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4600.88s)]
*  And so I didn't believe that was real. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4606.28s)]
*  I didn't really think he was a member of Congress. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4607.5199999999995s)]
*  I texted a friend. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4609.599999999999s)]
*  He's newly elected. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4610.599999999999s)]
*  Like in the last, he filled Matt Ga- I think it was Mike Walz or Matt Gaige's seat, one [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4611.599999999999s)]
*  or the other. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4615.5199999999995s)]
*  It was Walz. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4616.5199999999995s)]
*  Walz, yeah. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4617.5199999999995s)]
*  So I texted a friend of mine in Congress. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4618.5199999999995s)]
*  Is this really a member of Congress? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4619.5199999999995s)]
*  It's like, I don't even know what to say to that. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4621.92s)]
*  But that first of all, it's evil. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4623.4s)]
*  But how can you say something like that and not get expelled from Congress or the Republican? [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4625.76s)]
*  How can that person be a member of the Republican Party? [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4629.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4631.12s)]
*  So let me say two things about that. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4632.12s)]
*  And yes, Randy Fine is very real. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4634.82s)]
*  I've been watching him for a while now, ever since Trump endorsed him as this America first [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4636.5599999999995s)]
*  candidate. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4640.6s)]
*  He had served in the Florida Senate, in the Florida legislature, maybe the Florida House, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4641.64s)]
*  but one of those two bodies. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4647.44s)]
*  So he was a member of the Florida- hates, DeSantis hates him. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4648.799999999999s)]
*  He hates DeSantis. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4652.839999999999s)]
*  He has a feud with DeSantis. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4653.839999999999s)]
*  And his entire political existence is centered around a foreign country, which is Israel, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4657.919999999999s)]
*  not the United States. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4664.839999999999s)]
*  He barely ever talks about the United States. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4665.839999999999s)]
*  So that's America first? [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4667.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4668.679999999999s)]
*  America first. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4669.679999999999s)]
*  So let me just say two things. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4670.679999999999s)]
*  One is this broader point, and then I want to get to the more important one. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4671.679999999999s)]
*  I started noticing this in like 2006, 2007. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4674.5199999999995s)]
*  And I know you hear this all the time. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4677.16s)]
*  World War II was one of the worst things that has ever happened to humanity. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4681.44s)]
*  And the reason it happened was because you had these massive military powers with these [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4686.96s)]
*  new technologies that had never previously been used in war, engaged in mass destruction, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4693.44s)]
*  and a madman who was leading and had started the war for all kinds of reasons. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4698.36s)]
*  And you had the world's most powerful factions throughout the world destroying each other [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4706.4s)]
*  in the most inhumane way, to the point where we not only used nuclear weapons, but after [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4710.08s)]
*  the war was over, we decided we never wanted to have a war like that again. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4714.24s)]
*  We imposed by convention, we agreed to all sorts of limits through the Geneva Convention [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4719.599999999999s)]
*  and all these other treaties and conventions, ways to make sure that what happened in World [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4724.48s)]
*  War II never happens again. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4729.16s)]
*  The people who got blamed for it, it was a form of victor's justice at Nuremberg, were [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4731.679999999999s)]
*  put to death. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4735.92s)]
*  But at the same time, the Nuremberg trial, the judges and prosecutors said the only way [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4736.92s)]
*  the principles that we're pronouncing here at the Nuremberg trials will have any value [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4742.320000000001s)]
*  as anything other than victor's justice is if the principles we're enunciating apply [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4746.04s)]
*  to all countries in the future, including the part of the countries presiding over the [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4751.08s)]
*  tribunal. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4755.92s)]
*  It was meant to enunciate universal principles that all countries agreed to on earth because [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4756.92s)]
*  it was so inhumane. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4762.56s)]
*  It just stripped everybody of their humanity. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4764.8s)]
*  Every time we have a new war or someone wants to sell a new war in the United States, the [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4769.04s)]
*  only historical framework that they'll use as if they only studied one thing in high [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4774.5199999999995s)]
*  school and college, the only thing they know is World War II. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4779.76s)]
*  They know nothing about World War II by the way. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4783.36s)]
*  All they know is that Churchill is good because he went and fought and Chamberlain is bad [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4786.5199999999995s)]
*  because he tried to use diplomacy. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4792.64s)]
*  I wrote an article about this one like six months after I started writing about politics [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4795.12s)]
*  in 2006, how everything was superimposed on it was the framework of World War II and you [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4798.240000000001s)]
*  are either Churchill or Chamberlain and you choose one or the other and neocons to this [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4805.240000000001s)]
*  very day, by which I mean people who always want the United States to go to war in the [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4809.4800000000005s)]
*  Middle East and elsewhere. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4813.360000000001s)]
*  The minute you say you're not interested in war, you're Chamberlain and the minute that [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4814.76s)]
*  you want to go to war, you're heroic Churchill. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4819.320000000001s)]
*  And so the idea that because we use nuclear weapons against Japan, Imperial Japan, filled [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4822.4s)]
*  with enormous amounts of skill and money and know-how and massive military force allied [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4829.879999999999s)]
*  with Nazi Germany, one of the most industrialized military forces ever, that because we ended [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4835.679999999999s)]
*  the war with nuclear weapons, then we're supposed to now use it on a completely defenseless [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4841.799999999999s)]
*  population of two million people, half of whom are children who have no army of any [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4847.099999999999s)]
*  kind, can't even break out of Gaza, let alone threaten any other country in the world is [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4851.48s)]
*  absolutely demented. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4855.24s)]
*  But that is one of the war propaganda themes that are always used is everything is World [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4856.96s)]
*  War II and that's the only war that we can reference, even though at the time the idea [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4861.599999999999s)]
*  was we have to prevent all this from ever happening again, they want to replicate it [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4867.32s)]
*  eternally. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4871.12s)]
*  But I don't know that I can support a party with someone like Randy Fine in it. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4872.12s)]
*  I don't understand, like how could someone like Randy Fine, I mean that's so disgusting. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4875.679999999999s)]
*  It's demented. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4880.24s)]
*  That is psychotic to say that. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4882.04s)]
*  Does anyone say that about Randy Fine? [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4884.88s)]
*  Well, here's, I think Randy Fine is such an important, despite how repulsive he is, ethically, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4887.92s)]
*  morally and physically, despite that, I think he's a very important instrument for looking [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4896.5599999999995s)]
*  at this radical contradiction within the Republican Party and especially the America First movement. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4901.8s)]
*  So Donald Trump, obviously there were a lot of Republicans who wanted to run for that [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4908.360000000001s)]
*  Mike Walt seat and for the Matt Gaetz seat and whoever Trump endorses is essentially [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4912.54s)]
*  guaranteed the winner. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4916.54s)]
*  And he endorsed Randy Fine and said, Randy Fine is all America first. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4918.46s)]
*  And I remember the day that that happened, thinking Randy Fine actually is not even concerned [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4922.9400000000005s)]
*  about America, let alone placing it first. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4930.1s)]
*  His entire political existence is driven by loyalty to a foreign country. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4932.42s)]
*  Everything for him is Israel, everything. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4938.9800000000005s)]
*  And to like even to an extent that is very severe for a Congress that in general prioritizes [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4941.46s)]
*  Israel to a shocking amount, I can't think of a foreign country that is as important [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4949.1s)]
*  to as Israel is to United States that has any other kind of foreign country placing [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4954.54s)]
*  its interest on par with, if not above it. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4958.780000000001s)]
*  And so here you have a member of the Republican Party who identifies as America first, who [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4961.46s)]
*  Donald Trump endorses a member of America first and whose loyalty is to a foreign country [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4968.82s)]
*  who wants to have the American worker fund that foreign country, wants the American worker [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4972.459999999999s)]
*  to pay for their military, give $4 billion automatically every year in a deal negotiated [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4976.98s)]
*  by Obama and Netanyahu and when Obama was on his way out. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4981.879999999999s)]
*  And every time Israel wants to have a new war, we send them whatever they want, billions [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4985.459999999999s)]
*  more. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4989.099999999999s)]
*  We feed them all these weapons paid for by the American taxpayer. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4990.099999999999s)]
*  We isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4992.7s)]
*  We block every UN resolution that the entire world supports in order to tie ourselves [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=4995.06s)]
*  to Israel. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5000.46s)]
*  We lose our own standing, our own soft power, our own imagery in the world. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5001.46s)]
*  We lose massive amounts of money. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5004.900000000001s)]
*  All sorts of people have said that the reason we have, there's so much anti-American hatred [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5008.3s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5012.780000000001s)]
*  The reason why people want to attack our country, the reason why we can't get things done in [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5013.780000000001s)]
*  the Middle East, a region where we have a lot of interests is because of the hatred [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5018.660000000001s)]
*  for the United States driven primarily by our standing behind and doing everything for [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5022.639999999999s)]
*  Israel. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5027.44s)]
*  Well, some of Bin Laden said that in his manifesto. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5028.44s)]
*  He spelled it out. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5029.5599999999995s)]
*  Can we just talk one second about the fact that Bin Laden wrote a note to the American [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5032.5199999999995s)]
*  people explaining why Al-Qaeda was driven to attack the United States. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5039.2s)]
*  And there were some religious references, obviously, because Al-Qaeda is a nominally [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5046.639999999999s)]
*  religious organization. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5051.28s)]
*  But overwhelmingly, he listed very specific grievances with American foreign policy, all [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5053.44s)]
*  having to do with the fact that we constantly interfere in that region. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5058.12s)]
*  We place military bases on sacred Saudi soil. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5061.32s)]
*  We impose a sanction regime on Iraq for years that killed 500,000 Iraqi children that Madeline [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5066.38s)]
*  Albright said was worth it. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5072.599999999999s)]
*  We overthrow their leaders and impose the ones that we want that then serve the interests [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5075.12s)]
*  of the United States and Israel. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5080.68s)]
*  And we fund and arm Israel to repress and kill Palestinians. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5082.72s)]
*  And he said that it's not that you're some country that's just sitting there peacefully [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5087.320000000001s)]
*  and that never bothers us. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5091.400000000001s)]
*  And we decided, hey, look over there. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5092.68s)]
*  They let their women wear bikinis. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5094.16s)]
*  So we better go and attack them. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5096.280000000001s)]
*  Like we were attacked for our freedom. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5097.92s)]
*  So he writes this letter. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5099.6s)]
*  I remember the letter at the time. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5100.76s)]
*  He was interviewed by Al Jazeera and previously by the New Yorker. [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5102.96s)]
*  So we got to hear from Osama bin Laden. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5112.08s)]
*  Although right after 9-11, the US government told media outlets, do not broadcast any speeches [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5114.4800000000005s)]
*  or interviews with Osama bin Laden. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5121.68s)]
*  And their reasoning was, we're concerned that he may have embedded within his speech some [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5123.94s)]
*  sort of secret code that will activate sleeper cells inside the United States. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5130.04s)]
*  Like he was going to blank Morse code or like have secret phrases. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5134.04s)]
*  And then people inside the United States would hear it. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5138.56s)]
*  So they told ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, do not air any interviews with bin Laden. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5140.04s)]
*  Of course, it was because they didn't want Americans to hear from bin Laden, why there [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5145.36s)]
*  were so much anti-American sentiment. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5150.12s)]
*  It was because of our interference in the Middle East in general and our support for [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5151.68s)]
*  Israel in particular. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5154.32s)]
*  They were selling this lie that it was because we're free and they hate our freedom. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5155.68s)]
*  There are a lot of countries that are free. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5159.44s)]
*  Like Brazil, women walk around in bikinis. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5161.24s)]
*  They have elections. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5163.44s)]
*  Al Qaeda has never attacked Brazil or Japan or South Korea or Norway. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5164.44s)]
*  And bin Laden was explaining why there's so many Muslims in that region who hate the United [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5170.839999999999s)]
*  States. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5174.58s)]
*  But the United States government didn't want anyone to hear it. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5175.58s)]
*  Twenty years later, while October 7th happened and we're supporting this ethnic cleansing, [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5179.4s)]
*  and I would call it now a genocide as well in Gaza. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5186.56s)]
*  That's what most genocidal experts, including Israelis and Jewish ones call it. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5189.6s)]
*  It's hard to say anything else, but whatever. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5194.4400000000005s)]
*  In the middle of all that, a bunch of young people who were told the history of 9-11 that [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5198.04s)]
*  the US government wanted everyone to believe discovered the bin Laden letter because it [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5203.56s)]
*  was on the Guardian's website because the Guardian's a British newspaper. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5208.120000000001s)]
*  It was no American news outlet despite its historical importance. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5211.56s)]
*  And they started passing it around on TikTok and saying, oh wow, I never knew any of this. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5215.74s)]
*  I never understood that one of the reasons why these people attacked us was because we [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5221.34s)]
*  are so monomonitically devoted to Israel and why they were constantly interfering in that [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5227.3s)]
*  region, bombing them, sanctions, overthrowing their government, overthrowing their leaders. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5233.54s)]
*  Of course people are going to get angry at us and want to attack back. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5237.82s)]
*  And the minute that letter started to become well read by the American people who were [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5241.38s)]
*  primarily younger, the US government went ballistic and demanded that TikTok ban it. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5246.74s)]
*  The Guardian, a news outlet, immediately took the letter off their website so nobody could [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5253.82s)]
*  read it any longer. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5258.9400000000005s)]
*  All those links that people were posting on TikTok to go read that letter would no longer [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5259.9400000000005s)]
*  work. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5263.3s)]
*  And then TikTok immediately under pressure from the US government, which was obviously [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5264.42s)]
*  already threatened to close TikTok and ban it from the United States anyway, started [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5267.14s)]
*  banning all the hashtags, Bin Laden letter. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5271.26s)]
*  You could not anymore read or find. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5273.22s)]
*  I mean, this is like the stuff we're taught that the Soviets did, right? [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5274.9800000000005s)]
*  Like hiding letters, hiding documents or erasing history. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5279.46s)]
*  And I continue to be shocked by that event that everybody thought that that was fine. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5284.26s)]
*  To take a letter that is of great historical importance from the person that is alleged [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5290.580000000001s)]
*  to have been responsible for the single worst attack on American soil, maybe on par with [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5298.42s)]
*  Pearl Harbor, but in terms of like a single day casualty count, explaining from his perspective [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5302.9s)]
*  why he did it. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5308.58s)]
*  Like you want to hear from your enemy, right? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5309.58s)]
*  Like you want to understand like what they're claiming. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5310.58s)]
*  I want all relevant information and I'll decide what it means. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5312.02s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5314.62s)]
*  You don't want people deciding for you what you can and can't read. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5315.62s)]
*  They were petrified that young Americans were going to hear the reasons proffered and they [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5318.14s)]
*  made that letter disappear. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5325.38s)]
*  Why would the Guardian, which is supposed to like this left-wing British publication, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5327.34s)]
*  why would they go along with that? [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5331.58s)]
*  The Guardian is very supportive of the Western establishment. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5334.26s)]
*  The UK is aggressively supportive of Israel, always has been, finds it with arms, does [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5340.46s)]
*  a lot of reconnaissance fights over Gaza to feed the Israelis' intelligence. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5345.78s)]
*  And when that kind of pressure comes to bear, TikTok, a gigantic multi-billion dollar corporation, [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5351.46s)]
*  the Guardian, one of the oldest newspapers in the West, they fold in a second. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5357.94s)]
*  Like they're no match for that kind of pressure. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5362.06s)]
*  A pressure that said we want that letter censored so Americans don't know about it, have never [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5365.22s)]
*  read it, don't hear from it, so they only hear from us. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5369.86s)]
*  But so, okay, so that was just a, I'm still amazed every time, every like I didn't mean [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5373.3s)]
*  to go into that because- [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5377.76s)]
*  So why do you love Osama Bin Laden so much? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5378.8s)]
*  I mean, of course that's, and then that, I remember being shocked by it and saying like, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5381.72s)]
*  how can it possibly be the case that we're watching this? [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5385.84s)]
*  And it wasn't, there was no pretext to it. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5390.16s)]
*  It was explicit. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5392.56s)]
*  Like, we can't have people reading this. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5393.56s)]
*  This is terrorist propaganda. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5396.360000000001s)]
*  And then exactly, if you stand up and say, no, I actually, I think people should be able [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5398.76s)]
*  to read that. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5401.56s)]
*  And then they'll say like, oh, you're pro al-Qaeda. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5402.96s)]
*  You want terrorist propaganda to be, to spread? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5406.36s)]
*  And I'm like, no, I just think adults should have all information that they want to have [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5408.96s)]
*  available to them. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5413.36s)]
*  And I don't think the government should be prohibiting certain information from being accessible. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5414.36s)]
*  Also, 3000 Americans were murdered that day. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5419.36s)]
*  And I'm an American. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5423.16s)]
*  I have an absolute right to know all available information about that. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5424.16s)]
*  I don't understand by what, what's the justification for keeping that information for me, an American [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5427.96s)]
*  citizen who faithfully pays his taxes and obeys the laws of the, was born here. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5432.36s)]
*  Like what? [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5435.5599999999995s)]
*  You can't do that. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5436.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, after the 2022 invasion by the Russians into Ukraine, one of the first things the [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5437.5599999999995s)]
*  EU parliament did is made it a crime to platform Russian state media. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5443.36s)]
*  So if you want to say, you know what, I want to hear from Russia. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5449.36s)]
*  I want to understand like what Russia's argument is for doing this. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5451.96s)]
*  You couldn't get it. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5456.16s)]
*  I mean, you could, if you looked hard enough, you could. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5457.16s)]
*  If you went to rumble, you could. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5459.16s)]
*  That's why they're banned in France because they refused to remove RT and Sputnik. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5460.76s)]
*  Think about what that says. [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5465.660000000001s)]
*  Like we want to make sure that we monopolize the flow of information that our citizenry [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5466.660000000001s)]
*  gets and nothing that disputes what we want them to believe can even be heard or available. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5471.64s)]
*  That's why I went to Russia because it drove me, I had no interest really in going to Russia, [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5476.56s)]
*  but it, I'm so grateful that I did, but it drove me so crazy that I wasn't allowed and [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5480.080000000001s)]
*  that Americans were not allowed relevant information about what their government was doing. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5485.320000000001s)]
*  I want to hear from them what their perspective is. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5489.36s)]
*  Maybe I'll walk away and think like, oh, they're murderous, you know, imperialists who just [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5492.16s)]
*  want to consume their neighbor or maybe there's some other way of looking at things that I'm [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5497.66s)]
*  not permitted in the West. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5503.44s)]
*  I want to know what the truth is. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5504.44s)]
*  And that's the whole point of living here is I get to know what the truth is. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5505.759999999999s)]
*  I get to decide for myself what's true. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5508.48s)]
*  And if you take that away, then why? [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5511.08s)]
*  Well, speaking of that, let me just finish this thing about Randy Fine if I could. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5512.639999999999s)]
*  So I, like in 2022 and 2023, there were a bunch of MAGA people who were opposed to [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5517.16s)]
*  the funding of the war in Ukraine and some non-MAGA people too, like RFK Jr. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5525.12s)]
*  And I was obviously very opposed to it from the start. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5532.04s)]
*  You were too. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5534.48s)]
*  I went on to show many times to talk about that. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5535.48s)]
*  And I had a bunch of them on like Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene and RFK Jr., a [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5537.72s)]
*  lot of them. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5542.68s)]
*  And I always had this same plan. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5544.44s)]
*  I would ask them, like, why are you opposed to having the U.S. fund the war in Ukraine? [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5546.96s)]
*  Like, don't you want the U.S. to stand up for Ukraine against Russia? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5550.16s)]
*  And they would all say, this isn't our business. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5553.84s)]
*  This is on the other side of the world. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5557.32s)]
*  It doesn't affect my constituents. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5558.84s)]
*  Our communities are falling apart. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5560.96s)]
*  We have fentanyl addiction sweeping our communities. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5562.76s)]
*  Nobody has jobs. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5565.12s)]
*  Nobody has health care. [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5566.12s)]
*  Our country is falling apart. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5567.12s)]
*  We don't have the money to keep sending to foreign countries. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5568.12s)]
*  And it's outrageous that we keep doing it. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5570.64s)]
*  And they would be very passionate and very adamant. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5572.24s)]
*  I would encourage them to keep developing that idea. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5574.4400000000005s)]
*  And they would. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5576.9s)]
*  And they would say all those things with which I completely agreed. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5577.9s)]
*  And then my next question was always, do you apply the same rationale to the United States [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5580.259999999999s)]
*  funding the Israeli military and Israeli society and Israeli wars? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5584.219999999999s)]
*  And they would all stutter to try and distinguish why it was that they had one view for Ukraine [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5590.299999999999s)]
*  and a very compelling rationale, but then had to say, oh, no, Israel is different. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5597.58s)]
*  To the point that RFK Jr., and I actually really appreciated this about him, when I [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5602.139999999999s)]
*  kept pressing about it, I said, you're saying we don't have money to fund foreign wars, [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5606.12s)]
*  that our country is falling apart. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5609.44s)]
*  Why are we sending billions of dollars to Israel when Israelis have a higher standard [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5610.94s)]
*  of living than millions of American workers, than millions of American citizens? [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5616.5599999999995s)]
*  Why is the American worker forced to subsidize Israel? [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5620.5599999999995s)]
*  You said we can't be doing that. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5623.48s)]
*  We can't afford it when you came to Ukraine. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5624.72s)]
*  Why isn't it come? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5626.4s)]
*  Why isn't the same applicable to Israel? [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5627.4s)]
*  And he then finally said, you know what, I'm going to think about that. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5629.72s)]
*  Maybe it is time for Israel to stand on its own. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5631.92s)]
*  I was like, oh, you think? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5633.76s)]
*  This is the utterly irreconcilable contradiction at the heart of the America First movement, [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5636.400000000001s)]
*  which is America First means we use our resources for ourself. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5641.56s)]
*  We build our military to defend our borders, to defend the American people. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5645.96s)]
*  We use our resources to improve their lives materially, to build better roads and better [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5651.0s)]
*  schools and better communities, to offer them addiction services and whatever else they [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5654.52s)]

*  We do not anymore use it for this globalist agenda of going around the world, giving it [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5661.400000000001s)]
*  to other countries and funding other countries. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5665.74s)]
*  That is the America First philosophy as Trump has articulated it and many people have articulated [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5667.66s)]
*  it for years and the foreign policy of America First as well. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5673.0199999999995s)]
*  Excellent. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5676.62s)]
*  And then on the other hand, those same people, many are adamant that we have to fund Israel. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5677.62s)]
*  We have to fund its military. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5686.78s)]
*  We have to fund its wars. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5688.4s)]
*  We have to subsidize society. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5690.46s)]
*  We have to sacrifice our own interests to protect theirs. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5692.179999999999s)]
*  We have to put the lives of our service members in risk, have American citizens die in order [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5695.14s)]
*  to protect Israel and the wars that it starts with its neighbors. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5701.3s)]
*  And there is no reconciling this. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5705.46s)]
*  There is no way to take an America First ideology and make it consistent with this constant [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5707.5s)]
*  prioritization of Israeli interests, let alone what is now happening, which is the aggressive [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5717.54s)]

*  And I do think there are people now starting finally to understand that these two things [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5734.78s)]
*  cannot be maintained simultaneously. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5740.8s)]
*  It's going to blow up the Trump movement, I think. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5742.9s)]
*  I don't think it needs to. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5745.42s)]
*  I think there's a, you know, you could you could pivot, but I agree just conceptually [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5746.42s)]
*  that those are irreconcilable goals. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5752.9s)]
*  They're so blatantly irreconcilable. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5755.42s)]
*  And of course, the proof in the pudding is going to be what happens with Iran. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5757.62s)]
*  You know, I woke up today, I'm here, and I saw the New York Times and the lead story [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5761.02s)]
*  on the front page of the New York Times is Israel may attack Iran despite Trump's desire [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5766.14s)]
*  to reach a deal. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5772.34s)]
*  And it's like, how can that even be possible? [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5775.02s)]
*  What do you mean Israel might attack Iran despite Trump's desire to reach a deal? [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5776.860000000001s)]
*  Their weapons came from the United States. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5781.1s)]
*  We pay for the operation of those weapons. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5783.900000000001s)]
*  They can't attack Iran without some kind of military and logistical support from the United [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5786.1s)]
*  States. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5791.9800000000005s)]
*  And who is Israel that depends on the United States, that is a vassal state of the United [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5793.740000000001s)]
*  States, supposedly, to say, we don't care what the president of the United States wants [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5798.34s)]
*  in his foreign policy. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5802.46s)]
*  We're going to subvert it and undermine and blow it up and destroy it if we want to. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5803.46s)]
*  That's not the behavior of an ally. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5807.54s)]
*  And I think that, you know, someone who's really tried to avoid this topic and bears [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5809.42s)]
*  no animus toward Israel, actually like a lot of Israelis, talked to me the other day. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5814.14s)]
*  But I think the idea that we're getting a lot out of this or interest of being served [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5820.26s)]
*  is is not is clearly not true. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5825.78s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5827.9s)]
*  Well, you know, there's the Israeli government has had a relationship, a close relationship [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5829.0599999999995s)]
*  with the Chinese communist government for over 40 years. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5834.74s)]
*  And there have been a lot of transfers of military technology from Israel to China, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5838.0599999999995s)]
*  including transfers of American military technology to China. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5842.86s)]
*  It's a fact. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5846.46s)]
*  People lie about it and it is true, actually. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5847.839999999999s)]
*  And I don't think that's widely known. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5851.9s)]
*  I mean, the Chinese help operate the port of Haifa, one of the most beautiful ports in [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5854.099999999999s)]
*  the world. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5857.54s)]
*  Wonderful place. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5858.7s)]
*  But yeah, they're they're in the port of Haifa. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5859.7s)]
*  So how is it that the main recipient of American support, both financial and moral and legal [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5860.98s)]
*  and all the things that we have done for our closest ally, how is it that that country [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5867.5s)]
*  is materially supporting our main global adversary, a country really described by the Trump administration [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5872.74s)]
*  as an enemy? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5880.34s)]
*  That's their posture toward China as an enemy. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5881.34s)]
*  Our military technology is going to Israel and then why not in China? [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5885.099999999999s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5889.66s)]
*  Like how? [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5890.66s)]
*  I don't think again, I don't think most people know that. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5891.66s)]
*  And I don't I don't know even if people in the administration know that. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5893.58s)]
*  I mean, some do. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5896.94s)]
*  How can that? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5898.98s)]
*  What is what's the answer to that? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5899.98s)]
*  Well, well, also, you know, there's this fascinating history, but because it's 30 years ago, a [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5901.82s)]
*  lot of people didn't live through it. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5907.58s)]
*  People forgot about it. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5908.92s)]
*  But the last two presidents that tried to exert independence with respect to Israel [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5910.820000000001s)]
*  and that told Israel you cannot do this if you want to continue to receive our large [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5917.66s)]
*  S were Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5921.06s)]
*  Ronald Reagan called the Israeli bombing of Lebanon a Holocaust and picked up the phone [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5925.58s)]
*  and ordered them to stop. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5932.5s)]
*  And they did and then withdrew the military barriers. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5934.46s)]
*  1982. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5936.700000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5937.700000000001s)]
*  George H.W. Bush. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5938.7s)]
*  And then our Marine barracks were bombed a year later. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5940.26s)]
*  But then he didn't go to war as they were demanding he did with Iran, whoever they he [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5943.26s)]
*  said, why are we even there? [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5947.46s)]
*  But how did our American military, I mean, without getting into this, but like, did anyone [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5949.5s)]
*  know that the bombing was coming? [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5953.92s)]
*  Is it possible that information Intel about that bombing was withheld from the United [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5955.46s)]
*  States? [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5959.3s)]
*  I mean, the Israelis do have a lot of their neighbors under extremely heavy surveillance, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5960.3s)]
*  you imagine they would. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5965.86s)]
*  The other interesting thing was in the George H.W. Bush administration, which was run by [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5967.94s)]
*  these kind of realists like that of the kind that they didn't call it the South of America [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5972.74s)]
*  first. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5977.179999999999s)]
*  But the idea was, you know, we do foreign policy, not for benevolence to other countries. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5978.179999999999s)]
*  We don't rebuild other countries. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5983.74s)]
*  We prioritize American interests. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5985.219999999999s)]
*  People like James Baker and Brent Scowcroft, who were the key foreign policy figures in [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5987.219999999999s)]
*  the Bush 41 administration. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5991.46s)]
*  He was in the CIA, a very similar foreign policy. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5993.0599999999995s)]
*  And their argument was what American presidents have always said, which is that one of the [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=5996.18s)]
*  worst threats to American national interests in the Middle East is the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6000.06s)]
*  conflict and the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank was a direct threat to American [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6005.3s)]
*  interests. [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6011.58s)]
*  And James Baker said, as part of the State Department policy, if you continue to expand [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6012.58s)]
*  West Bank settlements, which prevent an Israeli-Palestinian two state solution that harm our interests, [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6017.52s)]
*  we're going to cease giving you the loan guarantees that you desperately need. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6022.66s)]
*  Why are we going to give you loan guarantees if you're directly harming what we keep telling [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6026.78s)]
*  you are our interests? [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6030.58s)]
*  And what happened was there was this massive smear campaign. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6032.7s)]
*  You can go read it in any newspaper. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6035.98s)]
*  It was led by Bill Clinton, who was preparing to run against George H.W. Bush, calling the [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6037.98s)]
*  Bush administration anti-Semites, suggesting that they were inflaming anti-Semitism by disagreeing [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6042.86s)]
*  with Israel in public. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6049.5599999999995s)]
*  And since then, there has been no president. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6051.18s)]
*  James Baker, I mean, this is like one of the most respected foreign policy operatives in [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6054.26s)]
*  the world. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6061.820000000001s)]
*  And I hated James Baker for a lot of what he believed at the time. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6062.820000000001s)]
*  I would have to probably go back and revise some of that and think about why. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6065.06s)]
*  If only we had that now. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6069.66s)]
*  But there was like zero, zero, zero, zero evidence that he harbored any animosity. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6071.22s)]
*  Well, there's also evidence that there are plans to come in violence against George H.W. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6076.46s)]
*  Bush, the president, actually. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6080.46s)]
*  That's been incredibly alleged. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6082.74s)]
*  So whatever. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6084.54s)]
*  No, of course, you're absolutely what you're saying is absolutely right. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6085.54s)]
*  And no one wants to deal with with being slandered. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6088.34s)]
*  And it is slander. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6092.14s)]
*  It's not true. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6093.14s)]
*  It's unfair. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6094.14s)]
*  It's actually pretty over the top. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6095.14s)]
*  Well, the irony of it, Tucker, is that you're transferring American military technology [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6097.74s)]
*  to China. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6102.42s)]
*  If they're operating, at least in part, the port of Haifa, we're supporting you. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6103.42s)]
*  You have to explain that right away or else we're going to stop all aid, because why would [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6107.98s)]
*  we want to be supporting? [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6111.5199999999995s)]
*  Why would we want to be helping the transfer of American military technology to China? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6112.5199999999995s)]
*  What the hell is going on? [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6117.0199999999995s)]
*  So what's the what is the answer to why the Trump administration, given their views of [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6118.58s)]
*  China, doesn't? [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6123.54s)]
*  I think that the first step. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6124.54s)]
*  Well, I'll just say my position is probably different from yours. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6128.58s)]
*  But like, I'm not against Israel. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6131.339999999999s)]
*  Like Israel, like going there like the Israelis, nice people. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6133.139999999999s)]
*  I'm not, you know, don't seek any kind of argument. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6135.94s)]
*  I'm not anti Israel. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6138.7s)]
*  But I think what America lacks, desperately lacks, and it's gotten to a point where it's [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6140.94s)]
*  dangerous for the country is like an honest conversation about any of this stuff. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6145.42s)]
*  And that's because certain ruthless actors, when it's coordinated online, like attack [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6149.62s)]
*  everyone is like a, you know, call them really hurtful names that affect your personal relationships [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6155.139999999999s)]
*  when you raise these questions. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6162.54s)]
*  But like someone needs to be brave enough to just say, let's have a rational conversation [[01:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6164.22s)]
*  about our national interest. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6166.5s)]
*  I don't think it's harder than that. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6167.62s)]
*  But you know what the irony of it, the core irony of it is the conservative critique or [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6168.82s)]
*  grievance about the American left over the past 20 years has been the minute you try [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6174.38s)]
*  and have an honest conversation about any kind of policy, you instantly get smeared [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6180.4s)]
*  as a racist, a misogynist, because of identity politics, because of identity politics. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6184.34s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6189.78s)]
*  I'm not going to be suggesting that something like that's going on here. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6191.0199999999995s)]
*  Oh, it might be a little bit similar that the minute you like, suggest a question or [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6193.0199999999995s)]
*  even a peep of criticism about Israel, you instantly are branded an anti-Semite. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6198.58s)]
*  It seems pretty similar to me to the tactics long used by the American left that the conservatives [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6202.139999999999s)]
*  have been vocally complaining about for a long time. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6206.9s)]
*  You know, Glenn, I would love to shout you down and say that's unfair, but it's not. [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6210.42s)]
*  That is fair. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6214.219999999999s)]
*  It's true. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6215.219999999999s)]
*  What you're saying is true. [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6216.219999999999s)]
*  And it's I agree. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6217.219999999999s)]
*  And it's, you know, shameful. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6218.219999999999s)]
*  But, you know, the choice is not between like being a Nazi or being Randy Fine. [[01:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6220.46s)]
*  There is a reasonable, sensible, rational course forward where our country, like every [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6229.46s)]
*  other country, makes its foreign policy decisions on the basis of what's best for its own citizens. [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6236.86s)]
*  Like, like you can say, I don't think it serves our interest to keep the war in Ukraine going [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6242.26s)]
*  and paying for it without being a Kremlin agent. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6246.5599999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6248.9s)]
*  Or saying, I don't know, you know, how is it good that American military technology [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6249.9s)]
*  winds up in China or Pakistani fighters that they receive from China through Israel? [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6254.5s)]
*  Like if that's true, and I think I think there's a lot of evidence that it is true. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6261.86s)]
*  Like how is that a good arrangement? [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6266.7s)]
*  And why is our greatest ally doing that to us? [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6268.299999999999s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6270.74s)]
*  I'm like really confused. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6271.74s)]
*  Like, why don't you answer the question? [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6272.74s)]
*  And it's not enough to call me names. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6273.74s)]
*  You should have to have an honest conversation about this. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6275.94s)]
*  And I do think when that begins, like healing begins, things get better when people can [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6278.74s)]
*  be honest, I think. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6282.86s)]
*  I mean, but there's so many mechanisms. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6285.46s)]
*  Like we just, I just, I'm still, I know I've talked about it so many times, but my mind [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6287.54s)]
*  always gets so blown when we talk about it again. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6291.16s)]
*  Talking about honesty and discourse, they banned the Bin Laden letter. [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6294.0599999999995s)]
*  There's so many mechanisms designed to prevent any honest conversation from being held about [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6297.9s)]
*  policies that people in power want to keep immune from questioning or challenge. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6304.58s)]
*  Like hey, why are we still in NATO? [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6310.62s)]
*  That's to me the thing that turned, that turned people against Trump, turned people in the [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6312.42s)]
*  establishment against Trump. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6316.38s)]
*  I think we already talked about that, but like that's not supposed to be a questionable [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6317.82s)]
*  topic. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6322.5s)]
*  Like why are we still in NATO? [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6323.5s)]
*  And like, oh, it's a defensive alliance, except like we bombed Serbia and like Yugoslavia [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6325.0199999999995s)]
*  with it, even though they weren't actually posing a threat to Western Europe and had [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6334.54s)]
*  nothing to do with the Soviet Union or like it went to war in Libya to remove Muammar [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6337.9s)]
*  Gaddafi because he wanted to start using Libyan oil more for like the benefit of the Libyan [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6342.22s)]
*  people. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6347.22s)]
*  Okay, Glenn, if I could just say it's a defensive alliance. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6348.22s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6349.82s)]
*  It was, those were preemptive words. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6350.82s)]
*  It's a defensive alliance. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6351.82s)]
*  It's a defensive alliance. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6352.82s)]
*  Not to be defensive. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6353.82s)]
*  No, it's, yeah. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6354.82s)]
*  No, I, look, so there are all those mechanisms, including like calling people racist for a [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6355.82s)]
*  long time who wanted to raise issues about whatever. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6361.5s)]
*  Well, sure. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6364.5s)]
*  I mean, I remember this in 1991 when I got into this business doing a story on Head Start. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6365.5s)]
*  I've never been against Head Start as an idea. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6370.5s)]
*  The original idea was like, we're going to literally raise children's IQs through better [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6373.18s)]
*  nutrition and early childhood education. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6378.94s)]
*  That is not a crazy idea. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6381.68s)]
*  It didn't strike me as crazy at the time. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6382.68s)]
*  And you start asking questions and well, does it work? [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6384.84s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6387.06s)]
*  It's supposed to help these kids. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6388.06s)]
*  Is it helping them? [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6389.06s)]
*  Shut up, racist. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6390.06s)]
*  I was so confused and I realized no one even remembers what Head Start is, but it was a [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6391.660000000001s)]
*  very promising program in the minds of many that didn't work. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6396.34s)]
*  But the point of calling you names was to continue doing things the way they'd always [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6400.02s)]
*  been done because some people are benefiting from that. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6404.4400000000005s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6406.580000000001s)]
*  It had nothing to do with race. [[01:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6407.580000000001s)]
*  Just as I don't think this argument has anything to necessarily to do with ethnicity or religion. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6408.740000000001s)]
*  It's just like, what's best for America? [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6415.34s)]
*  The protest movements on college campuses were, I don't want to say led by because that's [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6416.62s)]
*  maybe an exaggeration, but in many cases is definitely true, but driven in large part [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6421.14s)]
*  by Jewish students vehemently opposed to the destruction of Gaza by Israel. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6426.74s)]
*  So the idea that somehow it's anti-Semitic to question either the Israeli destruction [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6432.1s)]
*  of Gaza or the US financing of it when you have huge numbers of Jews on the streets every [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6438.26s)]
*  day marching in protest against it by itself should reveal how corrupted that tactic is. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6443.62s)]
*  And yet it's so effective because it's instantaneous. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6449.379999999999s)]
*  No one wants to be called a racist. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6453.9s)]
*  No one wants to be called an anti-Semite. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6455.379999999999s)]
*  And it is an effective tactic, at least it makes it so that you think maybe it's just [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6458.5s)]
*  easier for me to keep my mouth shut about this and talk about something else. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6462.78s)]
*  I've always felt that way. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6465.179999999999s)]
*  It's way easier. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6466.419999999999s)]
*  I don't want to get involved in it. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6467.419999999999s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6468.419999999999s)]
*  I've got all kinds of concerns about my country, which really is kind of falling apart in key [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6469.94s)]
*  and measurable ways. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6474.82s)]
*  People are dying younger. [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6476.38s)]
*  I feel like that's something we should think a lot about and try and fix and everything. [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6477.5s)]
*  It's like, I don't want to get involved. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6480.82s)]
*  And I do grieve when I see our public conversation hijacked by what I consider foreign concerns, [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6482.82s)]
*  like both sides. [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6488.98s)]
*  Like, you know, you shut down Midtown Manhattan because of some conflict thousands of miles [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6489.98s)]
*  away. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6494.74s)]
*  It's like we... [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6495.74s)]
*  Except it's an American war though. [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6496.74s)]
*  Well, that is it. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6497.74s)]
*  But it's not just Israel. [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6499.82s)]
*  I mean, you see it all the time. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6500.82s)]
*  You see people getting murdered in like the upper Midwest because of like there's a Sikh, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6502.1s)]
*  Hindu, you know, whatever, all that stuff. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6507.58s)]
*  I just feel... [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6510.38s)]
*  I do feel like this country needs a lot of care and attention and it's been neglected. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6511.38s)]
*  And that's how I feel. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6516.1s)]
*  So I... [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6517.1s)]
*  Or maybe that's how I justify staying out of it. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6518.1s)]
*  I don't want to be involved in it. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6519.62s)]
*  But you have kind of been a little bit more involved than you used to be. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6521.02s)]
*  And I think... [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6523.38s)]
*  But also because... [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6524.38s)]
*  Well, it's going to destroy the MAGA movement, which I think is really important. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6525.38s)]
*  It's in a sense, not just about Trump. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6528.74s)]
*  Of course, I love Trump. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6530.5s)]
*  I've said that many times. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6531.5s)]
*  I have displayed it. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6532.74s)]
*  I campaigned for Trump and I'm glad that I did. [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6534.179999999999s)]
*  But I feel like if there's one thing that could destroy this essential reform movement, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6537.74s)]
*  it's like kind of our last chance to make government responsive to the people who own [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6542.98s)]
*  the government, which is the citizenry. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6547.42s)]
*  This will destroy it. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6550.3s)]
*  Because the massive contradiction sitting at the heart of it. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6551.5s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6553.5s)]
*  It's not all the stuff we talked about, but also free speech, free expression, not being [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6555.06s)]
*  punished for your views was also a vital part of this movement. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6559.38s)]
*  I know that's why I found so much common ground with the American right and with the MAGA [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6562.74s)]
*  movement over the last 10 years, because of my vehement opposition to attempts to censor [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6566.66s)]
*  the internet or introduce laws to characterize certain views as hate speech and therefore [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6571.28s)]
*  punishable. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6575.7s)]
*  And that's exactly what has been done and is still being done. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6576.9s)]
*  Well, I couldn't even believe it. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6579.5s)]
*  When I always liked DeSantis, I spent a lot of time in Florida. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6580.62s)]
*  I was there for part of the pandemic. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6583.98s)]
*  And I liked DeSantis. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6587.339999999999s)]
*  He's smart, you know, he's not a warm guy or anything, but I don't, you know, I'm not [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6588.339999999999s)]
*  looking for new friends. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6592.139999999999s)]
*  I like respect DeSantis and he's very on it on the details. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6593.139999999999s)]
*  Then he signs a hate speech law, travels to a foreign country to sign a hate speech law [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6596.74s)]
*  in Florida. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6601.7s)]
*  And I was so confused. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6603.379999999999s)]
*  I didn't even think this was real. [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6604.379999999999s)]
*  And I said to somebody, well, that was a hate speech. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6605.74s)]
*  It's not a hate speech law. [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6608.379999999999s)]
*  Looks like a hate speech law. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6610.339999999999s)]
*  It looks like Sharia law, kind of a version of Sharia law in Florida. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6611.54s)]
*  Shut up. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6614.74s)]
*  And no one said anything about it. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6616.46s)]
*  And then like all the DeSantis people start attacking me for noting that I've never talked [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6618.02s)]
*  to DeSantis again on the basis of that. [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6621.78s)]
*  Like I don't, what is that? [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6624.66s)]
*  How can you do that in the United States? [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6625.94s)]
*  I mean, there's this attempt now to impose on colleges, require colleges to adopt, but [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6627.3s)]
*  also enact into American law this radical expansion of what anti-Semitism means. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6632.9s)]
*  There's laws that say, here's what racism is. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6637.42s)]
*  Here's what xenophobia is. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6639.54s)]
*  Here's what Islamophobia is, misogyny, whatever, to expand the definition of anti-Semitism [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6641.74s)]
*  to include statements not only about Jewish people who should be subjected to critique. [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6647.34s)]
*  You should be able to say, huh, that Ben Shapiro seems to care quite a lot about Israel, maybe [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6652.7s)]
*  even to the point that he cares about it more than the United States. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6657.06s)]
*  You should be able to express that critique. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6660.06s)]
*  So this expanded definition prohibits not only statements like that, accusing any Jewish [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6662.46s)]
*  person of having greater oil. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6667.74s)]
*  I can say, oh, that person's Irish. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6669.74s)]
*  He seems to really care a lot about Ireland more than the United States. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6672.02s)]
*  Or that person is Indian. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6675.94s)]
*  He really seems to care a lot about India, maybe even more so. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6677.7s)]
*  You're allowed to say all that. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6681.1s)]
*  Or in my case, Swedish. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6682.1s)]
*  I've been accused of dual loyalty many times. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6683.42s)]
*  Oh, your obsession with Sweden is so annoying and very disturbing. [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6685.18s)]
*  But the other thing is you cannot say, this is just one example. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6689.82s)]
*  You cannot say Israel is a racist endeavor. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6693.62s)]
*  You can say Iran is a racist endeavor. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6697.219999999999s)]
*  You can say Hamas is a racist endeavor. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6699.84s)]
*  You can say the United States is a racist endeavor. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6701.38s)]
*  You can say anything you, you can be a student at a school a month away from completing your [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6704.38s)]
*  PhD with a completely clean record. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6710.0599999999995s)]
*  And you can write a not bad saying, I think America is a country of violence and imperialism [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6712.9s)]
*  and evil and was founded on racism. [[01:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6718.98s)]
*  And you'll be totally fine. [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6721.299999999999s)]
*  You write an op-ed, one tenth of those criticisms, but about Israel and ICE is coming to get [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6722.7s)]
*  you and to deport you. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6728.78s)]
*  Why is that? [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6730.5s)]
*  Why is not just our free speech being limited, but being limited not even to protect our [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6731.5s)]
*  own society and our own government, but to protect a foreign government from critique? [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6736.12s)]
*  So this is the kind of thing that cannot be sustained by a movement that has certain values [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6741.5s)]
*  that have professors that are being radically assaulted by this one single policy and loyalty [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6746.0599999999995s)]
*  toward this other country. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6751.74s)]
*  I could not agree more. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6752.74s)]
*  I mean, it's in the matter. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6753.74s)]
*  And I do think, and I know people who love Israel and believe in the project and it's [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6755.54s)]
*  fine. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6761.5s)]
*  I have a million friends who believe that and that I'm not mad at them about it, but [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6762.5s)]
*  you could believe that and say America's founding documents, its bill of rights is sacrosanct [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6767.099999999999s)]
*  and under no circumstances should American citizens be stripped of their rights. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6774.3s)]
*  Any circumstances, period. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6778.900000000001s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether it's in the service of a foreign nation or any service of anything. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6780.18s)]
*  Like that's the whole point of America. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6784.660000000001s)]
*  Like you could have that position, couldn't you? [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6786.42s)]
*  I mean, the whole MAGA movement is about preserving American identity and American values. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6789.06s)]
*  So what does that mean? [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6795.3s)]
*  It certainly has to include America's founding documents and the values that it embodies. [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6796.3s)]
*  I don't know what else it would include. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6801.660000000001s)]
*  I don't know what else there is. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6802.660000000001s)]
*  I cannot simultaneously say that you want to be a movement that is devoted to preserving [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6803.66s)]
*  American identity and American values while at the same time permitting attacks on the [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6808.7s)]
*  core rights and the core founding ideals on which the entire country was founded. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6814.78s)]
*  Right. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6819.66s)]
*  No, I couldn't agree more. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6820.66s)]
*  For all my really sustained efforts to just stay away from stuff, I don't want to deal [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6822.78s)]
*  with it. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6827.3s)]
*  It upsets people. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6828.3s)]
*  It's like not my greatest interest in life. [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6829.3s)]
*  It's not even on the top 10. [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6830.98s)]
*  And I shouldn't have to care this much about a foreign country. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6833.4s)]
*  That's kind of like my internal monologue on this question. [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6835.639999999999s)]
*  I feel like it's being pushed to the point where it's in this whole species of new stories, [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6839.0199999999995s)]
*  ideas, developments is a threat to our Bill of Rights. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6846.5199999999995s)]
*  And that has to be the point where you're like, no, stop. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6852.599999999999s)]
*  Right? [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6855.879999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, I was said before that you go to other countries and you see all these [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6856.879999999999s)]
*  values of other countries that you're told have none. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6862.68s)]
*  But I also said like there are certain things about the United States that I consider uniquely [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6865.280000000001s)]
*  valuable and one of them is, you know, the stuff that I went and studied in law school, [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6869.16s)]
*  which I became incredibly enamored of and still am, which are like the Federalist Papers [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6872.96s)]
*  and debates over like how to form this new government to prevent it from replicating [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6876.900000000001s)]
*  the tyrannies of other governments, including the empire that they had just risked all of [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6881.38s)]
*  their lives to wage war from and gain independence from and created these documents that to this [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6885.12s)]
*  very day continue to be our guiding principles. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6890.64s)]
*  And the idea that we're going to permit the erosion of those for any reason is offensive [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6894.320000000001s)]
*  to me. [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6899.780000000001s)]
*  But to do so in defense of a foreign country on the other side of the world because they [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6900.780000000001s)]
*  have so much influence in our politics, that is, I mean, that is just so offensive to me. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6904.96s)]
*  I don't care what impact it has on my career. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6910.56s)]
*  I don't care what people say about me. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6912.120000000001s)]
*  Like that is something I will never stop talking about. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6913.400000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6915.76s)]
*  And I think it's not it's not sustainable because as you said, it's the contradiction [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6916.76s)]
*  is just too it's just too obvious. [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6919.64s)]
*  And the last thing I'll say is not that it's like a top concern of mine or whatever, but [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6921.400000000001s)]
*  I don't think it's great for Israel, actually, at all. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6926.320000000001s)]
*  Like long term, this is not the way to play. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6929.08s)]
*  Well, an Israeli politician, actually a general just said Israel is on the way to becoming [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6930.64s)]
*  a pariah state. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6934.76s)]
*  Yeah, that's not I don't know how that helps. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6935.76s)]
*  And you can't transfer American military technology to China. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6938.280000000001s)]
*  I just want to say that for the fifth time, because I don't think most people know that [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6941.76s)]
*  that's happening. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6945.0s)]
*  But it is. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6946.08s)]
*  I want to ask you one last question. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6947.12s)]
*  Um, we have this like long and deep conversation off camera about what makes people happy. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6948.92s)]
*  And there does seem to be quite a part from politics or global affairs, like an epidemic [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6957.08s)]
*  of unhappiness, at least in the world that I live in, in the West, in the West, not thank [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6964.44s)]
*  God in my family, but everywhere else, people are really unhappy. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6970.0s)]
*  It's measurable suicide rates, all that stuff. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6972.68s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6975.36s)]
*  What is that? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6976.36s)]
*  Well, first of all, there's a documentary that is on Netflix that I watched many years [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6977.36s)]
*  ago called happiness. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6983.44s)]
*  And it measures the rate of happiness in various places around the world. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6986.28s)]
*  And it turns out that in some of the poorest countries in the world, the levels of happiness [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6990.0s)]
*  are at its highest and some of the richest countries of the world, the rate of happiness [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6993.839999999999s)]
*  is at its lowest. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=6997.04s)]
*  And in many of those poorest countries, they live in villages where they have their children [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7000.24s)]
*  around them all the time. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7006.04s)]
*  They have extreme connectivity and connection to other human beings who live in their community. [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7007.679999999999s)]
*  They live in a communitarian way. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7014.08s)]
*  So they are constantly receiving one of the things, I might even say the greatest thing [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7016.36s)]
*  that constitutes human happiness, which is connection to other human beings. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7023.879999999999s)]
*  We are political and social animals. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7027.84s)]
*  We can't survive isolated. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7029.56s)]
*  You look at any people who have been put in sustained isolation and they will say that [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7031.74s)]
*  there's nothing worse than that. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7036.4800000000005s)]
*  John McCain talked about that all the time, that he was physically savage, but that that [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7037.88s)]
*  was nowhere near as horrifying and terrorizing as the sustained isolation that he was kept [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7041.2s)]
*  in where you have no human beings around to connect to or talk to or interact with. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7047.56s)]
*  We need that so fundamentally. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7051.56s)]
*  When you look at how the West is now constructed, where people leave their house early in the [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7053.84s)]
*  morning, both parts of a couple that children don't run off to, so everybody's running [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7059.52s)]
*  off in different directions. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7065.4400000000005s)]
*  When our parents get sick, we put them at homes. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7068.32s)]
*  When they get old, we put them at homes. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7072.68s)]
*  We don't stay together as families anymore. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7074.0s)]
*  And then when we work, we all go scatter far away and we spend all day in cubicles. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7076.52s)]
*  The worst part is the internet encourages us to stay at home. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7081.96s)]
*  People got trained during COVID, especially how to live completely isolated from the rest [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7085.34s)]
*  of the world and from everybody else. [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7089.68s)]
*  They were forced into it. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7091.0s)]
*  If you deprive human beings of connection, then you can have all the money in the world, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7093.64s)]
*  all the fame in the world, whatever you think is the thing that will make you happy and [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7098.88s)]
*  you will never find happiness. [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7102.28s)]
*  I think we both know Johan Nahari, who's a friend of ours, who wrote this incredibly, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7104.24s)]
*  I think, revolutionary book about how to understand addiction. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7110.04s)]
*  Yes, and depression and sadness in general, emptiness. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7113.04s)]
*  Right. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7116.24s)]
*  He then wrote another book about just like the depression epidemic, especially among [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7117.24s)]
*  younger people in the West. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7121.68s)]
*  That first book about addiction, the thesis of it was that people think the opposite of [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7123.32s)]
*  addiction is sobriety, when in reality, the opposite of addiction is connection. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7130.44s)]
*  By that, what he means is that all of these things are spiritual diseases, depression [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7137.0s)]
*  and addiction and anxiety and all these disorders that people suffer from that are new. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7141.96s)]
*  You talk to anyone in Gen Z, I have colleagues in Gen Z, my kids are getting to that age. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7148.16s)]
*  They're 16 and 17, I see their age group. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7152.679999999999s)]
*  There's so much mental disorder. [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7155.48s)]
*  It's because society is not giving human beings what they want, which is connection. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7158.74s)]
*  You can go talk to medical doctors about addiction and they will all tell you the same thing, [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7164.76s)]
*  which is like there is no cure for addiction, chemically, medically. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7170.2s)]
*  The only cure for addiction is going to places like an AA or whatever because there you find [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7174.04s)]
*  this instant and immediate connection with any kind of human being based on shared experiences. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7179.68s)]
*  That's the only thing that cures that disease because it's a disease of the spirit, of the [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7186.76s)]
*  soul. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7192.0s)]
*  It is not a biological disease where chemical medications will cure it. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7193.0s)]
*  I think that the ability to be open to human connection, to have it readily available is [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7198.24s)]
*  probably the foundation of human happiness and the deprivation of it is what will eliminate [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7204.8s)]
*  human happiness. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7209.44s)]
*  All of modern society is about keeping people stratified and isolated and away from each [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7210.44s)]
*  other. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7214.64s)]
*  I think there's surveys that say people who are in their 20s will say on average they have [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7217.24s)]
*  one friend at most or like two friends at most that they rarely see. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7222.8s)]
*  People live away from their family. [[02:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7227.4800000000005s)]
*  Everything is about depriving people of connection. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7229.0s)]
*  Not saying that was the intent or the plan, but that's the outcome and there's no way [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7232.76s)]
*  to have human happiness without connection. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7237.56s)]
*  I know that in my life the place where I've seen it most clearly is in AA. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7241.24s)]
*  I haven't, so over many years I haven't been to AA a ton, but the first time I ever went [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7245.88s)]
*  I was so struck by how what I was seeing was kind of what people have talked about but [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7251.28s)]
*  sort of presented an ersatz replica of like true connection between people from totally [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7257.64s)]
*  different backgrounds, cultures, races. [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7265.24s)]
*  It was the diversity we're always promised, but like we're so cynical about, I am so cynical [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7269.28s)]
*  about this whole bullshit. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7273.12s)]
*  You go to an AA meeting and because it begins with basically ritual humiliation, well I'm [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7274.92s)]
*  Tucker, I'm an alcoholic, it's like ugh, say that out loud, it hurts, even if it's [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7282.2s)]
*  true, which in my case it is. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7286.36s)]
*  And like the first admission is like I am powerless. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7287.36s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7289.64s)]
*  To confess your impotence. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7291.76s)]
*  But you have to confess it and once that strips away all the pretense and then you experience [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7293.08s)]
*  people on a level that church promises, but I personally have never experienced in church, [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7302.02s)]
*  I want to, but where it's just like you are dealing with people on the most human level. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7306.740000000001s)]
*  Like all that matters is the other person's soul or something. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7315.580000000001s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7319.14s)]
*  I have a profound experience. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7320.14s)]
*  You know, it's into like the new pope and like this is the part of Catholicism that [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7321.14s)]
*  I really admire so much, like the ethos of the gospels. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7325.18s)]
*  Jesus always wanted to minister to the lepers and the prostitutes and the outcasts, even [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7328.94s)]
*  though there was no necessarily like common bond between them other than their humanity, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7334.86s)]
*  which is what the gospels teach you to basically think about the world as being about, as human [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7339.62s)]
*  connection, as the ability to look at the lowest people and see their soul, see that [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7348.099999999999s)]
*  they're all equal before God, all of this. [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7355.219999999999s)]
*  One of the things diversity does, like diversity in this like modern corporatized HR sense [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7358.46s)]
*  is it pretends to do that, but it actually is constantly reminding you of these differences [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7363.3s)]
*  and forcing you to think about them like, oh, I have three black coworkers that I'm [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7367.860000000001s)]
*  supposed to get along with and I have like two gay ones over here and like it is constantly [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7371.740000000001s)]
*  stratifying people across the lines, like categorizing them and counting them based [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7376.26s)]
*  on their differences. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7380.3s)]
*  And so there's any kind of like similarity or connection is forced. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7382.34s)]
*  It's like very self-conscious. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7385.9400000000005s)]
*  Nothing causes more division than that. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7387.98s)]
*  Right. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7390.0599999999995s)]
*  You strip everybody down to like no ego and have everybody converge based on their greatest [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7391.0599999999995s)]
*  weakness and suffering and difficulty. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7400.139999999999s)]
*  And you don't even have to give the slightest thought to, oh, this person is different and [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7402.78s)]
*  yet I'm able to have communion with them. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7407.9s)]
*  That's so genuine. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7409.7s)]
*  It just happens automatically. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7410.7s)]
*  Like it, all those things fade away. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7411.86s)]
*  Like people can walk into an NA meeting and just feel like they're living in a different [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7415.18s)]
*  world and thinking about other people and feeling other people in a way. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7418.66s)]
*  And then they walk out and the whole world then reappears that constantly teaches us [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7421.780000000001s)]
*  to keep everybody at arm's length. [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7425.740000000001s)]
*  But you walk into those kinds of meetings. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7428.8s)]
*  The idea of it is like you strip down to your deepest core like foundation of your humanity [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7430.3s)]
*  and then on that level, everyone is the same. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7436.58s)]
*  The connection that emerges from that is why it works, why people go their whole lives [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7440.740000000001s)]
*  to it. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7444.86s)]
*  You know, even if they haven't had a drink or a drug for 25 years, they still need it. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7445.86s)]
*  Well, that's why I went. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7450.259999999999s)]
*  I have no interest in drinking. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7451.9s)]
*  I went because a loved one, someone I love, needed to go. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7453.0599999999995s)]
*  So I brought that person and I was like, I want to go every day. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7457.66s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that in my life. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7461.98s)]
*  It makes you see the potential for what the world could be. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7464.259999999999s)]
*  That's what everyone wants is the connection. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7466.62s)]
*  Right. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7468.339999999999s)]
*  Because other people are all that matters. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7469.339999999999s)]
*  Just to reiterate, other people are all that matters. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7470.339999999999s)]
*  That's so easy to lose that thread. [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7473.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's like our humanity. [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7475.34s)]
*  That's like the soul. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7477.42s)]
*  That's like the spirit. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7478.62s)]
*  It's everything. [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7480.38s)]
*  And that is what Western society is assaulting and depriving people of. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7481.38s)]
*  And so it's no wonder we have epidemics of addiction and suicide, anxiety disorders and [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7487.14s)]
*  depression. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7492.46s)]
*  And distraction. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7493.46s)]
*  It's so easy to see why. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7494.46s)]
*  You should write on this. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7497.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7499.38s)]
*  I mean, I've thought a lot about it. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7500.38s)]
*  I think a lot about it. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7501.38s)]
*  And at some point, maybe I will. [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7503.22s)]
*  I hope you will. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7505.22s)]
*  You describe it much better than I do. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7506.78s)]
*  I'm still trying to sort it out in my head. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7508.1s)]
*  I really was listening a year ago. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7509.62s)]
*  I saw this. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7510.74s)]
*  I was like, I've not stopped thinking about it. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7511.74s)]
*  Yeah, we talked about it last night. [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7513.1s)]
*  And so then I thought about it last night this morning. [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7514.58s)]
*  So it's fresh in my mind as well, like in terms of what it means and how to think about [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7516.82s)]
*  it. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7520.7s)]
*  But yeah, it's something that is, I think, it's kind of like sitting there right in [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7521.7s)]
*  plain sight. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7524.62s)]
*  It's a solution to a lot of things. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7525.82s)]
*  And I think that for a lot of reasons, you need a lot of vulnerability and humility to [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7529.259999999999s)]
*  strip yourself down that way, to admit your powerlessness. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7532.5s)]
*  We're constantly taught to affirm our invulnerability. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7535.139999999999s)]
*  Like I'm strong, I'm powerful, I can deal with anything. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7538.86s)]
*  But human beings are by themselves not all that powerful. [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7542.38s)]
*  There's a lot of things we can do. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7547.62s)]
*  There's a lot of things we can't. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7549.099999999999s)]
*  And the whole point of these kind of addiction groups or whatever, there's a lot of these [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7551.66s)]
*  different kind of groups. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7555.08s)]
*  I think all communities are like them, is like together, like human beings connecting [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7556.08s)]
*  to each other creates a much bigger power than every human being sitting kind of isolated [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7560.84s)]
*  and alone. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7565.44s)]
*  Yes. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7566.44s)]
*  I mean, I believe in a religion that extols humility, in which humility is like the cover [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7567.44s)]
*  charge. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7573.4s)]
*  Like you don't get anywhere without humility. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7574.4s)]
*  That teaches that God submitted to being tortured to death. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7576.96s)]
*  And you get on your knees in a church. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7580.68s)]
*  100% as you should. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7582.08s)]
*  You like bow on the ground. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7583.08s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7584.8s)]
*  All an expression of that same. [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7585.8s)]
*  I remember after 9-11 when I was like, you know, all about attacking Islam, I knew nothing [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7587.4800000000005s)]
*  about Islam. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7591.64s)]
*  I'm not Muslim, by the way. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7592.64s)]
*  I don't work for Qatar. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7594.08s)]
*  Contrary to what a lot of people think, despite the paychecks from Qatar. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7595.08s)]
*  Not a secret shit. [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7597.96s)]
*  But I remember hearing someone on, I worked at CNN at the time and like we had all these [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7599.84s)]
*  endless experts, most of whom kind of worked for the CIA, but whatever. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7604.320000000001s)]
*  I realized that later. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7607.72s)]
*  But I remember who it was, come on and be like, you know, Islam is bad. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7608.72s)]
*  And I was like, sounds bad, you know, whatever. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7611.88s)]
*  I don't know if I ever met a Muslim, but he's like, you know what Islam means? [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7614.0s)]
*  Submission. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7618.92s)]
*  And like let it hang in the air. [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7619.92s)]
*  Like that was self-evidently disgusting. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7621.72s)]
*  And I was like, I think submission to God is like the whole point of life. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7623.32s)]
*  But I didn't say anything. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7626.84s)]
*  I was like, I don't think I'm against that. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7628.08s)]
*  Anyone who submits to God, like I'm just for that. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7633.0s)]
*  Well, and the, I mean, I think a lot of religions seek the same things, just find different [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7637.24s)]
*  ways to think about how to find them. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7641.68s)]
*  But the whole point of AA and NA, like the foundation of it is that you submit to a higher [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7645.240000000001s)]
*  power. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7651.240000000001s)]
*  It can be, you know, understanding that there's a lot of people who are now atheist or secular. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7652.240000000001s)]
*  It doesn't necessarily have to be some like religious conception of a God. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7655.84s)]
*  And so many people go into these groups and they're adamantly contemptuous of this idea. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7659.280000000001s)]
*  Like, this is so irrational. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7664.64s)]
*  I'm not going to pretend that there's some magic thing. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7666.240000000001s)]
*  And you know, I used to think that way too. [[02:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7669.08s)]
*  And then I got to the point where I was like, no, you know what actually is irrational? [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7671.4400000000005s)]
*  Thinking that there's no higher power than you. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7675.08s)]
*  Like I am the highest power. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7677.6s)]
*  Like that's the absurd thing. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7679.96s)]
*  But it's all about losing that sense that you're invulnerable and understanding that [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7682.0s)]
*  you can find something higher than yourself. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7690.16s)]
*  And it could just be the connection of the human group, whatever you want it to be. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7691.8s)]
*  Whatever you recognize as being able to do things that you can't do is already an acknowledgement [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7695.68s)]
*  that there's a higher power than you. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7701.6s)]
*  But if you think you're God, you're not allowed. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7703.72s)]
*  I mean, if you think you're God, you're going to have a lot of difficulties in life. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7706.6s)]
*  You're going to be Toria Nuland. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7710.400000000001s)]
*  So it's not good. [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7711.400000000001s)]
*  Glenn Greenwell, thank you. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7712.400000000001s)]
*  Really, always my favorite person to talk to. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7714.400000000001s)]
*  So I appreciate your coming. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7717.04s)]
*  Thank you Tucker. [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7718.04s)]
*  I always enjoyed it as well. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7719.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7720.04s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7721.04s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7727.08s)]
*  That's what they do. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7728.76s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7729.76s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7731.16s)]
*  our economy and our politics, with the wars, on the cusp of fighting right now, Google [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7734.56s)]
*  has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7739.84s)]
*  That is totally wrong. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7744.16s)]
*  It's immoral. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7746.12s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7747.48s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7748.76s)]
*  It's a waste of time. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7750.4s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7751.4s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7752.4s)]
*  true, not intentionally deceptive. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7756.16s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7758.879999999999s)]
*  Subscribe. [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7762.799999999999s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7763.799999999999s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7767.92s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_ndIxdM1BA&t=7773.0s)]
