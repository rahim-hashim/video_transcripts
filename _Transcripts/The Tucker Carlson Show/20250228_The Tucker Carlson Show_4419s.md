# Dr. Richard Bosshardt: Surgeons No Longer Need to Be Good, They Just Can’t Be White
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0)
*  So let me ask you, you, 2022 became famous for a day or two because you got into it with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=0.0s)]
*  the American College of Surgeons? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=8.68s)]
*  I'm still into it with them, yes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=10.64s)]
*  You're still into it with them? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=12.6s)]
*  It's approaching its third year. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  It's third year. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=15.8s)]
*  Can you just give us a quick reminder of what that contra-tum was about, what happened? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=16.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=22.72s)]
*  I am a surgeon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=24.0s)]
*  I'm a plastic surgeon, but I was a general surgeon for a while. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=26.04s)]
*  One of the things that I did after I became a surgeon was to apply for fellowship in the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=30.48s)]
*  American College of Surgeons, which is an honorary sort of a thing to have attached [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=36.32s)]
*  to yourself. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=42.16s)]
*  If you become a fellow, you're allowed to put the letters F-A-C-S after your name. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=43.760000000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=47.96s)]
*  And something I sought to do. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=48.96s)]
*  So I became a fellow on the ACS, American College of Surgeons, and went along for 30-plus [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=50.36s)]
*  years as a practicing surgeon doing my thing. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=55.68s)]
*  And then what happened was in and around 2018, 2019, you could say I woke up. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=61.2s)]
*  I realized that there was something going on in my area of surgery. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=68.64s)]
*  And it began with a transcript of a lecture by an invited lecturer to the American College [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=80.36s)]
*  of Surgeons Clinical Congress that they have every year. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=101.76s)]
*  The lecture was titled, A Pathway to Diversity, Inclusion, and Excellence. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=104.8s)]
*  That was the title of the lecture. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=110.8s)]
*  And for reasons that I can't explain, I read it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't normally have done that, but I read the entire transcript. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=115.96s)]
*  I read twice, and not once with excellence mentioned in there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  And so I wrote a commentary that was actually published in the Bulletin of the ACS where [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=123.08s)]
*  concerns about taking down excellence as the primary directive for surgery for surgeons [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=129.88s)]
*  and replacing it with diversity, inclusion, and at that time, the equity, they didn't [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=139.35999999999999s)]
*  throw that in there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=142.84s)]
*  And that commentary didn't really do much. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=145.24s)]
*  So fast forward a couple of years, and you have COVID, which, you know, its own thing, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=148.44s)]
*  and then you have the George Floyd killing. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=154.2s)]
*  I think you could realistically say that the country went crazy after George Floyd. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=158.44000000000003s)]
*  I mean, everything from riots and whatnot to this mass movement to adopt the idea that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=162.0s)]
*  the country was systemically racist, and every institution, every organization was racist, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  and we had to radically transform the country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=176.56s)]
*  And the American College of Surgeons was no different. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=179.72000000000003s)]
*  They jumped right on that bandwagon. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=181.8s)]
*  Within weeks after the George Floyd killing, I mean, literally weeks, they had assembled [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=184.28s)]
*  a task force on racism, and they published this in the Bulletin, which is their quarterly [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=189.68s)]
*  newsletter. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=194.44s)]
*  And the Bulletin basically said that they were doing this to deal with racism in the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=196.16s)]
*  ACS. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=202.08s)]
*  It wasn't like, is there racism in the ACS? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=203.08s)]
*  There is racism, and we need to figure that out. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=206.48s)]
*  Like refusing to operate on black people? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=210.32s)]
*  Not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=213.24s)]
*  That would be pretty extreme. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=214.24s)]
*  No, I'm joking. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=215.72s)]
*  I mean, like, where was the racism in surgery? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=217.8s)]
*  It's almost as bad, Tucker. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=221.08s)]
*  The idea is that, well, let me take that step. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=223.6s)]
*  They claim that surgeons were racist, that the ACS itself was racist, and that the practice [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=227.94s)]
*  of surgery was racist. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=233.44s)]
*  And the reason why they made that last claim was because there are known disparities. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=235.68s)]
*  We know that the outcomes for surgery are not as good statistically for, we'll just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=240.64s)]
*  call it black and white because it just makes it easier to deal with that, that is not as [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=246.16s)]
*  good for blacks as it is for whites. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=250.4s)]
*  And so the idea is that there is some element of racism or discrimination that impacts the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  outcome of surgery. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=258.14s)]
*  And of course, if you take that to the next step, it means that, you know, blacks are [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=259.14s)]
*  not getting as good care. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=263.92s)]
*  Their surgery is not being done as well and whatever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=265.92s)]
*  There's a whole lot of reasons why you can have disparate outcomes. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=269.16s)]
*  That this was the one reason that they latched onto and they have never let go. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  And then, have you heard of the term racial concordance? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=280.04s)]
*  Okay, that's a really important concept. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=281.04s)]
*  And this is something that's being promoted by the ACS. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=284.16s)]
*  The ACS has explicitly stated that blacks would do better if their surgeon is black. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  Simple as that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=295.68s)]
*  It's a racial concordance that you are going to receive better care by a doctor, surgeon [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=297.4s)]
*  or other doctor. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  If they are of your same race, ethnicity, gender, that you might get better care, pardon [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=304.35999999999996s)]
*  me, better care if you're a woman by a female surgeon, for example. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=309.32s)]
*  And they've hung onto that as well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=314.84s)]
*  So that was the idea behind segregation in the South, of course. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  Well that's the whole thing. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=320.32s)]
*  They're trying to redo that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=321.32s)]
*  They're trying to reinstall segregation into surgery, which when you think about it is [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=323.4s)]
*  a pretty despicable thing to do. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=328.2s)]
*  So I get a white male surgeon is what you're saying? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=329.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=331.36s)]
*  Well, you might need to get a white male surgeon of whatever your ethnic heritage is. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=332.36s)]
*  You might do better with... [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=335.28s)]
*  Kind of happy with the Swedish surgeon, that's fine. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=336.44s)]
*  I'm going to win in this, yeah. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=339.44s)]
*  I need a Brazilian one because my mother is Brazilian. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=340.76s)]
*  Meaning German, by the way. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=344.96s)]
*  Well, I'm half German, half Brazilian. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=345.96s)]
*  There you go. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=347.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=348.76s)]
*  So what happened was this. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=349.76s)]
*  The task force came out with the recommendations at the end of 2020. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=351.88000000000005s)]
*  And the recommendations were, oh my gosh, I mean it's just all litany. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=358.12s)]
*  It was basically a playbook for how to instill DEI. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=361.6s)]
*  They still weren't really calling it DEI that often. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  They were calling it anti-racism still. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=368.68s)]
*  And that term kind of fell out of favor. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=371.24s)]
*  And then DEI became the nice, the more acceptable term for adopting critical theory, critical [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=373.12s)]
*  race theory into surgery. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=379.44000000000005s)]
*  The recommendations were to add anti-racism, Abram Kendi's anti-racism into the ACS as [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=381.79999999999995s)]
*  the value of the ACS. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=387.32s)]
*  They opened up a branded department of diversity, which had not existed before. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  And this is what they call a regental department, meaning that the head of that department, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=394.0s)]
*  the clinical director, was now one of the members of the Board of Regents. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=398.11999999999995s)]
*  Had its own clinical director, its own executive director. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=401.79999999999995s)]
*  They installed all these initiatives. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=405.91999999999996s)]
*  They started training their staff and even the leadership on things like microaggressions, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=408.52s)]
*  implicit bias, ally and active bystander, white privilege. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=414.64s)]
*  And when I saw this, this is one that I guess it really hit me. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=421.64s)]
*  I never thought I would be doing this at this point in my career. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  I'm retired. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=432.2s)]
*  I'm three months retired from 38 years as a surgeon. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=433.2s)]
*  To be an activist was never on my radar. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=437.44s)]
*  But I couldn't let this stand. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  It just really bothered me. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  May I ask you to just go back to the core assumptions that drive this? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=442.56s)]
*  Are they rooted in science? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  Is there? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=449.24s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=450.24s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=451.24s)]
*  So is there any research at all that shows that the outcomes in surgery are better when [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=452.24s)]
*  the surgeon is matched racially with the patient? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=459.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=464.24s)]
*  Duna Harm, the organization that I joined as a result of this whole issue, has actually [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=465.76s)]
*  published. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=472.04s)]
*  You can go online and you can read it. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=473.04s)]
*  They've done a systematic study. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=475.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, actually they've looked at five systematic studies of this issue. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=477.56s)]
*  Does racial concordance, does concordance of ethnicity and race and so forth correlate [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=483.12s)]
*  to better outcomes in surgery? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=490.8s)]
*  Short answer is no. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=492.8s)]
*  There's no scientific evidence that having a surgeon of your own race will provide better outcomes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=494.32s)]
*  Has there ever been evidence? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=500.67999999999995s)]
*  No. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=501.96s)]
*  So, I mean, just to ask a dumb question. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=502.96s)]
*  Well, let me qualify that. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=505.28s)]
*  There was a study put out that's been repeatedly referred to. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=507.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, even today it's been completely discredited. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=511.4s)]
*  But a study showed that the survival rates for black babies is better if they have a [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=514.9599999999999s)]
*  black doctor, whether obstetrician or whatever, than if it's not. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=521.52s)]
*  And so they keep repeatedly referring to the study. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=527.64s)]
*  But if you look at the study, the study design is terribly flawed. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=531.16s)]
*  The reviewer, if you're familiar with Vinay Prasad, who is a data geek and very good at [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=534.88s)]
*  parsing clinical studies and so forth, came out to this study as catastrophically flawed. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=542.24s)]
*  And even though this study does not by any stretch show that this is the case, it's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=548.8s)]
*  still referred to as the primary evidence for this idea that racial concordance is a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=553.4s)]
*  real thing. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  And it's still in the ACS. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=561.8s)]
*  Were there any push to make certain that white patients got white doctors? [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=564.24s)]
*  When you say a push, but push by whom? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=573.66s)]
*  I'm just being perverse. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=575.28s)]
*  Do they really believe it when they said this? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=578.16s)]
*  They didn't really believe it. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=581.0s)]
*  This is just a way to lower the standards to change the racial composition of surgeons, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=582.0s)]
*  right? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=586.0s)]
*  I think the only thing that's pushing this is ideology. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=587.0s)]
*  I think if you're really science-based, if you follow the science as the saying goes, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=589.84s)]
*  if you look at that, you can't possibly believe that. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=595.8s)]
*  So either you have an ideology that supersedes factual science or you're clueless and you're [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=598.48s)]
*  following whoever it is that's taking the lead on this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=606.28s)]
*  And who was taking the lead in the American College of Surgeons? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=610.92s)]
*  I think it was a very, I can't give you names. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  I could probably name a few people that I know that were instrumental in pushing against [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=617.0s)]
*  me, pushing back. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=620.8399999999999s)]
*  But I think it's a very small vocal group of very, very committed anti-racist or DEI [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=623.24s)]
*  zealots. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=633.4s)]
*  And I think the others have gone wrong. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=634.8s)]
*  I think some members of the ACS have really not researched this to the extent they understand [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=636.9599999999999s)]
*  it and they kind of go wrong because it sounds, you know, DEI, diversity, equity, inclusion, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=644.56s)]
*  sounds wonderful. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=648.72s)]
*  Who would not be for those things? [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=649.72s)]
*  Are those the rules in surgery? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=650.72s)]
*  Like if the other kids are for it, you just do it? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=652.1999999999999s)]
*  You'd think not. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=655.64s)]
*  You would think not, yes. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  That's the thing that was so disconcerting to me. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=660.12s)]
*  Let me carry the story just a step further down the road. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=664.0s)]
*  I wrote to the president of the ACS and I expressed my concerns. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=667.96s)]
*  And I'm a writer, right? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=672.08s)]
*  This is what I don't, talking is not my thing, but I love to write. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=673.44s)]
*  And I wrote a three page single space letter in which I outlined my concerns. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=676.96s)]
*  Never got a response from that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=681.6s)]
*  And so the next thing I did was I actually posted the ACS of the website, of course, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=683.6s)]
*  and they have a thing called the communities, which is a forum for surgeons to communicate [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=688.8s)]
*  with one another. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=692.56s)]
*  If you have a question, you can pose it and surgeons will weigh in and provide advice [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=693.56s)]
*  or answers. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=697.92s)]
*  If you have something you want topic you want to discuss, do the same thing. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=698.92s)]
*  So the largest forum is the general surgery forum. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=701.8399999999999s)]
*  And so I posted on that forum basically that I was concerned about this rush to embrace [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=705.4s)]
*  anti-racism, DEI and the ACS. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=710.2399999999999s)]
*  And if this continued, I didn't see how I could maintain my fellowship. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=712.3599999999999s)]
*  I would drop my membership in the ACS, which is something I never imagined I would do because [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=715.76s)]
*  I've been a proud member of the ACS for over 30 years and I'm not here to bash the ACS. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=720.0s)]
*  I want to be very clear about that. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm still I'm still FACS. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=726.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm still a fellow. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=728.1999999999999s)]
*  They consider me a fellow even though I'm permanently banned, which is kind of an interesting [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  situation to be in. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=733.4s)]
*  And so I posted this this thing saying that I would lead the ACS if this continued and [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=734.4s)]
*  that generated a common thread. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=740.4s)]
*  And if you're familiar with common threads, if you look at the engagement in the common [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=742.16s)]
*  thread, usually it's only about one to 10 percent of people that are reading the common [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=746.32s)]
*  thread that actually engage because that's just the nature of things. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=750.72s)]
*  That common thread ran for four months and 75 individual surgeons and over a thousand [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=756.0400000000001s)]
*  comments. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=762.5200000000001s)]
*  It broke the system basically. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=763.5200000000001s)]
*  I mean, they had to open up a second common thread because they'd never had this much [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=765.6s)]
*  engagement on anything. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=768.7600000000001s)]
*  the surgeons that engaged, waiting in favor of my position as opposed to the ACS. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=772.16s)]
*  And I keep saying, why are we doing this? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=778.04s)]
*  Tell me where the racism is. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=780.36s)]
*  Let's deal with the racism, but don't just call us racists and go with that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=781.8s)]
*  And they repeatedly refused to do that. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=787.48s)]
*  Who is they? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=789.9599999999999s)]
*  This is the leadership of the ACS. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=790.9599999999999s)]
*  This is my beef is not with the ACS with my fellow surgeons. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=793.48s)]
*  My beef is with the leadership of the ACS. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=796.92s)]
*  It might be interesting just to hear if you can recall some of the names of the leadership [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=798.52s)]
*  who did that just for the record. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=802.0s)]
*  I don't have any problem because it's public record. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=803.36s)]
*  The general secretary with the fellow named Tyler Hughes just retired. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=805.72s)]
*  Tyler Hughes. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=809.28s)]
*  Yeah, general surgeon. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=810.28s)]
*  And he was the editor in chief of the communities. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=811.28s)]
*  So he was kind of moderating. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=814.1999999999999s)]
*  And he would weigh in sometimes if it seemed like surgeons were getting a little bit too [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  heated and so forth. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=819.84s)]
*  And my position was, you know, we're professionals. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=821.48s)]
*  You know, surgeons are opinionated. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  We're not shrinking violets. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  We state our case. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  We're certainly qualified to have conversations without a chaperone. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=830.88s)]
*  And I didn't really like the whole chaperoning thing that was going on. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=834.0999999999999s)]
*  And so this went forward. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=837.9s)]
*  And as common threads do, it kind of ran its life expectancy really beyond what you'd think [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=839.76s)]
*  for months. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=845.88s)]
*  At which point I was thinking, okay, so I did that. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=846.88s)]
*  What do I do now? [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=849.52s)]
*  And I was waiting to see what my next step would be. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=850.52s)]
*  And the ACS leadership, the Board of Regents, reached out to me. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=853.56s)]
*  Tyler Hughes reached out to me and said, we'd like to have you on a Zoom call. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=856.8399999999999s)]
*  This was going to happen in 2022. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=863.28s)]
*  They wanted to wait a little bit. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=866.28s)]
*  They wasn't until March because they were bringing on board their new director of diversity, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=868.04s)]
*  a doctor named Bonnie Mason, who is their clinical director of diversity. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=873.0s)]
*  And so the Zoom call consisted of myself and Tyler Hughes and Bonnie Mason and a regent [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=877.04s)]
*  of the ACS, a member of the Board of Regents named Tim Eberlein, who is a very well-known, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=883.16s)]
*  prominent surgeon in a big institution. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=887.24s)]
*  And I had joined a group called FAIR, F-A-I-R, the Foundation Against Intolerance and Racism. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=891.9599999999999s)]
*  And I helped found FAIR in medicine, which has been working kind of like doing no harm [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  in the area of DEI medicine. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=903.52s)]
*  And so I went to some of my colleagues in FAIR and said, hey, listen, I'm invited to [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=905.68s)]
*  this Zoom call. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=908.74s)]
*  How do you think I should prepare for this? [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=910.52s)]
*  And the first thing they said is, don't go by yourself because you're going to get jumped [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=913.1999999999999s)]
*  on. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=917.0s)]
*  I said, OK. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=918.0s)]
*  That sounds like a reasonable piece of advice. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=919.0s)]
*  So I invited a colleague of mine who's a surgeon I worked with for 30 years. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=921.24s)]
*  Her name is Celia Nelson. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  Celia is a Jamaican-born black female general surgeon, which is an unusual. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=926.28s)]
*  She's definitely in the minority in the ACS. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=932.24s)]
*  And she came on the call. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=935.0799999999999s)]
*  So it was five of us on the call. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  Very, very civil conversation, well over an hour. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=938.36s)]
*  We each stated our positions. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=941.08s)]
*  I stated my concerns. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=942.2800000000001s)]
*  She expressed the same concerns that I did from her standpoint as a woman, a black woman [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=943.7s)]
*  surgeon. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=947.72s)]
*  And I left so encouraged from that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=949.9000000000001s)]
*  I said, wow, this is great. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=951.5600000000001s)]
*  We got a dialogue. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  And this is what I wanted, a dialogue. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=953.5600000000001s)]
*  And I sent an email to everyone that was on the Zoom call and said, thank you so much. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=955.76s)]
*  I hope this will be the start of a conversation where we can discuss these things. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=959.84s)]
*  And a few weeks later, I couldn't get on the communities anymore. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=964.6400000000001s)]
*  I tried to get on the website and get on the communities, and I couldn't get on. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=967.48s)]
*  And I thought, OK, this is some glitch here. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=970.52s)]
*  I think maybe the site had a problem. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=972.48s)]
*  I waited, and I waited pretty close to a couple of weeks before I finally said I contacted [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=974.92s)]
*  Tyler Hughes and said, Tyler, what's going on? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=979.52s)]
*  I can't get on the communities. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=982.64s)]
*  And this is one that was told, oh, by the way, you are permanently banned from access [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=984.92s)]
*  to the communities. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=990.36s)]
*  And in addition, you're banned from access to the member's directory of the ACS. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=992.4s)]
*  And you're banned from your own private voicemail box. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=996.96s)]
*  So it was a total, total isolation. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1000.36s)]
*  And I said, why? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1002.9200000000001s)]
*  Why am I being banned? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1005.2800000000001s)]
*  And the answer was because of your continuous, and I'm basically quoting, your continuous [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1007.4000000000001s)]
*  use of disrespectful language and persistent posting of non-clinical material on clinical [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1012.08s)]
*  forums. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1018.76s)]
*  So the thing was I was being disrespectful, which I have disputed. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1019.76s)]
*  And I can prove I wasn't. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1023.52s)]
*  My non-clinical material was posting this issue of DEI on the clinical forums. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1025.76s)]
*  They brought up in the first place. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1031.24s)]
*  That they, well, and what's interesting is this. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1033.0800000000002s)]
*  They're the ones saying that clinical outcomes in surgery are being impacted adversely from [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1035.0800000000002s)]
*  minorities. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1039.8400000000001s)]
*  But I mean, you were a, I mean, you spent over 30 years just being a surgeon, cutting [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1040.8400000000001s)]
*  and healing people. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1045.74s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1046.74s)]
*  You're not the one who brought this topic into the ACS in the first place. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1047.74s)]
*  They did. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1050.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  But because you discussed a topic that they introduced, they said you weren't a serious [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1052.9199999999998s)]
*  doctor and needed to be banned. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1058.9599999999998s)]
*  I was disruptive and I was being disrespectful. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1060.56s)]
*  And so I did ask, I said, can you please show me a single example of anything that I have [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1062.6799999999998s)]
*  said at any time that justifies this ban? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1067.4399999999998s)]
*  And they have never done that. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1071.72s)]
*  They've, I've asked several times, they've refused every single time. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1072.72s)]
*  So I appealed, I went to the board of regents and appealed. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1076.4399999999998s)]
*  And I said, you know, you know, this is wrong. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1079.04s)]
*  And they came back and said that we review this and we uphold the ban. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1082.6s)]
*  And this is, this is interesting. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1086.3999999999999s)]
*  They said, and we feel that you have received due process. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1088.32s)]
*  Well, due process means that they're saying it went through the proper channels in the [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1091.9199999999998s)]
*  ACS. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1096.52s)]
*  Well, the channels are, there's a fixed process for disciplining a surgeon. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1097.52s)]
*  You have to be informed that you're being investigated for some issue. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1103.08s)]
*  That has to go to their central judiciary committee, which is empowered to investigate [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1108.2s)]
*  their members. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1113.64s)]
*  They decide if there's merit to this, you know, allegation. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1115.3200000000002s)]
*  And if there is, they send it back to the board of regents. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1118.64s)]
*  So then has to, you know, does the punishment, whatever that may be, could be expelled, could [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1122.3600000000001s)]
*  be whatever. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1127.6000000000001s)]
*  They never did that. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1128.6000000000001s)]
*  It never went to the judiciary committee. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1131.44s)]
*  They never informed me that I was being investigated for a possible lifetime ban. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1133.88s)]
*  As a member of the ACS, I am entitled. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1138.88s)]
*  My privileges include the right to having a hearing. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1141.76s)]
*  If I'm looking at being disciplined by my organization, I have a right to have a hearing [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1145.0s)]
*  to defend myself. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1149.24s)]
*  And they denied me that hearing. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1150.24s)]
*  And the reason it's like a catch-22, it didn't go through the central judiciary committee. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1152.0800000000002s)]
*  Therefore I don't deserve a hearing. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1158.0800000000002s)]
*  The gaslighting is unbelievable, Tucker, just unbelievable. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1162.24s)]
*  So I exhausted every avenue I had to address this with the ACS internally. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1165.52s)]
*  And that's when I went public. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1170.8s)]
*  And that's when I wrote my article to the Wall Street Journal. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1171.8s)]
*  And that's when you invited me onto your show very kindly. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1174.44s)]
*  Not all sleep aids are made by pharmaceutical companies. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1177.56s)]

*  And the professional athletes and lots of other smart people do too. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1190.64s)]
*  You add the pod to your mattress, like a mattress cover, and it helps you get a better night's [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1194.2s)]

*  And temperature makes all the difference. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1213.26s)]
*  It's backed by over 600 million hours of data. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1215.04s)]
*  They've also used those insights to create their new product, Sleep Elixir, to help you [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1218.56s)]

*  it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1241.36s)]
*  It works. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1242.36s)]
*  I wanted to hear more about it, not simply because you're the victim of grotesque injustice [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1243.36s)]
*  and authoritarianism, but because the consequences of this kind of thinking are so dangerous [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1248.26s)]
*  to the public health that I think people need to know. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1255.3s)]
*  Because everything you're saying suggests that they're going to radically lower the [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1259.98s)]
*  standard for surgeons. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1263.3799999999999s)]
*  Not that they are, they have. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1265.42s)]
*  They have. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1267.54s)]
*  That's... [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1268.86s)]

*  How can you do that? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1272.34s)]
*  How can you lower the standard for surgeons or air traffic controllers or anyone who's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1273.38s)]
*  got a job with the public health in his hands, you know, a critical job, the critical jobs [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1278.3000000000002s)]

*  I think the way you do it is you do it really slowly over a long period of time and no one [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1288.2600000000002s)]

*  Well, until... [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1295.66s)]
*  Yeah, that's an interesting thing you say that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1296.66s)]
*  You work with a knife in your hand. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1298.3000000000002s)]
*  This is like the highest level of trust. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1300.54s)]

*  Who would you say that to? [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1305.62s)]
*  Only a surgeon. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1306.86s)]
*  And so the consequences are just... [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1307.86s)]
*  If there was ever a field, you know, people talk about airline pilots, sure. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1311.1399999999999s)]
*  If there was ever a field where excellence is a sine qua non of the field, it has to [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1315.62s)]
*  be medicine. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1320.06s)]

*  Exactly. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1323.5s)]
*  Because, you know, when you're the guy with a knife in your hand, first off, you know, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1324.5s)]

*  I said, what's the most important thing you look for in a surgeon? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1340.88s)]
*  And you said excellence. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1343.96s)]
*  Yes. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1344.96s)]
*  Which was exactly right. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1345.96s)]
*  But I wasn't looking for excellence. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1346.96s)]
*  I was looking for trust. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1347.96s)]
*  You have to trust... [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1349.84s)]
*  Well, one flows from the other. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1350.84s)]
*  You have to trust your surgeon. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1351.84s)]
*  And if you are wondering if you're going to get the best care because your surgeon looks [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1353.2s)]
*  different than you do, right off the bat, you're starting handicapped. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1356.32s)]
*  I mean, you're really, you know, hurting yourself and the patient if you can't get that trust [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1359.64s)]
*  pretty quickly. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1366.28s)]
*  Because when you walk into the ER, you don't have a lot of time to connect. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1367.28s)]
*  You can't be doing those nice social things. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1370.48s)]
*  So my band remains in place. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1375.44s)]
*  I'm still banned. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1377.0s)]
*  The ACS will not engage with me. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1378.0s)]
*  They have not engaged with you in three years. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1380.0s)]
*  Oh, no, not at all. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1381.88s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1382.88s)]
*  They refuse. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1383.88s)]
*  I've written multiple letters. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1385.2s)]
*  I wrote letters to the last two presidents. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1387.92s)]
*  I never get an answer back. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1390.8400000000001s)]
*  I wrote letters... [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1394.5600000000002s)]
*  Well, I would just encourage anyone watching to... [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1395.5600000000002s)]
*  Let's Google these people and do not accept medical care from them. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1398.6000000000001s)]
*  You don't... [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1402.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to be cut by an unreasonable ideologue. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1403.8400000000001s)]
*  Problem is you don't know who those ideologues are unless you start naming names. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1408.5600000000002s)]
*  It would be nice to have their names. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1412.0800000000002s)]
*  So you said not only do they plan to lower standards, but they already have. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1414.04s)]
*  Can you tell us what you mean? [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1419.12s)]
*  In fact, I'm delighted you said that because I don't want this to be about me. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1421.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'm the one sitting in front of the microphone. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1426.6s)]
*  I'm the one that was banned. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1428.96s)]
*  But the issue is so far beyond me. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1432.08s)]
*  In my 38 years of surgery, I have gradually watched the quality of training in young surgeons [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1436.6599999999999s)]
*  deteriorate. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1443.78s)]
*  Noticeably in my own little backyard, watching young surgeons come out that have no business [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1446.78s)]
*  operating by themselves. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1452.54s)]
*  You've seen that? [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1455.3s)]
*  I've seen that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1456.3s)]
*  Oh, yeah, absolutely. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1457.3s)]
*  I can give you some examples. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1458.3s)]
*  Please do. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1461.7399999999998s)]
*  This is actually a few years back. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1464.3799999999999s)]
*  I had a new surgeon in town at a hospital that I worked at. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1465.82s)]
*  I do breast reconstruction, so I work a lot with the surgeons. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1469.58s)]
*  Together they'll remove the cancerous breast sometimes. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1472.9399999999998s)]
*  A lot of times they'll remove the other breast simultaneously. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1476.4599999999998s)]
*  And then I will come in and do the reconstruction. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1479.62s)]
*  And I was doing a lot of these cases where you take the abdominal tissue and you create [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1481.5s)]
*  one or two breaths with the abdominal tissue, which is a great procedure, but very significant, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1485.86s)]
*  time consuming and whatnot. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1491.62s)]
*  And there's a lot of things that have to be done. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1494.3s)]
*  And this surgeon offered to help me close the abdominal part of the operation or to [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1496.26s)]
*  do it for me so that I could concentrate on the breast. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1501.86s)]
*  I said, great, this probably cut an hour and a half or two hours out of my operating time. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1504.34s)]
*  And so I glanced down to see what he was doing. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1509.62s)]
*  He's taking these massive bites of tissue. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1513.4199999999998s)]
*  And every time he ties a stitch down, I mean, the abdominal wall is broken. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1517.34s)]
*  It's being distorted. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1521.58s)]
*  I'm looking at him thinking, wow. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1523.46s)]
*  And I was able to, I could watch more than two or three stitches put in. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1525.86s)]
*  And I said, Joe, listen, you got things to do. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1530.1399999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1535.46s)]
*  I'm fine. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1536.46s)]
*  I don't need the help. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1537.46s)]
*  And he left. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1538.46s)]
*  And- [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1539.46s)]
*  Was this someone who's out of medical school? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1540.46s)]
*  This was a fully trained surgeon, just newly, just helping to practice in my community. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1543.54s)]
*  And it didn't last very long. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1548.5s)]
*  It became very obvious soon because in small hospitals you can't hide that he was not very [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1549.66s)]
*  competent and he eventually moved on. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1554.74s)]
*  I don't know where he went or what he did. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1557.02s)]
*  But it was obvious to you just from looking down this guy was not qualified. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1559.38s)]
*  This guy had no clue how to close an abdomen. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1563.14s)]
*  I mean, it was really bizarre. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1565.34s)]
*  And that's kind of an extreme example. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1567.9s)]
*  How did he become a surgeon? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1569.06s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1571.54s)]
*  Lowered standards, basically. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1574.3s)]
*  Was this person from a protected racial group or- [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1575.66s)]
*  No, no, he was not. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1577.98s)]
*  He was your heteronormative white male like me, basically. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1579.18s)]
*  But he was incompetent. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1582.8200000000002s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1584.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1585.7s)]
*  Well, I only saw this one example, but the thing speaks for itself. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1586.7s)]
*  If a person is doing this in such a simple situation, such as closing an abdominal wall, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1590.02s)]
*  then you got to wonder what he's like. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1595.5s)]
*  And I've worked with other surgeons that were, there's a couple that I refuse to work with [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1597.5800000000002s)]
*  that you often have to ask yourself, is this something that I report? [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1603.86s)]
*  I don't report. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1610.1799999999998s)]
*  I've spoken to colleagues and so forth. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1611.8999999999999s)]
*  I've only actually reported one or two doctors in my career because the circumstances are [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1614.9799999999998s)]
*  so egregious. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1619.9399999999998s)]
*  And these didn't happen to be surgeons, by the way. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1620.9399999999998s)]
*  But kind of getting off track a little bit. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1623.82s)]
*  I work with a young surgeon, arguably a good surgeon. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1626.1399999999999s)]
*  And I was doing again a breast reconstruction and he made a comment to me that I found astounding. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1631.34s)]
*  One of the common accompanying things you do in breast cancer treatment is a lot of [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1636.98s)]
*  times you go after lymph nodes in the armpit because you want to see if there's cancer [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1642.4599999999998s)]
*  there or if there's cancer there, you want to remove the cancer. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1646.4599999999998s)]
*  And that's called an axillary node dissection. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1649.62s)]
*  Basic operation. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1652.54s)]
*  Even I know about it. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1653.54s)]
*  Every general surgeon learns that. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1654.54s)]
*  When we were doing a case and he was doing a biopsy in the armpit removing a single lymph [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1657.06s)]
*  node and he commented, he says, you know, I'm really glad I don't have to do an axillary [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1662.98s)]
*  node dissection because I've never done one before. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  This is a fully trained board certified general surgeon. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1669.54s)]
*  Had never done an axillary node dissection in the course of his five years of general [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1672.72s)]
*  surgery training. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1677.36s)]
*  Let me stick back a second to when you ask about quality and how it's gone down. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1678.8999999999999s)]
*  It's not a conscious thing. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1685.98s)]
*  It's not been deliberate. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1687.46s)]
*  I don't think that we have gone out deliberately to create a decline in the quality of surgery. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1688.46s)]
*  I think a lot of circumstances have come together to do that. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1694.02s)]
*  One was in 2003, the American Graduate Medical Education. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1698.9s)]
*  They came out and they took a law that was basically confined to New York from 1964 and [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1703.32s)]
*  made it nationwide. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1709.38s)]
*  And that law was a reduction of residency hours. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1710.38s)]
*  In other words, you can't take a trainee in any medical specialty and make them work more [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1713.1799999999998s)]
*  than 80 hours a week or more than 24 hours at a stretch. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1719.6599999999999s)]
*  And so that reduced residency hours dramatically because when I trained, it was not uncommon [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1723.6999999999998s)]
*  to work a 90 to 110 hour week. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1728.4199999999998s)]
*  That was pretty typical. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1730.4599999999998s)]
*  And be on call, you know, 36 hours straight. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1732.1s)]
*  I once worked 48 hours straight. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1734.86s)]
*  Not that that's a great thing, but you know, you do what you have to do and you learn. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1737.5s)]
*  You learn to operate under circumstances when you're tired and things like that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1740.78s)]
*  And the idea was to reduce medical errors and things like that, which has been disproven. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1746.06s)]
*  Studies have shown that that reduction in hours did nothing to improve medical errors. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1750.86s)]
*  But that was one thing that cut back the hours for training and surgery. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1756.82s)]
*  You know, you have a very limited- [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1761.14s)]
*  What was the motive there? [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1762.14s)]
*  The idea behind it, the reason that it occurred was because of a death. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1766.02s)]
*  A young woman died in New York because of a medical drug error, a very rare drug reaction. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1769.94s)]
*  And her father happened to be a very prominent attorney. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1780.1399999999999s)]
*  And he decided that the reason was that these residents were working too hard, they were [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1783.22s)]
*  too tired, and we needed to change that. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1787.66s)]
*  And there was this spate of New York Times stories about this. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1789.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1792.02s)]
*  I remember this. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1793.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1794.02s)]
*  And the New York Times was only confined to New York until 2003. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1795.02s)]
*  They didn't become a nationwide thing. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1796.98s)]
*  General surgery is a five-year residency program. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1800.62s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1803.1399999999999s)]
*  In the first two years, you learn patient care. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1804.1399999999999s)]
*  You learn how to take care of patients before and after you assist in operations. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1806.58s)]
*  You do diagnostic, differential diagnosis, and you learn how to work up a problem. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1811.74s)]
*  And if you're good, if you're a good intern, if you're a good first-year, second-year resident, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1818.22s)]
*  you know, they throw your bone on again. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1822.82s)]
*  They'll let you do a hernia, and they'll let you do an appendectomy, and they hold your [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1824.3400000000001s)]
*  hand while you do it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1827.7s)]
*  And then in the third and fourth years, you start to operate more. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1829.54s)]
*  But you're always operating under the direct supervision of a senior resident or an attending, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1833.98s)]
*  attending as a fully-trained surgeon. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1840.54s)]
*  And again, you're having your hands held. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1842.66s)]
*  I mean, they have to let you work. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1844.66s)]
*  They got to put the knife in your hand. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1846.14s)]
*  But they have to be good enough to do that and keep you out of trouble. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1848.3600000000001s)]
*  And if you get in trouble, to get you out of trouble. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1851.98s)]
*  And so you spend those three to four years kind of honing your skills. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1854.58s)]
*  And then in the fifth year, when you are what we call a chief resident, you're basically [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1857.76s)]
*  regarded as being a surgeon. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1863.34s)]
*  And you do your cases. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1864.98s)]
*  You assist the younger surgeons in their cases. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1867.8s)]
*  And the only time you call an attending surgeon in is if you're doing something very major, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1870.58s)]
*  very complex, or if you haven't done this before. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1874.18s)]
*  And so at the end of that fifth year, you should be able to walk out of the hospital [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1878.18s)]
*  and go anywhere and operate as a general surgeon and function fully independently. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1882.94s)]
*  A study done in 2014 in the annals of surgery reported that 80% of the graduating general [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1889.8600000000001s)]
*  surgeons were not going into practice. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1900.1000000000001s)]
*  They were going on to do a fellowship. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1903.46s)]
*  Fellowship is additional. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1906.98s)]
*  80%. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1908.78s)]
*  Fellowships in whatever. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1909.78s)]
*  Thoracic surgery, vascular surgery, colorectal, you name it. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1910.78s)]
*  And that was in 2014. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1915.78s)]
*  They surveyed program directors. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1921.58s)]
*  These are the chiefs, the heads of surgical programs to find out what these residents [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1923.8600000000001s)]
*  that they were getting, what these surgeons that they were getting in Phillips were like. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1928.9s)]
*  They found out that 66% of them could not be relied upon to operate independently for [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1933.86s)]
*  more than about 30 minutes. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1940.46s)]
*  That something like 30% or so could not handle tissues in a manner that was appropriate, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1943.82s)]
*  atraumatically, if you will. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1950.8999999999999s)]
*  20, 30% couldn't sew properly. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1953.22s)]
*  Close to the same number couldn't identify the early signs of a complication. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1958.86s)]
*  Some could not identify an anatomical tissue plane. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1964.1000000000001s)]
*  These are people that are graduates of general surgery residencies coming out of these programs [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1967.22s)]
*  and going into fellowships. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1971.54s)]
*  The saddest thing is that when they survey the young surgeons themselves and say, well, [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1973.22s)]
*  why are you going into this fellowship instead of going out and practicing, more than half [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1979.06s)]
*  say it's because they did not feel comfortable operating independently after five years of [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1983.74s)]
*  training. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1989.7s)]
*  So there's something very wrong with the training they're getting. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1990.7s)]
*  They're not getting enough cases to do. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1992.6999999999998s)]
*  They're not being allowed to operate. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1995.86s)]
*  In some places, the attending surgeons are very hesitant to hand over a case to a younger [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=1998.54s)]
*  surgeon because, number one, they're responsible for that case. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2004.98s)]
*  Number two, you're never going to be as efficient or fast as a young surgeon as you will later [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2009.34s)]
*  on when you've had more experience. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2014.74s)]
*  So it takes longer and impacts your day or schedule. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2016.3799999999999s)]
*  It's sad because they recognize this. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2022.54s)]
*  These youngsters recognize this. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2025.8999999999999s)]
*  So the question is, it sounds like a total failure to train the next generation of surgeons. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2026.8999999999999s)]
*  It's a system failure. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2032.98s)]
*  And the ACS recognizes this. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2034.8999999999999s)]
*  You know how I know that? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2036.7s)]
*  It's because since 2014, they've initiated what they call a mentorship program. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2038.26s)]
*  What they do is they try to find experienced surgeons that will mentor these young surgeons [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2043.82s)]
*  to help them come up to speed. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2050.1s)]
*  So a young surgeon out of training that should be able to work on their own and find that [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2052.14s)]
*  they're struggling or not really able to do that, they would have an experienced surgeon [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2057.94s)]
*  to, I don't want to say hold their hand, but to oversee them, supervise them, scrub with [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2062.9s)]
*  them. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2068.18s)]
*  They can't find enough surgeons to do that, for one thing. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2069.18s)]
*  Here the DEI really comes in, too. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2071.66s)]
*  They have this idea of racial concordance that what they need to do is find, if it's [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2074.46s)]
*  a black surgeon, they've got to find a black mentor for him. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2078.26s)]
*  And if it's a Hispanic surgeon, they've got to find a Hispanic mentor. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2081.6600000000003s)]
*  And there's not enough of those to go around. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2084.6200000000003s)]
*  It's the time of year we focus on the people who matter most in our lives. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2086.1000000000004s)]
*  And if there's one way to show your family, the people you love, that you love them, it's [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2088.9s)]
*  by protecting their health and their safety. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2093.42s)]
*  And a really obvious way to do that is by preparing for unpredicted moments. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2095.6200000000003s)]
*  And there are a lot of those. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2100.78s)]
*  Breakdown on supply chains, overwhelmed hospitals, natural disasters, wars. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2102.0600000000004s)]
*  Whatever happens next, you can't see it coming, but you can be prepared for most of it. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2107.34s)]
*  And that's why a JACE case works. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2110.94s)]
*  A JACE case is a personal supply of prescribed emergency medications. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2113.42s)]
*  So if things fall apart, you're okay. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2118.06s)]
*  There's an unexpected global disruption. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2120.98s)]
*  You can protect yourself and your loved ones. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2123.02s)]
*  So this February, show them you care. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2125.46s)]
*  Get the JACE case today. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2128.02s)]
*  You'll have the right meds on hand when you need them. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2129.2200000000003s)]
*  You only need them once. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2132.78s)]
*  You ought to have them. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2133.78s)]
*  So in addition to what are demonstrable, provable failures of medical schools to train the next [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2135.18s)]
*  generation of surgeons, and can I just say parenthetically, I feel like if they're not [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2142.14s)]
*  training surgeons adequately, surgeons are a small percentage of all physicians, probably [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2145.8199999999997s)]
*  the most important, but they're probably not, and probably the smartest and most driven, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2151.14s)]
*  then they're probably failing. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2155.42s)]
*  I'll agree with you on that. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2156.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2157.9s)]
*  They're surgeons. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2158.9s)]
*  It's the most straightforward kind of medicine. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2159.9s)]
*  So but in addition to that, they overlay these racial mandates. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2162.26s)]
*  They decide that racism is the real problem, not incompetence. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2171.7400000000002s)]
*  And then they put these mandates in where you have to somehow have doctors of all these [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2175.2200000000003s)]
*  different backgrounds, which you don't have. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2181.86s)]
*  So what happens when... [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2184.38s)]
*  Everything starts to go downhill really quickly. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2186.46s)]
*  I have... [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2190.7799999999997s)]
*  I get... [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2191.7799999999997s)]
*  People contact me just because of my profile has been elevated by being out there a little [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2192.7799999999997s)]
*  bit. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2197.7799999999997s)]
*  I got a call from a young plastic surgery resident that had been fully trained in general [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2198.7799999999997s)]
*  surgery and went on to begin her plastic surgery training. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2206.54s)]
*  And she was concerned because she wanted to get the most out of her training. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2211.3799999999997s)]
*  And so she reached out to me to find out what things she could do. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2214.2999999999997s)]
*  She told me things that are unbelievable. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2217.9799999999996s)]
*  I mean, I'd never imagined these things. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2219.34s)]
*  And this has been confirmed, not... [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2221.1000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't just my conversation with her. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2222.46s)]
*  I've confirmed it from other sources as well. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2224.7400000000002s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2227.5s)]
*  One, as she talked about the difficulty getting enough cases under your belt, that is, not [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2228.5s)]
*  getting given cases to do, not having operations that you can actually perform, not having [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2234.2200000000003s)]
*  the attendings turn things over to you. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2239.7400000000002s)]
*  This I could not believe. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2244.38s)]
*  One of the requisites to become more certified, at least in surgery, is you have to turn over [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2246.66s)]
*  to the board of examiners for the American Board of Surgery, the American Board of Plastic [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2252.18s)]
*  Surgery, a log of the cases you have done in the course of your residency program. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2257.8199999999997s)]
*  So they list every case you've done as a surgeon, as an assistant, and whatnot. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2263.8199999999997s)]
*  Well, they're now permitted to list operations in there as part of the surgical experience [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2270.06s)]
*  that they've only watched. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2275.34s)]
*  So if they sit behind the anesthesia screen or look over the shoulder of the surgeon and [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2277.7400000000002s)]
*  watch an operation, they can list that in the logbook as part of their surgical experience. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2285.26s)]
*  And I can tell you personally that you don't learn surgery that way. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2290.1800000000003s)]
*  You learn by getting your hands in there. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2292.98s)]
*  I've watched a lot of medical shows. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2294.5s)]
*  I'm not a doctor as a result. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2296.0600000000004s)]
*  And that's what's scary. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2298.98s)]
*  And that allows them to qualify for taking their boards. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2300.26s)]
*  The other thing they do, which is really... [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2304.32s)]
*  What would be, again, the motive there? [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2305.76s)]
*  Why would you allow that? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2307.44s)]
*  Well, the ACS has already anticipated there's going to be a shortage of 19,000 surgeons [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2309.4s)]
*  by 2030. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2314.96s)]
*  Five years from now, we're going to be shying nearly 20,000 surgeons in this country. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2317.2000000000003s)]
*  Right now, the USA is short 1,200 trauma surgeons. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2321.92s)]
*  There are places that need a trauma surgeon that can't get one because they're just not [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2325.86s)]
*  around. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2328.8s)]
*  So one idea, as bad as it may be, is to put out anybody and everybody and you don't want [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2329.88s)]
*  to drop anybody just so you can get the numbers up there. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2336.34s)]
*  The... [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2341.08s)]
*  Gosh, there's so much to this, Tucker, that goes into this. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2342.08s)]
*  Well, back to the... [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2347.52s)]
*  I mean, all of this begins at the front end of the pipeline, which is medical school. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2349.6800000000003s)]
*  So the standards for admission to medical school have been dropped dramatically for [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2356.56s)]
*  race reasons. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2361.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2363.7999999999997s)]
*  They've taken the medical licensee examination, the three-part medical licensee examination, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  taken it from a graded exam to a pass-fail. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2369.32s)]
*  And to pass it, you only have to be above the bottom 5% in grade. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2373.4s)]
*  If you are above the bottom 5%, you are going to pass the medical licensure examinations. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2379.68s)]
*  In spite of that, which is an abysmal standard when you think about it, in spite of that, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2384.92s)]
*  something like 10% or more students at UCLA, 10% or more students flunk one or more of [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2389.6s)]
*  the exams and a number of them flunked these exams two and three times. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2397.2400000000002s)]
*  And yet, they're still being put through medical school. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2401.76s)]
*  They don't want to drop you. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2404.6400000000003s)]
*  I know what I wanted to say. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2405.6400000000003s)]
*  Again, back to the DEI for a second. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2407.96s)]
*  If you're attending in a surgical training program and you have a surgeon that is inadequate, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2411.3s)]
*  he's just not cutting it. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2419.5800000000004s)]
*  And I saw this. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2420.7400000000002s)]
*  I had, while I was in training, there were surgeons or people that came into the program [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2422.02s)]
*  that were dropped after year two. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2426.94s)]
*  It was clear that they weren't going to be able to do it. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2428.26s)]
*  They just didn't have the dexterity. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2430.82s)]
*  They didn't have the whatever. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2432.98s)]
*  Today, if you do that, and it's a minority or underrepresented in medicine, minority [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2435.7s)]
*  surgeon, as an attending, if you hold them back or if you drop them, what's going to [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2442.8199999999997s)]
*  happen is you're going to get reported. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2448.2999999999997s)]
*  You'll get reported to the DEI establishment in that program. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2450.06s)]
*  And invariably, they're going to side with the resident and not with the attending. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2455.58s)]
*  Why do they have the moral high ground if they're putting people's lives at risk, which [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2459.74s)]
*  they are? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2462.4599999999996s)]
*  I mean, I think that's a crime. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2464.46s)]
*  But how did they get to attack you for upholding objective standards of surgery? [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2466.38s)]
*  I just don't get the, like, are there no sane people left in American medicine? [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2471.06s)]
*  Well, the thing is this. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2475.3s)]
*  How do you recognize the quality going down? [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2476.62s)]
*  How do you recognize bad surgery? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2479.62s)]
*  And one way that you recognize that is by complications. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2481.5s)]
*  So the question would be, are people dying? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2486.1s)]
*  Are complications going up? [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2489.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2490.9s)]
*  In surgery. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2491.9s)]
*  Right now, you can't answer that question. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2493.34s)]
*  And one big reason why you can't answer the question is that, at least, and I'll just [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2496.14s)]
*  say this is my opinion, I can't keep quoting this, but I know this is how surgery has evolved. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2501.14s)]
*  The vast majority of surgery done today is done as an outpatient. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2506.6600000000003s)]
*  So the people that are in the hospital and have an operation are not the majority. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2510.1s)]
*  They're the minority. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2515.82s)]
*  So if you do outpatient surgery, you do the operation, you know, the patient goes home. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2517.78s)]
*  After an overnight stay, most complications don't arise immediately. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2523.7400000000002s)]
*  You know, bleeding occurs in the first day or two after, infections three, four days, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2528.1400000000003s)]
*  okay? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2532.78s)]
*  Pulmonary problems. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2533.78s)]
*  In my particular profession, if I do a flap reconstruction, I may not know if that flap's [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2534.94s)]
*  going to live or die for five, six, seven days or more. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2539.7400000000002s)]
*  So when you do have complications, they occur after the patient's out of the system, so [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2543.04s)]
*  to speak, out of the hospital system. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2547.6600000000003s)]
*  So there's no required reporting. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2549.1800000000003s)]
*  It's all self-reporting. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2553.42s)]
*  You know, you get a letter periodically from the hospital to say, hey, can you please tell [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2554.42s)]
*  us how all of your patients did? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2557.8199999999997s)]
*  Do you have any other complications? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2559.58s)]
*  Well, they did great. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2560.58s)]
*  They did great. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2561.58s)]
*  Well, and it's human nature. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2562.58s)]
*  Of course. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2564.58s)]
*  If a patient gets an infection, you treat them with antibiotics, you know, do you report [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2565.58s)]
*  that as a complication? [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2568.7799999999997s)]
*  And the patient ultimately did okay. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2569.7799999999997s)]
*  You could argue no, you would probably, you might not report that, and you could rationalize [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2572.74s)]
*  that it's okay. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2577.02s)]
*  So that's one of the issues. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2579.02s)]
*  The other issue, and I got this directly from one of the examiners. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2580.7s)]
*  I know someone who has been examining surgeons for 15 years for their boards. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2583.58s)]
*  So when you go to take your board examination, say he's one of the people that sits in the [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2590.22s)]
*  room and asks you questions and whatnot. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2593.7s)]
*  And what he's noticed is that a lot of these residents are coming in, he's looking at their [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2597.08s)]
*  cases and he's thinking, oh my gosh, they're taking way too long to do these operations. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2601.42s)]
*  Now one thing that's interesting is when you go for your boards, the cases that they [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2608.22s)]
*  look at are not cases you did in training. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2613.2599999999998s)]
*  These are cases you've done since you've been out. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2615.8599999999997s)]
*  When you finish your residency, you're allowed to go out and practice. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2618.9399999999996s)]
*  I could practice, I practiced for two years before I became board certified because it [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2621.98s)]
*  took two years to get my board certification. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2625.4599999999996s)]
*  So of course I have to be able to practice. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2627.98s)]
*  And I'm regarded at that point as a board eligible surgeon. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2630.16s)]
*  And I'm entitled to full privileges and all those things. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2633.58s)]
*  So when I go to take my board examination, I present them, in my case I present them [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2637.14s)]
*  with a log of everything I had done for the past year. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2642.2999999999997s)]
*  And they select cases to examine you on and so forth. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2645.8599999999997s)]
*  It's an interesting experience to do that. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2649.74s)]
*  So these are the cases that these examiners are looking at. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2652.02s)]
*  And he's saying, they're taking way too long. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2654.44s)]
*  Here's an operation that should normally take three to four hours. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2656.7799999999997s)]
*  It's taking seven to eight hours for this person to complete this operation. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2659.5s)]
*  And I've seen this locally. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2662.3399999999997s)]
*  I've seen this in my own community where nurses who know the good surgeons from the bad surgeons [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2663.54s)]
*  say, Dr. So-and-so, he's so slow. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2668.58s)]
*  He just takes forever to do this operation. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2671.34s)]
*  And complications are directly tied to length of surgery. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2675.34s)]
*  I mean, absolutely positively correlated. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2678.6600000000003s)]
*  The longer the surgery, the more potential complication. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2681.1400000000003s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2684.86s)]
*  And this is recognized and is recognized in a very interesting way. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2685.86s)]
*  The CMS, the Centers for Medicine, Medicare, and Medicaid. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2688.9s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2695.74s)]
*  They've come out and they said, we are not going to pay for anesthesia beyond a certain [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2696.74s)]
*  time. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2701.8199999999997s)]
*  So if we have, for example, a breast reduction, which for me is about a three and a half to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2702.8199999999997s)]
*  four hour operation, we'll pay for four hours of anesthesia for breast reduction. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2708.2999999999997s)]
*  If it goes beyond that, we're not paying for that additional time. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2713.62s)]
*  The idea is they recognize that people are taking too long to do these things. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2718.74s)]
*  Point is, anesthesia has nothing to do with the length of surgery. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2724.62s)]
*  They're just there to keep the patient asleep and stable and alive for you while you're [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2727.8599999999997s)]
*  doing an operation. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2731.06s)]
*  But that's the only way they can think to penalize the surgeon because the surgical [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2732.1s)]
*  time does not come into play unless you look at hospital charges or anesthesia charges. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2737.14s)]
*  And so they recognize this. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2742.8199999999997s)]
*  And this goes back to what I said. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2743.94s)]
*  A lot of surgeons are not getting enough surgical experience to be able to operate, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2745.98s)]
*  one, independently, and two, I would say efficiently, competently to do. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2750.14s)]
*  I'm not a speedster, but I can certainly hold my own with my peers in terms of how long [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2756.26s)]
*  it takes me to finish an operation and do a good job on it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2760.7s)]
*  I've never tried to be the fastest guy on the block. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2764.7400000000002s)]
*  So all those things go to the fact that you're not going to really recognize this decline [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2768.34s)]
*  because it's so subtle in so many respects. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2774.06s)]
*  And patients don't know that. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2777.2200000000003s)]
*  And that's the other reason why I'm here, Tucker. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2778.54s)]
*  I want this to be a wake-up call to my fellow surgeons. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2781.7400000000002s)]
*  This is what can happen to you if you speak up and you try to promote excellence in surgery [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  and you try to object or push back against a liberal ideology, politics, ideology, call [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2791.38s)]
*  it what you will, in surgery. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2798.5s)]
*  And I would love for there to be a groundswell of surgeons coming out saying, hey, wait [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2800.9s)]
*  a minute, what's going on in my profession? [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2805.34s)]
*  Well, the fact that there isn't really bothers me because it's more than physical dexterity. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2806.86s)]
*  You're counting on, as a patient, reason. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2812.94s)]
*  You want a fact-based, logical physician or else you could die. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2816.44s)]
*  And so anyone who accepts clearly illogical, unreasonable suppositions and doesn't push [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2822.58s)]
*  back against them is basically involved in witchcraft. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2830.9s)]
*  Right? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2834.86s)]
*  So if I could say to you something that is provably untrue and just on its face, stupid, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2835.86s)]
*  which is a black female patient needs a black female doctor, it's like, what are you even [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2841.22s)]
*  saying? [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2847.2999999999997s)]
*  Show me the evidence. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2848.2999999999997s)]
*  There is no evidence. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2849.2999999999997s)]
*  It's crazy on its face. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2850.2999999999997s)]
*  And so you could say, well, good people are going along with this. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2852.02s)]
*  Well, no, they're disqualified by the fact they are going along with it. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2855.54s)]
*  As a patient, someone has undergone two surgeries. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2869.94s)]
*  Is that a fair view, do you think? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2874.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2876.0600000000004s)]
*  I mean, think about this. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2877.0600000000004s)]
*  You're an intelligent person. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2878.0600000000004s)]
*  You have probably a wealth of experience because of what you do. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2879.5s)]
*  You weren't aware of racial concordance. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2884.18s)]
*  And I mean, you ask any guy in the street about that, they're going to just look at [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2887.06s)]
*  you like, you know, you have two heads. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2890.36s)]
*  What the heck is that? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2891.9s)]
*  Well, is it true? [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2892.9s)]
*  And if it's true, how is that true? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2894.3s)]
*  Again, the rest of us trust science, not because we trust the people who carry it out, but [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2896.46s)]
*  because the idea itself is inherently reasonable. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2902.54s)]
*  Prove it or I don't believe it. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2905.82s)]
*  The burden of proof is on the practitioner, the scientist, the physician, the surgeon. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2908.58s)]
*  And the whole system is based on that. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2913.94s)]
*  If you can't prove it, then you can't know it. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2915.42s)]
*  I thought that that's science, right? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2916.98s)]
*  Well, that's what they call evidence-based medicine, which is... [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2918.42s)]
*  Well, right. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2920.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2921.98s)]
*  But that's all medicine should be evidence-based medicine. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2922.98s)]
*  And if it's not evidence-based medicine, it's not really medicine, it's witchcraft. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2925.06s)]
*  So it freaks me out that the average doctor, average surgeon would for a second go along [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2927.7799999999997s)]
*  with this. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2935.58s)]
*  Well, think about it from this standpoint, too. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2936.62s)]
*  Think about the, for example, Celia Nelson, the female Jamaican black surgeon that was [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2938.7s)]
*  on the Zoom call with me. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2943.98s)]
*  She's worked as hard as anybody to get to where she is. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2946.2999999999997s)]
*  She's an excellent surgeon. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2951.22s)]
*  She's experienced racism. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2953.98s)]
*  And she'll tell you flat out, yeah, when she first arrived there, people would mistake [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2955.46s)]
*  her for, you know, ask her to get a cup of coffee in the surgeon's lap, you know, those [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2960.46s)]
*  sorts of things. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2963.7s)]
*  And she also noticed that sometimes when she'd walk into an exam room, in the emergency [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2965.3s)]
*  room, that, you know, the look she would get was, you know, who is this? [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2970.02s)]
*  Is this someone good? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2975.46s)]
*  And she's worked through all that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2977.26s)]
*  Okay, she's worked through that. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2978.5s)]
*  She just put her head down. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2980.54s)]
*  She worked hard. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2981.54s)]
*  And now she says what happens is when she goes into the ER, that patient has already [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2983.46s)]
*  heard from multiple staff what a wonderful surgeon they're getting, that she's going [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2988.34s)]
*  to be in there to see them. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2992.44s)]
*  So she's earned her place. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2993.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2996.6800000000003s)]
*  But think how unfair it is for the people coming up now, the minority, if you will, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=2997.6800000000003s)]
*  surgeons that have to face this idea when they go into a room, that person may look [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3003.2000000000003s)]
*  and say, gee, is this a DEI hire or is this a person that really- [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3008.28s)]
*  I think everyone thinks that. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3012.28s)]
*  That went through, that got here because of their excellence, because of their excellent [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3013.44s)]
*  academic performance in college and medical school, because their excellent performance [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3018.36s)]
*  in their residency, because they met all the standards, the standards that everyone should [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3022.7599999999998s)]
*  have to meet. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3028.44s)]
*  Or am I getting someone who's a little bit less because of this? [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3030.08s)]
*  And that's part of the- [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3034.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, of course you're getting someone less. [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3035.9199999999996s)]
*  You're getting someone less overwhelmingly. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3036.9199999999996s)]
*  And that's obvious. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3039.12s)]
*  And it has nothing to do with race, by the way. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3040.12s)]
*  It's that preferences are always destructive of excellence. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3042.9199999999996s)]
*  So if you tell me that you're the CEO of a company that your family owns and you got [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3047.16s)]
*  the job because you're the first son, my first assumption is they lowered standards to make [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3053.2s)]
*  you CEO. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3059.54s)]
*  I mean, right? [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3060.54s)]
*  It's obvious. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3063.0s)]
*  And so if I have a black female surgeon, my first assumption will be this person had to [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3064.04s)]
*  meet lower standards because the school or the certifying board was so anxious to say [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3069.64s)]
*  we have a black female surgeon. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3073.8599999999997s)]
*  And of course it's unfair to the individual, but then the whole system is unfair. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3076.04s)]
*  So should you be shocked that it produces unfair results? [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3079.2799999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3082.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's unfair. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3083.2799999999997s)]
*  It is unfair. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3084.2799999999997s)]
*  On the face of it and in practice and every other possible way. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3085.2799999999997s)]
*  The thing about anti-racism that was so, I think, despicable was it said that you cannot [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3089.2799999999997s)]
*  be against racism. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3097.2799999999997s)]
*  You have to be for this whole anti-racism schtick. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3098.2799999999997s)]
*  Attacking whites. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3102.56s)]
*  So if you claim to be not a racist, that's a racist statement. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3104.44s)]
*  I mean, talk about the... [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3110.24s)]
*  But why would anyone go, of course, I mean, it's a Chinese finger trap. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3113.16s)]
*  The harder you pull to get out, the more stuck you are. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3117.52s)]
*  But why would anybody, you're a surgeon, like you're at the very pinnacle of our system, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3119.24s)]
*  like the science-based, reason-based civilization that we've built, which we consider superior [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3125.7999999999997s)]
*  to the witchcraft-based societies of the rest of the world. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3132.14s)]
*  How in the world could you sit and let this happen? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3138.3799999999997s)]
*  Anybody, any surgeon? [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3141.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you why I did it. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3143.8199999999997s)]
*  I was too busy. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3146.62s)]
*  I was just, I had my head in the sand. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3147.94s)]
*  Well, you're the anomaly. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3149.3399999999997s)]
*  You actually stood up like a band for standing up. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3150.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying, what about all your colleagues? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3152.1s)]
*  I'm fortunate in the sense that I was able to get through a career and I'm at the twilight [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3154.2999999999997s)]
*  of my career, no, actually at the end of my career. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3160.18s)]
*  I have nothing to lose, Tucker. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3162.02s)]
*  I mean, they can't hurt me. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3163.5s)]
*  So I got many messages, private messages, which I can't access any longer from surgeons, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3165.2799999999997s)]
*  including minority surgeons that said, we agree with you, but we can't speak up because [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3171.8999999999996s)]
*  we're going to get pushed back. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3176.94s)]
*  We're going to be called Uncle Tom's or racist or whatever if we agree with the premise that [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3179.2599999999998s)]
*  you're putting out there. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3184.8999999999996s)]
*  I don't have much to lose. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3186.5s)]
*  Christmas is here, the period before Easter, the 40 days, and it's a unique chance to [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3188.94s)]
*  get closer to God. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3193.34s)]
*  That's the point of it. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3194.46s)]

*  No, I mean, of course I know that you're describing the real answer. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3257.94s)]
*  That is the answer. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3261.1800000000003s)]
*  But it's just hard to let people like that off the hook. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3262.7400000000002s)]
*  If you work in some normal company, it's one thing. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3265.6s)]
*  But if you're a surgeon, you understand that lowering standards results in the deaths of people. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3268.38s)]
*  The stakes are just the highest in any part of our society. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3274.6600000000003s)]
*  You have the highest stakes. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3278.1400000000003s)]
*  So sure it could hurt your career. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3280.54s)]
*  Sure it could make you unpopular. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3282.7000000000003s)]
*  Sure they might call you names, Uncle Tom or whatever. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3284.1s)]
*  But you balance that against the deaths of innocence and you think I have to say something, don't you? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3286.3s)]
*  And if you don't, then I can tell and bless you. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3292.02s)]
*  But if you decide, you know, people will die, but my career is more important or not being called names is more important, [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3296.54s)]
*  then it's kind of a monster, aren't you? [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3301.94s)]
*  I don't want to say that. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3305.9s)]
*  I do. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3308.18s)]
*  I think that if you give the power that surgeons have the power to cut people open unsupervised [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3309.18s)]
*  and someone dies and you're the surgeon, you're like God in the operating room. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3315.7s)]
*  You have that power in exchange for that power. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3319.42s)]
*  You have to hold yourself to the highest moral standards. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3322.38s)]
*  I agree with that. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3325.5s)]
*  You'll get no argument from me. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3326.5s)]
*  Who has more power than a surgeon? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3328.82s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3330.78s)]
*  In that immediate moment, nobody does. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3331.78s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3333.58s)]
*  I mean actual power, not theoretical power. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3334.58s)]
*  A surgeon is more power than the president. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3336.7400000000002s)]
*  He can cut open a person, the person's unconscious. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3338.5s)]
*  He has total control over his operating room. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3341.66s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong in any of this. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3343.38s)]
*  The captain of the ship, basically. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3345.38s)]
*  Unquestioned, right? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3347.54s)]
*  And he has a life in his hands, like actual, not theoretical, actual beating heart person. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3350.34s)]
*  And so that person has to be of just the highest moral caliber or else innocents die. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3355.26s)]
*  I mean that's my view. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3362.1800000000003s)]
*  Anything which works against that, you have to fight. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3364.26s)]
*  I think you have to work against that. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3366.86s)]
*  It's disconcerting to me. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3370.5400000000004s)]
*  I have to say maybe I can use stronger terms, but I get a lot of private affirmation from [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3372.2200000000003s)]
*  colleagues, from surgeons. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3379.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't get a lot of public affirmation for that very reason because some of them are [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3380.9s)]
*  older and don't want to deal with the blowback, the repercussions and the recrimination that [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3385.58s)]
*  can occur. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3391.26s)]
*  Some of them, if you agree with the whole situation, crazy as it may be, all the DEI [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3392.54s)]
*  and so forth, and most of them were kind of like me. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3398.1800000000003s)]
*  They were just going along and too busy taking care of their patients to the best of their [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3400.78s)]
*  ability. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3404.34s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3405.34s)]
*  I've been doing this for 38 years and it's really not until about three or four years [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3407.34s)]
*  ago that I popped my head above the water, so to speak, and looked around and said, oh [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3411.1800000000003s)]
*  my gosh, the landscape out there has really changed. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3414.94s)]
*  This is not the field of medicine that I went into. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3417.9s)]
*  You'd like to think when you've devoted your life to a career or profession that you're [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3424.1400000000003s)]
*  going to leave it a little better than you got it. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3430.3s)]
*  I've built my practice on the shoulders of the people that went before and I have a very [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3433.86s)]
*  strong sense of responsibility that I have to honor the traditions and the efforts on [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3441.34s)]
*  my behalf to get me to where I was. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3446.78s)]
*  You want to think that you've done somewhat the same. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3449.6200000000003s)]
*  Now I wasn't a professor, I wasn't a researcher, but in taking care of patients I've always [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3451.5s)]
*  tried to honor the efforts of the people that train me and feel like I could go off. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3457.82s)]
*  Well I've got a generation behind me now. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3464.34s)]
*  I've got a daughter who's a physician, I've got a son-in-law, her husband who's a physician, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3466.1400000000003s)]
*  and I feel a very strong sense of obligation to someday when I can't do this anymore to [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3471.82s)]
*  say okay, I did the best I could to leave medicine in their hands better than I got [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3477.38s)]
*  it. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3482.1400000000003s)]
*  I can't say that. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3483.6200000000003s)]
*  It's tragic when you think about it to think that you're leaving a profession that you [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3484.98s)]
*  love and have committed your life to and it's in much worse shape than when it was put into [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3489.7000000000003s)]
*  your hands. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3495.34s)]
*  Yeah, this is not progress. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3496.34s)]
*  I take responsibility for that. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3498.42s)]
*  I take my own, but at the same time I think it's what happened to me. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3499.86s)]
*  If the AECS can ban me with the impunity that they have done without accountability, without [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3505.34s)]
*  even following their own bylaws for God's sakes, and they have no reason to engage with [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3513.06s)]
*  me, they can do this to anybody. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3521.02s)]
*  There's nobody out there who's safe and that's a pretty frightening proposition. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3523.2999999999997s)]
*  For those of us watching who aren't doctors, it eliminates all trust. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3528.7s)]
*  Don't trust doctors. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3535.34s)]
*  I don't want to go to the doctor. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3536.34s)]
*  I don't like doctors. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3537.34s)]
*  I loathe them. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3538.34s)]

*  You don't. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3540.34s)]
*  I don't. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3541.34s)]
*  COVID. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3542.9s)]

*  Me too. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3544.9s)]
*  I haven't been a doctor since COVID. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3545.9s)]
*  What happened in COVID was so egregiously wrong that I just couldn't ... I mean, I don't [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3547.9s)]
*  look at the CDC, the NIH, FDA in the same way any longer, public health officials. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3554.06s)]
*  And the other issue, I don't want to open a can of worms here, but the gender-affirming [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3560.06s)]
*  care. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3563.98s)]
*  I mean, how in God's name did we get to a point where you have ... My profession as far [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3564.98s)]
*  as surgery is concerned is probably the one most closely involved in the whole process [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3571.2999999999997s)]
*  of gender-affirming care because of the work we do. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3576.66s)]
*  And to have this concept that there's no such thing as male and female, that you can take [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3580.4599999999996s)]
*  a biological male and convert them to a woman and they're really a woman. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3585.4199999999996s)]
*  Proof of plastic surgery. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3588.62s)]
*  I mean, that is ... When you talk about witchcraft and voodoo, that is witchcraft and voodoo. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3589.62s)]
*  And all the scientific evidence is against it. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3593.3399999999997s)]
*  Do you know anyone who participates in it? [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3595.8999999999996s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3598.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3599.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3600.18s)]
*  I don't know people that are doing the gender-affirming care in minors. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3601.3799999999997s)]
*  And I want to be very clear. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3606.14s)]
*  If an adult thinks ... If an adult male man thinks he's a woman, and God bless them, I [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3607.14s)]
*  feel sorry for them. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3613.14s)]
*  Me too. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3614.14s)]
*  You really have to. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3615.14s)]
*  But they're an adult with agency to make decisions for themselves. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3616.14s)]
*  That's one thing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3620.7s)]
*  Minors is a whole different thing. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3622.18s)]
*  Have you met any plastic surgeons who've done surgeries on minors? [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3623.58s)]
*  Not that I know of personally, no. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3628.4199999999996s)]
*  I know some that are doing some of this, what they call euphemistically top surgery where [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3630.42s)]
*  they take off a breast. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3634.82s)]
*  But they're doing this in women that are adults. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3636.58s)]
*  They're taking off their breasts to turn them into ... Make them look more male-like. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3639.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't know anyone personally who's done this on children so far. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3644.02s)]
*  So you saw this with abortion. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3646.78s)]
*  Even when I was a child, there were doctors who said, I just don't believe in it. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3648.26s)]
*  I think it's immoral. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3652.06s)]
*  I'm not participating in it. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3653.06s)]
*  Now it's my impression that it's pretty hard to be a doctor unless you commit abortion, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3654.62s)]
*  I think you kind of have to. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3658.22s)]
*  As part of your training, if you're OB-GYN, I don't know that you can get through medical [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3659.7799999999997s)]
*  school without participating in an abortion, an elective abortion. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3663.2599999999998s)]
*  I can't speak of that because I think that there ... I know personally that that wasn't [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3667.1s)]
*  the case. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3671.18s)]
*  I'm aware it was not the case. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3672.18s)]
*  No, I know that. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3673.46s)]
*  But my sense is now in practice, if not officially, that is the case. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3674.7s)]
*  And it's extremely hard to be an OB-GYN resident and not participate in that. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3680.86s)]
*  And I wonder if we're moving toward that scenario with transgender surgery, where maybe you [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3688.58s)]
*  don't get certified as a plastic surgeon unless you participate in mutilating minors in the [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3696.7000000000003s)]
*  service of ideology. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3703.1s)]
*  Could you see that happening? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3704.1s)]
*  Oh, I could definitely see it happening. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3706.1s)]
*  It is happening. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3708.6200000000003s)]
*  It is being done. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3709.6200000000003s)]
*  Are people being forced to do it? [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3711.38s)]
*  I don't think that's necessarily the case. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3712.7799999999997s)]
*  I think people that are doing it are bought into the whole thing, and they're doing that [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3714.02s)]
*  because they're bought into it. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3718.38s)]
*  But that just seems to act against evidence, scientific evidence, as a scientist, physicians [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3720.74s)]
*  or scientists. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3727.8599999999997s)]
*  I'm saying the same thing 10 times in a row, but it just seems like you shouldn't be allowed [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3728.8599999999997s)]
*  to conduct science if you've shown that you don't believe in it. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3735.5s)]
*  As a resident in surgery, you don't have a lot of power in the sense of being able to [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3741.1s)]
*  say, I won't do this or I will do that. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3749.2599999999998s)]
*  You can't pick and choose what you're going to do. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3751.18s)]
*  When I was in training, we had an experimental clinical study going on to do bariatric weight [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3755.7s)]
*  reduction surgery. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3763.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3764.54s)]
*  We were approaching these bypasses through the chest and not the abdomen. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3765.54s)]
*  The attendings in our program came to us. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3772.18s)]
*  The resident said, listen, we understand this is an experimental program. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3776.7799999999997s)]
*  We're not going to make you do this. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3781.54s)]
*  We'll let you decide for yourselves if you want to do these cases. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3782.74s)]
*  There were three of us at my level, and two of us said no. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3786.66s)]
*  I was one of those, and the third one said, sure, he'd do it. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3791.2599999999998s)]
*  You did not want to participate. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3794.26s)]
*  I did not want to do that. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3795.26s)]
*  I didn't think it was a good operation, a good idea. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3797.0200000000004s)]
*  Long and short as that, the study showed that, yes, you could lose weight by doing this, [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3800.1000000000004s)]
*  but the weight came back. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3806.6200000000003s)]
*  These patients gained weight again. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3808.7400000000002s)]
*  It was pretty much abandoned. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3811.0200000000004s)]
*  We're talking back in 1984, thereabouts. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3812.5800000000004s)]
*  Of course, I remember one young woman who died directly as a result of the operation, [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3818.5400000000004s)]
*  which it wasn't that big a group of patients, and they had one death in that group. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3823.54s)]
*  You're not always allowed to make the decision about what you can do. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3829.26s)]
*  Now, if you're in a residency program and you've got surgeons that are doing gender-affirming [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3831.62s)]
*  surgery, again, in minors, and you don't want to participate in that, I can't speak to this. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3836.38s)]
*  I can't say that the resident has the ability to say, no, I'm not going to do that or I [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3843.3s)]
*  won't do that. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3847.34s)]
*  I do know that. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3848.98s)]
*  Are you familiar with the case of Atonheim? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3849.98s)]
*  I've interviewed him. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3853.46s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3854.46s)]
*  What a man he is. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3855.46s)]
*  Yes, one of my heroes. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3856.46s)]
*  There's someone who has true courage. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3858.46s)]
*  My courage is the courage of someone that doesn't have too much to lose. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3860.66s)]
*  His is the courage of someone who has everything to lose. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3863.22s)]
*  That guy, I don't know if he's, I didn't ask him, I don't know if he's a religious man, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3865.14s)]
*  but I could feel a moral power on that guy. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3869.66s)]
*  He is. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3872.14s)]
*  He is religious. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3873.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3874.14s)]
*  Look, I've become friends with him and I've actually had, call these divine moments, if [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3875.2999999999997s)]
*  you will, but I've made a couple of, just felt compelled to call him a couple of times [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3884.42s)]
*  and it just happened to be when he was in a really difficult down period and just needed [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3889.14s)]
*  someone to affirm what he was doing and to encourage him and so forth. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3894.8799999999997s)]
*  And so, I just happened to be the person that made that phone call. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3900.18s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3904.74s)]
*  So we become friends. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3906.18s)]
*  Good for you. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3907.18s)]
*  And he is definitely a religious person. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3908.18s)]
*  Good. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3910.54s)]
*  I could feel that on him. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3911.54s)]
*  I, you know. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3912.54s)]
*  And more than that, he's a moral person. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3913.54s)]
*  He has a strong sense of. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3915.54s)]
*  One follows the other. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3916.54s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3917.54s)]
*  And of all the people I've interviewed, boy, it's funny you mentioned him. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3918.54s)]
*  I've thought about him many times since that interview. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3921.14s)]
*  No, he's still in the thick of it. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3923.5s)]
*  He's still under indictment and he's still facing trial. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3924.98s)]
*  He's going to win. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3927.7799999999997s)]
*  Oh, he'll win. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3928.9s)]
*  Well, my suspicion is it's all going to be dropped because the reasons that have been [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3929.9s)]
*  brought to the accusations are so out there that they just can't stand. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3936.5800000000004s)]

*  It can be fixed, yes. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3958.22s)]
*  But you're talking about a long, the pipeline for surgery is five plus years. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3960.3399999999997s)]
*  So then you got the four years before the medical school. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3966.74s)]
*  So if you're going to fix the problem, you got to go back to the medical schools. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3969.3799999999997s)]
*  Honestly, you may have to go back to universities where people are being indoctrinated and all [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3973.06s)]
*  this social justice stuff where they feel that that's more important than what they're [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3977.74s)]
*  doing. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3981.7799999999997s)]
*  The young doctors think that righting historic wrongs is more important than taking care [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3982.7799999999997s)]
*  of the patient in front of them. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3987.42s)]
*  And you can't practice medicine that way. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3989.5s)]
*  That's just not, that's not medicine. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3991.06s)]
*  So it can be fixed. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3994.3s)]
*  It's going to be a generational problem. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3995.9s)]
*  It's going to take a long time. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3998.26s)]
*  We're going to be seeing the effects of this and paying the price for these policies and [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=3999.26s)]
*  these ideologies for probably my lifetime, I suspect, which brings up the issue. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4003.66s)]
*  You know, I'm a healthy guy, but every one of us is going to be someday needing a doctor [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4009.7000000000003s)]
*  and I don't know who I'm going to go to. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4015.74s)]
*  I somewhat semi seriously told friends and family, I said, don't go to a surgeon or a [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4017.7799999999997s)]
*  doctor under 40. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4024.5s)]
*  They've been indoctrinated. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4025.5s)]
*  Some of these guys are still wearing masks for Pete's sakes. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4026.5s)]
*  Masks? [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4031.14s)]
*  Oh yeah, there's some physicians that still mask, you know, patients and things like that. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4032.14s)]
*  It's just crazy. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4035.38s)]
*  There's crazy stuff out there Tucker. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4036.5s)]
*  So if you're a doctor, I mean, and you're openly mentally ill like that, why doesn't [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4037.5s)]
*  anybody? [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4041.8199999999997s)]
*  No, I don't mean that as an attack. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4043.3s)]
*  I'm saying that with sympathy, but if you have... [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4045.9s)]
*  It's a great question. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4047.82s)]
*  Why doesn't anyone in the physician's group or the hospital say something? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4049.38s)]
*  Well first off, there's too few doctors. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4054.1000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there's so few that, you know, a lot of these guys, guys, you know, men, women, [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4056.2200000000003s)]
*  whatever, a lot of doctors are there because there's just not enough doctors. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4061.6200000000003s)]
*  I mean, try to, if you try to get a doctor recently and make an appointment, just a routine [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4066.1000000000004s)]
*  appointment, you're talking months down the road. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4070.58s)]
*  You need something more urgently? [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4073.66s)]
*  Good luck with that. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4075.42s)]
*  You know, you'll probably end up going to an energy care center where you'll see a nurse [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4076.42s)]
*  practitioner or PA or someone that's got a fraction of the education experience of a [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4079.42s)]
*  physician. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4084.54s)]
*  So it's not a real, there's not a simple cure for all of this. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4086.7s)]
*  One thing I wanted to try to do with this conversation is not just simply bad mouth, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4095.1s)]
*  you know, my organization, the ACS or bad mouth medicine and surgery because I'm devastated [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4101.98s)]
*  by what's happened. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4109.14s)]
*  I really want, I want surgery to be elevated to where it should be, which is a very highly [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4110.14s)]
*  regarded profession that is dedicated itself to taking care of all comers regardless. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4116.34s)]
*  We don't, you know, we don't judge on who or what you are when you're in front of us [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4123.26s)]
*  and you've got a problem that we're trained to fix. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4127.9400000000005s)]
*  So my solutions, you know, my first solution obviously is to get DEI out of medicine. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4130.9400000000005s)]
*  Politics and ideology do not belong in medicine. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4136.9800000000005s)]
*  I mean, the idea that you can take care of a patient if your first priority is to judge [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4139.3s)]
*  and base them, their color ethnicity is countered everything that Hippocratic medicine is all [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4149.46s)]
*  about. [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4156.02s)]
*  The other is to reinstall standards of excellence. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4157.3s)]
*  We have to quit lowering the bar. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4159.3s)]
*  We got to start elevating the bar again and requiring that, you know, doctors and prospective [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4161.62s)]
*  doctors meet, you know, minimum standards. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4169.26s)]
*  You know, there have to be some minimum, but they have to be higher than the lower 5% for [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4171.02s)]
*  Pete's sakes. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4175.18s)]
*  They can't be that. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4176.18s)]
*  You have to free, you know, the doctors in training to do what they have to do. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4177.18s)]
*  You can't have restricted hours when you've got such limited time anyway. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4182.46s)]
*  In the overall, you know, course of a person's lifetime, you know, three, four, five years [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4189.3s)]
*  in surgery is a drop in the bucket. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4195.3s)]
*  I mean, to ask a surgeon to devote themselves to learning the craft and what they call the [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4197.38s)]
*  art and the science of surgery, you know, not only do you need the time, you need the [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4204.26s)]
*  person to apply themselves. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4209.3s)]
*  One thing I heard, which again is kind of disturbing is that a lot of young surgeons [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4211.820000000001s)]
*  are more concerned about comfort, you know, work-life balance as it's often called, as [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4217.780000000001s)]
*  opposed to learning to be the best doctor they can be. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4224.18s)]
*  They want to know how much time off they have. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4227.42s)]
*  They're very jealous of their time off. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4229.5s)]
*  You know, five o'clock rolls around, they're done. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4231.820000000001s)]
*  They check out and they move out. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4233.78s)]
*  One thing that they found in asking all the program directors about the surgeons coming [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4236.54s)]
*  in to their fellowships was that a large proportion did not have ownership of their patients. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4242.42s)]
*  And ownership means that, you know, you take that patient as your patient. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4248.3s)]
*  That's not just someone that you take care of for a 12-hour shift and then you turn them [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4252.099999999999s)]
*  over to the next person and then, you know, you may not ever see that patient again or [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4255.94s)]
*  not until, you know, two or three shifts later. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4259.78s)]
*  You know, so a lot of young doctors don't have ownership for their patients. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4262.5s)]
*  I'm hearing that from colleagues. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4265.9s)]
*  So how do you treat a rental car? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4267.7s)]
*  Do you ever change the wheel in it? [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4268.82s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4270.299999999999s)]
*  I don't rotate the tires. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4272.299999999999s)]
*  I don't tune it up. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4273.299999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4274.299999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4275.299999999999s)]
*  Well, you've certainly wrecked my day, doctor, but I appreciate your doing this, taking all [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4276.299999999999s)]
*  the time to explain this. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4280.46s)]
*  We still have a good medical system. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4281.82s)]
*  It's probably still, in many respects, the best in the world. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4283.98s)]
*  I have to believe that, but it's in disarray and it's definitely, I believe, in decline. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4287.06s)]
*  And I believe that it's going to take some effort, some will from people that are willing [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4294.700000000001s)]
*  to make those difficult changes. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4300.06s)]
*  Well, thank you for your bravery. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4303.14s)]
*  I don't consider myself brave, but I appreciate that. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4306.780000000001s)]
*  Appreciate the thought. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4309.740000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4310.740000000001s)]
*  Well, nobody else is. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4311.740000000001s)]
*  Thank you enough for giving me a pedestal in which to speak. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4313.42s)]
*  Yeah, I had an emergency appendectomy once by Dr. Leon Pachter. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4317.139999999999s)]
*  It was an amazing surgeon and it saved me. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4321.3s)]
*  And I think most people have had an experience like that and it's important that you're [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4325.9s)]
*  sure to be qualified. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4330.179999999999s)]
*  Holding with an interesting little factoid. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4331.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4332.179999999999s)]
*  Ibram Kendi, the author of Anti-Racism. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4333.179999999999s)]
*  Not a surgeon. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4334.98s)]
*  Not a surgeon. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4335.98s)]
*  He's an author of Anti-Racism. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4336.98s)]
*  A moron. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4337.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4338.98s)]
*  He had colon cancer. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4339.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4340.98s)]
*  He was the most competent. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4342.219999999999s)]
*  He was the most reputed reporter that he went to. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4343.219999999999s)]
*  He interviewed several surgeons, black surgeons, showed the white surgeon for his surgery. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4344.219999999999s)]
*  He was the most competent. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4348.259999999999s)]
*  Shouldn't be allowed. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4349.62s)]
*  Nope. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4351.62s)]
*  You get the surgeon from Burkina Faso. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4352.98s)]
*  Abram Kendi. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4355.139999999999s)]
*  That's my opinion. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4356.139999999999s)]
*  Thank you, doctor. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4357.139999999999s)]
*  But I'm obviously a vindictive bad person. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4358.139999999999s)]
*  So thanks. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4361.139999999999s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4362.139999999999s)]

*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4364.3s)]
*  On one level, that's not surprising. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4371.860000000001s)]
*  That's what they do. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4373.54s)]
*  But on another level, it's shocking. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4374.54s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, all the change taking place in [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4375.9800000000005s)]
*  our economy and our politics with the wars, one the cusp of fighting right now, Google [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4379.34s)]
*  has decided you should have less information rather than more. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4384.660000000001s)]
*  That is totally wrong. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4388.9800000000005s)]
*  It's immoral. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4390.9400000000005s)]
*  What can you do about it? [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4392.3s)]
*  We could whine about it. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4394.26s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4395.26s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4396.26s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4397.26s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally deceptive. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4398.62s)]
*  The way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4403.66s)]
*  Subscribe. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4407.54s)]
*  Hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4408.54s)]
*  That way you'll have a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4412.7s)]
*  So we hope that you'll do that. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpCRRoibwV0&t=4417.82s)]
