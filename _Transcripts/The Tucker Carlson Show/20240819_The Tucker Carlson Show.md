# Vince Coglianese Free Vasectomies at the DNC, Don Lemon’s Arrogance, and the Humiliation of Biden
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [August 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w)
*  The Democratic National Convention starts this week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=0.0s)]
*  Appalling, but there are thankfully entertainment possibilities and we think we've found them. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3.04s)]
*  So for the first time in a long time, we are going live this Thursday night, 830 Eastern. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8.96s)]
*  We're going to be doing a live stream to react to Carmella Harris' primetime speech. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=14.24s)]
*  Great Jason Whitlock will join us in studio. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  This will be airing on TCN only. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=23.46s)]
*  We recommend it strongly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=26.46s)]
*  To see the whole thing live Thursday night, 830. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=27.62s)]
*  In the meantime, here's our latest episode on the DNC with Vince Colonais. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=32.620000000000005s)]
*  So someone just sent me a video of the protesters outside the DNC. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=57.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  So I guess almost by definition, even crazier than the people inside the DNC. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  And the first thing you notice is they're all wearing masks outside. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=68.62s)]
*  And I don't want to be mean, mental illness is real. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=73.62s)]
*  They're obviously mentally ill. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=76.62s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=77.62s)]
*  But what's so interesting is I never see that in my life. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=78.62s)]
*  Do you ever see anybody wearing masks outside? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=81.62s)]
*  Well, I live near Washington, so yes. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=84.62s)]
*  You actually do now? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=86.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=87.78s)]
*  So there are categories of people, I think, who are just neurotic and who've been misled, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=88.78s)]
*  especially by the left. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=92.78s)]
*  And they wear the masks still up until this very day. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=94.78s)]
*  Do you know how bad that is for your health? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=96.78s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=98.78s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=99.78s)]
*  I'd rather smoke cigarettes any day. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=100.78s)]
*  I actually think the cost to socialization is even worse. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=102.78s)]
*  It's like your health is awful, but like, what does that say about you and how isolated [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=105.78s)]
*  you are from the rest of society? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=108.78s)]
*  That can't be good for your head. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=110.78s)]
*  And the truth is, I think, I don't think it's for like a lot of these people. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=112.94s)]
*  I don't really think in the end it's really about the health. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=116.62s)]
*  They maybe soothe themselves by saying that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=118.78s)]
*  Fundamentally, it's a political gesture. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=121.42s)]
*  I'm a part of a club. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=124.1s)]
*  It's a uniform. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=125.3s)]
*  It's signaling you're with the left. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=126.5s)]
*  And they're still doing it to this day. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=127.98s)]
*  It's like crazy. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=129.58s)]
*  I think I'm just too out of it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=130.7s)]
*  I mean, because I see that and I'm like, okay, especially if it's a man, you're totally emasculated [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=132.18s)]
*  and pathetic. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=137.4s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=138.4s)]
*  You have no self-respect at all. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=139.4s)]
*  You hate yourself and for good reason. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=140.4s)]
*  That's the first thing I think. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=142.42s)]
*  With contempt, but also pity, like I just can't, you actually see people with masks outside. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=143.78s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=149.22s)]
*  And I do think like the people that you're talking about outside the convention, that's [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=151.42s)]
*  also a means to commit a crime and get away with it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=157.5s)]
*  Well, that's right. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  That's really, so a lot of states in our country, I don't know if it's all the states, but a [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  lot of them have anti-masking laws on the books. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=164.06s)]
*  And the concept is that you shouldn't- [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=167.1s)]
*  Going back to the 1920s. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=168.57999999999998s)]
*  Like a bandit, like be able to just rob a store with a handkerchief tied around your [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=170.06s)]
*  face. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  So they have anti-masking laws, which I think are still on the books and no one's ever gotten [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=174.98000000000002s)]
*  rid of them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=178.98000000000002s)]
*  Those were anti-clan laws, I think in most places. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, that would be a useful law in order to prevent that activity. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=182.46s)]
*  So anyway, but these guys and they commit crimes and it's the same, it's the true about [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=186.14000000000001s)]
*  Antifa. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=192.06s)]
*  How often did we see a riot committed by Antifa where they destroyed things, where [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=193.06s)]
*  they killed people, where they burned, they burned down the third precinct in Minneapolis, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=197.3s)]
*  all of the chaos and they're wearing masks in order to prevent people from knowing who [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=201.94s)]
*  they are so that they can be held accountable. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=206.46s)]
*  And we accept it because the left says, well, mask wearing is necessary. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=208.78s)]
*  I don't want to digress too much, which is a problem that I have, but did the FBI ever, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=213.22s)]
*  I mean, I know we spent a lot of time tracing the roots of Christian nationalism and like [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=218.38000000000002s)]
*  grandmothers are still in jail from January 6th, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=223.62s)]
*  But did anybody in law enforcement ever get to the bottom of Antifa? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=227.62s)]
*  No, no. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=232.3s)]
*  And they've shown almost no interest in it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=233.88s)]
*  In Antifa. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=235.5s)]
*  In fact, you remember when- [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=236.5s)]
*  You came to my house and threatened my wife, vandalized my house, killed a bunch of people [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=237.5s)]
*  around the country and were just totally ignored. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  I remember really clearly. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=244.34s)]
*  Did the cops ever follow up with you after your house was attacked? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=245.34s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=248.38s)]
*  Anyone ever get answers? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=249.38s)]
*  I don't want to make it about me or whine about it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=250.38s)]
*  It's not about me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=251.38s)]
*  If you would think as a victim of it, as your wife being a victim of it, then maybe you'd [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=253.14s)]
*  be given a readout on what happened. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=257.58s)]
*  No, nobody cared. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=259.34s)]
*  And the cops did come to my house months later. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=260.54s)]
*  In fact, two black cops, both of whom told me they were voting for Trump in DC, great [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=267.18s)]
*  guys, came to my house and told me to carry a gun when I went outside. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=275.5s)]
*  The cops told you, you're on your own. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=280.72s)]
*  That's what they- [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=282.72s)]
*  They didn't say you're on your own. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=283.72s)]
*  They said, we recommend that you carry a gun. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=284.72s)]
*  Yeah, but that is the message of that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=285.72s)]
*  Which I did, of course. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=286.72s)]
*  They were actually great, but no, but there was no effort to kind of find out who did [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  this. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=295.04s)]
*  But it's just interesting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=296.04s)]
*  Again, I don't want to make it about me because it's not, but I just think it's remarkable [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=297.04s)]
*  that you could have this armed militia in the streets that still exists and nobody at [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=300.92s)]
*  the FBI. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=307.8s)]
*  They really are criminals, the people who run the FBI, if I can just say. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=309.88s)]
*  Chris Ray's a freaking criminal. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=312.16s)]
*  I'm trying not to use the F word, but they don't get to the bottom of it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=313.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=316.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, just ask the crisis pregnancy centers around the country. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  So all the pro-life pregnancy centers, the ones who actually help mothers, who actually [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  provide diapers and formula and who work with them in the early stages of your child's life. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=325.36s)]
*  Adoption. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=330.76s)]
*  Yeah, adoption. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=331.76s)]
*  Like angels on earth. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=332.76s)]
*  Every single person I've interviewed who works with or for a crisis pregnancy center is, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=334.52s)]
*  first of all, a lot better person than I am. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=338.6s)]
*  And you can feel the spirituality come off of them. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=341.6s)]
*  The goodness, the innate goodness come off of them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  And all of the crimes against those places, they don't get solved. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  In fact, they don't even get looked into in any meaningful way. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  And that includes firebombing, that includes vandalism, smashing windows, attacking these [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=355.36s)]
*  facilities. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=360.76000000000005s)]
*  Meanwhile, if you're singing church hymns outside of an abortion mill, your life will [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=361.76000000000005s)]
*  be destroyed. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=366.04s)]
*  And when Merrick Garland, the attorney general, was asked about this in Congress, like, hey, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=367.48s)]
*  crisis pregnancy centers being destroyed, old ladies singing outside of abortion mills. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=371.96000000000004s)]
*  He said, well, he didn't say the old lady, but the old lady, her face is out and it's [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=377.12s)]
*  in daylight so we can catch her. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=382.56s)]
*  But the Antifa people, they do it at night. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=384.56s)]
*  So Speaker Mike Johnson, who's constantly telling you what a great Christian he is, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=388.20000000000005s)]
*  who's constantly telling you what a great Christian he is, sort of led the effort to [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=393.0s)]
*  refund the FBI and build them a new headquarters and has done nothing. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=398.8s)]
*  I mean, the FBI is now a kind of anti-Christian secret police force. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=403.0s)]
*  And the purportedly Christian Speaker of the House just sort of rubber stamps their funding [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=412.16s)]
*  every year and nobody does anything about this. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=416.5s)]
*  I mean, you can feel the frustration in my voice, I think. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=418.64s)]
*  It's totally despicable. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=422.0s)]
*  And I hate dwelling on that. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=423.88s)]
*  I do too. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=425.76s)]
*  Because what it starts to do is it creeps into your mind, but none of it matters. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=426.76s)]
*  Like you start becoming so fatalist about it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=430.36s)]
*  No, it's so true. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=432.56s)]
*  It's like, I don't care. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=433.56s)]
*  Whatever the outcome is, it's all going south. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=434.76s)]
*  It's totally right. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=436.88s)]
*  And I don't want to be tempted by that thought. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=437.88s)]
*  Like I really don't. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=439.76s)]
*  That's deep. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=440.92s)]
*  Actually. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=441.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=442.92s)]
*  But it- [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=443.92s)]
*  Not that I have any idea what you're talking about, Vince. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=444.92s)]
*  It drives me so crazy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=445.92s)]
*  No, I know. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=446.92s)]
*  Which is why. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=447.92s)]
*  So do you think Trump learned enough lessons from round one in order to do it differently [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=449.16s)]
*  in round two? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=453.96000000000004s)]
*  I can't answer that question. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=455.08000000000004s)]
*  You can't because you have no idea. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=457.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't want to. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=459.12s)]
*  You don't want to. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=460.12s)]
*  You know, you hope so. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=461.12s)]
*  I mean, I think like a lot of people- Why am I talking? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=462.32s)]
*  I'm here to interview you. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=465.96000000000004s)]
*  But since you asked, I think like a lot of people- Well, first of all, I really like [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=467.28000000000003s)]
*  Trump enormously as a person. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=471.48s)]
*  A. B, I think that the alternative is so shocking that I've kind of put on pause all thoughts [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=475.56s)]
*  like the one you just raised. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=483.6s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  Because it's super clear what's going to happen if the Democratic Party holds power. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=487.15999999999997s)]
*  It's not about Kamala Harris. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=491.8s)]
*  She's not even- I don't think there's any evidence she's like an actual person. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=492.8s)]
*  No. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=496.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=497.04s)]
*  So it's about the party. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=498.04s)]
*  It's about the collective. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=499.04s)]
*  the people who really have wrecked the country, continuing to loot it and to destroy the First [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=500.6s)]
*  and Second Amendments, the Bill of Rights, civil liberties in the United States for another [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=507.06s)]
*  four years, which will really be kind of the end and then just a one party state. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=511.32s)]
*  That's what I foresee. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=515.04s)]
*  And that's just so bad that I'm not spending a ton of time thinking about the question [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=516.88s)]
*  that you just raised. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=522.76s)]
*  But, you know, I hope so for sure. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=523.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=525.32s)]
*  But the- I mean, first of all, the chances of both of these scenarios are very high. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=526.32s)]
*  Like one where Kamala wins and we head for what you think is the end. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=529.76s)]
*  Do you- is it that dark for you? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=534.48s)]
*  Do you think- [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=537.12s)]
*  Well, I have no idea. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=538.12s)]
*  My ability to foresee the future is like non-existent. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=539.12s)]
*  Every political call I've ever made is wrong. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=542.16s)]
*  You know, so- [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=544.0s)]
*  And that's true, by the way, of almost like literally everybody in politics. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=545.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=547.0s)]
*  And I also think just judging from my own brief and not very exciting life, but one [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=548.0s)]
*  takeaway from it though, after 55 years is your victories turn out very often to be your [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=552.96s)]
*  losses and your losses almost always turn out to be your victories. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=557.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=561.1199999999999s)]
*  And we don't see that as people. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=562.1199999999999s)]
*  It's a consistent theme throughout history, throughout the Old and New Testaments. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=564.2399999999999s)]
*  It's like just when you think everything is lost, that is- I mean, well, that actually, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=569.2399999999999s)]
*  that's the theme of Christianity out of, you know, being tortured to death. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=572.8s)]
*  Don't you feel like- [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=575.76s)]
*  The world is saved, so- [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=576.76s)]
*  Don't you feel like that that happened in 2020? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=577.76s)]
*  So in a sense, the losses of 2020 have definitely hardened like the world of normal people to [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=580.96s)]
*  the point that like they're not playing games anymore. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=588.08s)]
*  They're not dressing up their language. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=591.08s)]
*  They're being very clear about their thinking. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=592.7800000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=594.48s)]
*  They know where all of this is going. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=595.48s)]
*  They're not trying to suck up to everybody else. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=596.48s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=598.24s)]
*  I mean, like, look, if we had to do 2020 over again, I don't want the outcome that we got, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=599.44s)]
*  but I will say it's made a lot of people better. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=604.72s)]
*  And in fact, you and I have talked about this. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  It's made a lot of people better. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=607.72s)]
*  That is absolutely right. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=608.72s)]
*  The spiritual component, the religious component in the country took off in a way that I couldn't [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=610.36s)]
*  have foreseen- [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=615.0s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=616.0s)]
*  In 2020, don't you think? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=617.0s)]
*  I felt it coming. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=618.0s)]
*  I don't know why, but I actually have not been surprised by it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=622.88s)]
*  I've been delighted to see it, but not surprised. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=626.72s)]
*  But I do think that people I know and really blessed to know are all deeper and smarter [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=629.6800000000001s)]
*  and warmer with each other, more real with each other, more I love yous, more honesty. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=638.6s)]
*  More intentional. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=645.76s)]
*  Way more. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=646.76s)]
*  So I just know for my own family, and I'm not talking about material prosperity, I just [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=647.76s)]
*  mean I'm speaking only in terms of love, is so much stronger and happier after COVID, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=652.6s)]
*  after the BLM riots, after all the sadness we've seen, after the clearly stolen election. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=660.6s)]
*  All these bad things happen, but people I know love each other more. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=666.44s)]
*  So yeah, I'm not going to even guess. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=671.6s)]
*  I shouldn't even have said all that about the Democratic Party because I don't know [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=675.2s)]
*  what's going to happen. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=679.32s)]
*  Well, I guess if you take the long view, which as a Christian you should, if you take the [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=680.32s)]
*  long view, in the end, you're not really all that disturbed by the pace of this. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=685.44s)]
*  You're disturbed on behalf of your family, of course. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  You care about your country, but you have this eternal optimism that, well, the Bible [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=691.94s)]
*  does kind of lay out the misery that precedes glory. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=696.5s)]
*  Well that's exactly right. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=700.5s)]
*  And so in the end, you always wonder at what stage in history are we living through? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=701.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=706.5799999999999s)]
*  So I think you have an advantage because you're 15 years younger than me-ish. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=708.18s)]
*  Something like that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=713.14s)]
*  Something like that, maybe more. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=714.14s)]
*  But I was born in 69, and so from 69 to 2016, my core assumption was everything's great [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=715.14s)]
*  and everything's going to get better every year and bad things don't happen. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=726.02s)]
*  Our system is totally solid. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=729.02s)]
*  And there are, of course, bad actors within the system, but they don't control the system. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=731.54s)]
*  The system is fundamentally real. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=735.9s)]
*  It is a democracy in some loose sense. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=737.26s)]
*  The people do have a say in how they're governed, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=739.94s)]
*  9-11 is real. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=745.46s)]
*  I mean, whatever. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=746.46s)]
*  I just kind of believed everything. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=747.46s)]
*  But the lesson of history is there's always turmoil and a lot of things are always going [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=751.1800000000001s)]
*  to be fake. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=755.5s)]
*  And the Lord of the Earth is Satan. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=757.58s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of right. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=760.98s)]
*  So it's just like, this is what it is. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=762.54s)]
*  It's what it's always been. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=764.62s)]
*  I just think people who are your age are less shocked by that than I am. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=766.46s)]
*  My main impediment is just being shocked. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=772.3s)]
*  Like, I can't believe this is happening. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=773.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's true. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=774.9s)]
*  What? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=775.9s)]
*  They're putting people in prison for praying at abortion clinics? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=776.9s)]
*  Like what? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=778.94s)]
*  They replaced Easter with trans visibility day? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=779.94s)]
*  I can't believe this. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=781.86s)]
*  Which is kind of like, I'm not a boomer, but it is kind of, thankfully I'm not a boomer, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=783.22s)]
*  but it's kind of a boomer response. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=788.78s)]
*  The opening ceremonies to the Olympics. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=791.0600000000001s)]
*  The fact that they would do a fake Last Supper with all trans people or drag people, it's [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=793.46s)]
*  like, does it get any more brazen? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=798.1s)]
*  And they're like, oh, it's totally normal. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=803.46s)]
*  Like, what are you all complaining about? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=804.94s)]
*  What? [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=806.9s)]
*  I mean, it is, they double barrel middle finger every Christian on earth. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=807.9s)]
*  Of course, because Christianity is the enemy. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=812.06s)]
*  That's what they hate. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=814.2199999999999s)]
*  That's what they actually hate. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=815.2199999999999s)]

*  Period. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=825.5799999999999s)]
*  That's their goal. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=826.5799999999999s)]
*  Whether they know it or not, but don't listen to what they say. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=827.5799999999999s)]
*  Watch what they do. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=830.38s)]
*  For sure. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=831.38s)]
*  So what, okay. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=832.38s)]
*  Tell me what to make of speaking of spiritual themes in our politics. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=833.8599999999999s)]
*  The abortion lobby shows up at the DNC this week and sends with them a mobile vasectomy [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=839.14s)]
*  clinic. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=850.18s)]
*  So you can get snipped if you want at the DNC, this at a time where the birth rate among [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=852.06s)]
*  native board Americans is like not way below replacement. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=857.58s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=860.6999999999999s)]
*  Not having babies. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=861.6999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=862.6999999999999s)]
*  Why would that be your priority? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=863.7s)]
*  It's a death call. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=865.34s)]
*  It's a total death call. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=867.02s)]
*  I mean, every look at the bottom of every one of these policies that they pitch and [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=868.1s)]
*  they sell you as like a good thing is human suffering at the bottom of all of them. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=872.54s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=876.74s)]
*  So a really good example of this is the climate stuff. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=877.74s)]
*  So let's assume for a moment that all of their climate catastrophizing is correct. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=879.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=883.02s)]
*  That that's our activity. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=884.02s)]
*  That's making the earth warmer. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=885.02s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=886.26s)]
*  Well, it turns out that the warmer the planet is, the better it is for humans. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=887.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=892.06s)]
*  More humans survive in an environment where the earth is warmer. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=893.06s)]
*  In fact, when the earth is colder, lots of people die. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=895.82s)]
*  Lots of people die. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=899.46s)]
*  And so there's no actually no there's no challenge to that science whatsoever. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=900.46s)]
*  It's totally clear. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=904.74s)]
*  You know, if it's a matter of like sea level rise, all this other stuff, we have like amazing [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=905.74s)]
*  alert systems, hurricanes. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=909.72s)]
*  The reason people don't die to hurricanes is because we have we have such a far out [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=911.0200000000001s)]
*  advanced notice that they're coming. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=913.9000000000001s)]
*  Our buildings are so much more durable. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=916.34s)]
*  They never talk about death counts, by the way, when they talk about hurricanes and what [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=917.94s)]
*  they're doing in the climate change. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=921.3800000000001s)]
*  Way fewer people die due to hurricanes now. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=922.6600000000001s)]
*  It's never at its core about human flourishing ever. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=925.02s)]
*  So if it's not about human flourishing, it's about the opposite. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=929.64s)]
*  It's about death. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=931.98s)]
*  It's totally fine with it. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=933.06s)]
*  In fact, they view us as a cancer on the earth, at least the radical left's so-called environmental [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=934.46s)]
*  movement and the abortion thing. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=939.66s)]
*  It is it is it's a death cult. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=942.6999999999999s)]
*  All sort of like pagan tribal religions have had death rituals. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=945.98s)]
*  Of course, human sacrifice is the one constant. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=951.5799999999999s)]
*  On my radio show, I refer to this as human sacrifice all the time because that's what [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=954.7s)]
*  it is. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=957.74s)]
*  And it's so it's breaking yourself of the spell of using their terminology is such a [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=958.74s)]
*  challenging thing to do because it's like everywhere it surrounds you. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=964.22s)]
*  It's like every newspaper you read, every television show you watch, every social media [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=967.66s)]
*  post you consume, lots of them in the past. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=972.18s)]
*  They use like the language of the left as it's shifting, as it's modifying. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=974.62s)]
*  And if you don't use the language, you're censored. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=978.7s)]
*  So it's mind control, as you know. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=980.86s)]
*  And so the obsession with death and advancing it as a social good is one of the most destructive [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=983.48s)]
*  things that any culture can do. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=990.28s)]
*  And we're living through it. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=993.04s)]
*  I mean, this abortion fetish is out of control. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=994.04s)]
*  And you know, what's even crazier is that the Kamala campaign, to the extent that one [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=997.2s)]
*  exists that that has a policy agenda, that's their thing. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1001.96s)]
*  They think that's their number one issue is abortion. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1006.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1008.6800000000001s)]
*  And they think that she's a great pitch woman for it. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1009.6800000000001s)]
*  She's so good at abortion. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1011.6800000000001s)]
*  So how many abortions would equal freedom and happiness? [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1013.3599999999999s)]
*  We don't have enough abortions? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1016.9599999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1018.76s)]
*  But is there, can they, I mean, I always feel like in politics, you know, effective politicians [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1019.76s)]
*  describe the future, they will bring you a few vote for them. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1025.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1028.84s)]
*  Vote for me and you get whatever, a new car. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1029.84s)]
*  Fine. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  I get that. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1033.1599999999999s)]
*  But when you run on abortion, it's like we have a lot of hundreds of thousands of abortions [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1035.52s)]
*  every year, hundreds and hundreds of thousands of abortions every year. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1039.2s)]
*  So how many more until we're happy? [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1042.68s)]
*  I mean, some years we've had, I think in the vicinity of a million abortions a year, which [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1046.48s)]
*  for those people who pay attention to immigration, that's about the number of legal immigrants [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1052.2s)]
*  we bring into the country every year. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1056.2s)]
*  So we're aborting a million Americans and then importing a million workers each year, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1058.26s)]
*  give or take. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1064.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1065.8s)]
*  That number changes. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1066.8s)]
*  And it's super disheartening because it's like, first of all, you're killing off the [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1067.8s)]
*  next generation of the people who have a vested interest in this country and then you're importing [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1070.76s)]
*  people who don't at all. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1075.52s)]
*  No tie to its history at all or to its systems or to its creed. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1079.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1083.88s)]
*  It's not, I mean- [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1084.88s)]
*  To its culture, to its language. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1085.88s)]
*  They're not even bothering themselves with that question. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1086.88s)]
*  It's like a sensible immigration system would actually be predicated on those questions. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1088.64s)]
*  What can you contribute? [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1092.84s)]
*  How much do you adhere? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1093.84s)]
*  Are you going to assimilate? [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1094.84s)]
*  Are you going to buy into our culture and creed? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1095.84s)]
*  Those are the core questions of how you compose a country and allow immigration at the same [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1097.8s)]
*  time. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1101.76s)]
*  They're not even, they're aligning those. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1102.9199999999998s)]
*  Who cares? [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1105.12s)]

*  Or they'll say, oh, it only happens in very rare, very rare circumstances with the life [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1334.1599999999999s)]

*  Nobody knows this because the media doesn't tell you that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1361.5s)]
*  It oftentimes involves like women who either didn't know they were pregnant until, which [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1364.6200000000001s)]
*  suggests that they probably weren't all that healthy, like physically healthy. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1368.78s)]
*  Or it's women who did their own question on whether or not they would get the abortion [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1374.02s)]
*  at all. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1378.46s)]
*  They eventually in a very late stage decided to do it. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1379.46s)]

*  deeply misogynist institution. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1394.1799999999998s)]

*  Yeah. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1401.26s)]

*  I worked in a business that was mostly women. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1416.5s)]

*  They're less distracted. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1420.86s)]
*  They're more task oriented. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1421.86s)]
*  And they actually do what they say they're going to do. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1423.86s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1426.1s)]
*  They don't space out and try to improvise midway through or get high in the men's room [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1427.1s)]
*  and forget. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1430.1s)]

*  And I love working with women. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1446.86s)]

*  not to have kids because they get in that kids are a higher priority than your whatever [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1455.3799999999999s)]
*  stupid job you're offering them. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1459.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1461.26s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1462.26s)]
*  100%. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1463.26s)]
*  The labor market pushes this shit, this anti-fertility stuff on women, tells them it's liberation. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1464.34s)]
*  And I'm sorry to say this, but a lot of them like don't think it through. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1471.66s)]
*  And they're like, it's liberation. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1474.78s)]
*  It's sad. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1477.22s)]
*  And that's how you wind up with this. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1478.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1481.22s)]
*  There's a group, I think it's based in DC. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1482.22s)]
*  It's capitalism, Vince. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1484.94s)]
*  We have to support it or else we're against free markets. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1485.94s)]
*  There's a left-wing group in DC that's dedicated to this issue, what you're talking about. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1489.42s)]
*  Really? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1493.5800000000002s)]
*  Well, I support them because I agree with that. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1494.5800000000002s)]
*  I think there's PPAU, I think it's like a progressive anti-abortion union or something. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1495.5800000000002s)]
*  And at its core is exactly the argument you're making, which is like, why are we telling [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1501.02s)]
*  women to be wage slaves? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1505.42s)]
*  Like why are we telling them that their most important purpose is corporate America? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1507.54s)]
*  To work at a bank. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1511.9s)]
*  All the way through their ability. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1512.9s)]
*  You were born to work at a bank. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1514.26s)]
*  Like, imagine if you had a window of time where you could perform magic in your life. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1517.3000000000002s)]
*  And the magic could only be performed during this like 20-year window of time. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1523.06s)]
*  And some company hired you and said, we'll hire you under this condition. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1526.7s)]
*  You never use your magic. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1529.46s)]
*  Never once will you be able to use this magic ability that you'll never be able to do again. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1532.06s)]
*  You can never use it during the time that you work for us. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1536.46s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1538.66s)]
*  In fact, we'll pay for you not to do it. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1539.66s)]
*  Which is what they do. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1541.6200000000001s)]
*  They do this to women. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1542.6200000000001s)]
*  And they have this incredible magic, miraculous ability. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1543.6200000000001s)]
*  We have huge sectors of our society dedicated to telling them, don't use it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1548.8200000000002s)]
*  Don't you dare. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1553.78s)]
*  You can create life or you can create a spreadsheet. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1556.5400000000002s)]
*  And we think the spreadsheet's more important. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1561.5400000000002s)]
*  Or you can create value for our stock. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1563.26s)]
*  What would you like to do? [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1565.26s)]
*  It's so unbelievable. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1567.1000000000001s)]
*  And what's interesting is I'm now, I'm sorry, I keep attacking Republicans. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1569.8200000000002s)]
*  I plan to vote for them, just to be clear. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1574.22s)]
*  Don't have an option. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1576.6000000000001s)]
*  But the number of Republicans who are sort of leaders, I'm talking about, not the voters, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1578.02s)]
*  by and large, but they're leaders, like totally buy into that. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1582.62s)]
*  And they're like, I wish these pro-family, anti-abortion people, Christians would just [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1585.66s)]
*  shut up. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1590.1399999999999s)]
*  Just shut up. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1591.54s)]
*  Like how does that help private equity or war against Iran? [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1592.54s)]
*  No. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1595.06s)]
*  Do you know what I mean? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1596.06s)]
*  Like they totally agree with the left on these issues. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1597.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1601.1399999999999s)]
*  Because... [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1602.1399999999999s)]
*  And they'll call you a socialist if you disagree. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1603.1399999999999s)]
*  I think part of it is like they're too lazy to take the mental inventory necessary to [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1604.1399999999999s)]
*  make the arguments. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1607.54s)]
*  I think that's part of it, honestly. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1608.54s)]
*  Having met, I mean, you've met way more of these guys than I have, but I've met a lot [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1610.62s)]
*  of them. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1613.74s)]
*  Oh, they're so disgusting. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1614.74s)]
*  And if it's not an issue that's like in the headlines right now, there's not a lot of [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1615.86s)]
*  deep thoughts on the subject. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1620.46s)]
*  No. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1621.46s)]
*  You know, like there's not a lot of like existential thinking going on. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1622.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1625.98s)]
*  Which is unfortunate. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1626.98s)]
*  It's really unfortunate because the right, the normal American, which I love using, by [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1627.98s)]
*  the way, I just like, I think the phrase normal is like the best way to attack. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1634.1s)]
*  Because it really does reflect like what we are all thinking fundamentally, right and [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1637.26s)]
*  left. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1641.18s)]
*  Normal people like babies, right? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1642.18s)]
*  Normal people like flourishing families. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1644.9s)]
*  Normal people recognize the value that it's given to them and they feel awful for the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1646.66s)]
*  people who've been sold the lies. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1650.46s)]
*  And so we should just speak up for it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1652.52s)]
*  And you should, if you're a conservative politician, Republican politician, and you don't have [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1654.42s)]
*  a good argument against the death cult, one, you shouldn't be a politician. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1658.26s)]
*  You should get out of the game entirely. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1662.7800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1663.7800000000002s)]
*  Like at least like sit down. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1664.78s)]
*  Maybe have a wife, sit down with her and talk about it and like come up with some clear [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  answers and then fight for what's right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1670.18s)]
*  And then fight to create a world where people don't feel like they need to kill a baby in [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1672.34s)]
*  order to thrive. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1676.3799999999999s)]
*  You know? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1677.3799999999999s)]
*  I would like to see, I mean, maybe I'm getting less, I don't know, laissez faire as I get [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1678.3799999999999s)]
*  older, but if you see the energy that went in to destroying the lives of all those middle-aged, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1683.7s)]
*  diabetic, lower middle-class white Americans who went to defend the constitution on January [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1690.42s)]
*  6th, like really we harnessed the entire machine to crush them. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1697.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1703.22s)]
*  As long as that machine exists, why not turn it on any company that encourages its female [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1704.22s)]
*  employees to quote, freeze their eggs? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1708.78s)]
*  There's something about that. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1712.66s)]
*  Like any company that encourages women to work themselves to death in pursuit of some [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1713.78s)]
*  totally pointless goal, like private equity or banking, and then tells them, but we'll [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1720.1399999999999s)]

*  I mean, it's like, sorry, I know I'm not supposed to say that, but I think that like those are [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1732.46s)]

*  The January 6th thing is like, is the perfect, the perfect understanding, the perfect template [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1748.5s)]
*  for understanding all of this because remember in the wake of January 6th, that Washington [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1754.46s)]
*  Post article about how they were all in debt. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1757.74s)]
*  Oh, I never will forget it. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1760.6599999999999s)]
*  It was the last piece of journalism that paper committed. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1762.78s)]
*  It was like three or four days. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1764.8999999999999s)]
*  It was very close to January 6th. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1765.8999999999999s)]
*  They did like a basic piece of journalism, like who are the people in the crowd? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1768.22s)]
*  And the answer to that question was that they were all in deep financial distress. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1772.98s)]
*  Most of them, not all of them, I guess, but a lot of them. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1776.8600000000001s)]
*  They had bankruptcies and massive amounts of debt and were very, had a lot of financial [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1780.26s)]
*  discontent. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1785.1000000000001s)]
*  And that was the last time I think that that paper treated them as humans. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1786.42s)]
*  But at its core, what that story tells you is that they don't have the financial means [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1790.3s)]
*  to fight back. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1793.94s)]

*  opioids that kill people. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1815.74s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1816.74s)]
*  The Sacklers are still billionaires. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1817.74s)]
*  And then lie to them about that. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1818.74s)]
*  If you're, heck, even Kaleid Sheikh Mohammed was headed towards a settlement until like [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1821.02s)]
*  there was a national uproar about it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1826.4199999999998s)]
*  And that guy, the 9-11 mastermind, how many years out are we from that? [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1828.1799999999998s)]
*  And we have January 6 grandmas who are serving years in prison. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1832.2199999999998s)]
*  The guy with the guy who you interviewed, Jacob Chansley, like years, like the sentences [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1835.8999999999999s)]
*  that these people have been given, lives destroyed. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1841.4199999999998s)]
*  Kaleid Sheikh Mohammed still haven't resolved that, the 9-11 attacks. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1844.6599999999999s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1847.82s)]
*  Have we, so we got Kevin McCarthy, the former kind of mediocre speaker who is now much missed [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1848.94s)]
*  by me, to give up some of the 9-11 footage where I probably got fired. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1857.06s)]
*  But the January 6th? [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1866.02s)]
*  Rather, the January 6th. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1867.5800000000002s)]
*  Did I say 9-11? [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1868.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1869.5800000000002s)]
*  I was like, wow, that's a story. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1870.5800000000002s)]
*  Tell me. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1871.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that is a story. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1872.5800000000002s)]
*  Like why are there any 9-11 documents still classified? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1873.5800000000002s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1876.14s)]
*  Why are there any JFK documents? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1877.3400000000001s)]
*  Well, you know why. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1878.8600000000001s)]
*  To protect people who lied about those events. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1879.8600000000001s)]
*  But anyway, back to January 6th, sorry. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1882.94s)]
*  Why do we have to wait, you know, 61 years to see the rest of the January 6 footage? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1885.14s)]
*  It's been almost four years. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1891.1000000000001s)]
*  So why is the Republican speaker continuing to hold all this footage? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1893.3000000000002s)]
*  Why not make it all public? [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1898.3400000000001s)]
*  Sometimes I think that they get so obsessed with controlling the storylines. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1901.0600000000002s)]
*  They're not even good at it though. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1904.5800000000002s)]
*  But it's like, well, we can't let that become the story because that could be a cost to [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1907.3000000000002s)]
*  us. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1910.0600000000002s)]
*  I'm like, I don't know. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1911.0600000000002s)]
*  What is the evidence that you're great at this? [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1912.0600000000002s)]
*  What evidence exists that demonstrates that you are the person that we should rely on [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1915.22s)]
*  to set the timeline for when the public finds out this stuff? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1919.38s)]
*  That's idiotic. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1922.5s)]
*  And I'd happen to believe that telling the truth is the most important thing. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1924.26s)]
*  Because the more you do that, so long as you actually believe in our system as a place [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1930.02s)]
*  where the voters get to say. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1933.18s)]
*  They have to have that in order to make those decisions. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1935.26s)]
*  Of course. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1937.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1938.5s)]
*  That's the whole ballgame. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1939.5s)]
*  You can't have democracy with censorship, period. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1940.5s)]
*  Can I, can I, I know you don't want me to ask you too many questions, but let me ask [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1942.34s)]
*  you one at least. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1945.22s)]
*  The fact that they replaced Biden made me a little bit hopeful that the election isn't [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1947.14s)]
*  quite as rigged as you might expect. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1952.78s)]
*  In other words, they were so concerned that the voters really would have their say with [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1956.48s)]
*  Biden in office that they replaced him. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1961.56s)]
*  They said, we can't, this is too much. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1964.06s)]
*  And I've talked about this with friends on the right and some of them are under the opinion [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1966.5s)]
*  that, oh no, it was too obvious. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1970.5s)]
*  So if they're going to rig the election, it'd be too obvious because nobody likes Biden [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1972.94s)]
*  and they don't want to give away entirely that it was rigged. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1975.4199999999998s)]
*  That's kind of the, I think the way that they explain this away. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1978.4199999999998s)]
*  I don't think, I think that's, I think that's wrong because the left is completely brazen [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1981.7s)]
*  about their lives. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1985.46s)]
*  I don't think they would pause for a moment to be like, oh no, the public thinks it's [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1986.46s)]
*  rigged because Biden got reelected. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1989.62s)]
*  I actually think that at least at this moment that voters, kind of like the way Trump is [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1991.74s)]
*  saying, if they can make it too big to rig, they really do have a say right now, which [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=1997.3400000000001s)]
*  is why the info war continues. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2002.38s)]
*  Like the battle, as Alex Jones says, but the battle over the voters minds is still so intense. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2004.1000000000001s)]
*  It suggests to me very strongly that the election system really does work at least to an extent. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2011.94s)]
*  But I think that's true in any system. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2019.82s)]
*  I mean, what's so striking to me is how just having traveled a lot and looked at a lot [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2021.8999999999999s)]
*  of different systems around the world is there really are no purely totalitarian countries [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2027.62s)]
*  or systems that never have been. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2033.22s)]
*  I mean, Stalin, who is about as close to an absolute dictator Mao, same as the world has [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2034.82s)]
*  ever seen, you know, both of those regimes spent a huge amount of time and money on propaganda, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2040.82s)]
*  even though they had absolute power, they could kill anyone they wanted. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2047.1799999999998s)]
*  So you really do end up ruling by consent, whether you want to or not, whether it's manufactured [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2049.78s)]
*  consent or legitimate consent, but you have to control people's brains. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2055.7400000000002s)]
*  You can't just rule indefinitely at the point of a gun. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2060.1800000000003s)]
*  So you know, I'm not, I think you make a good point. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2064.0600000000004s)]
*  I want the people in charge to at least try to convince me because that shows respect. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2068.26s)]
*  I'm not sure what is going on, to be honest with you. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2075.5s)]
*  I mean, I haven't done hallucinogens in 35 years, but I'm getting that kind of weird [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2078.54s)]
*  kind of like dream sequence feeling about American politics right now. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2083.5s)]
*  I'm not quite sure what the hell is this. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2086.86s)]
*  Well, you had Ben Carson on recently. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2089.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2090.82s)]
*  And he said something that stuck with me. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2091.46s)]
*  I love Ben Carson. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2093.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2094.14s)]
*  He's a great human being. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2094.62s)]
*  And he's the perfect case study in the way that the media will destroy you as soon as [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2095.74s)]
*  you turn against their interests. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2101.74s)]
*  Yes. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2102.98s)]
*  Because Ben Carson was a celebrated neurosurgeon, pediatric neurosurgeon. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2103.86s)]
*  Up until the moment, and to the point that it was in childhood curriculums to learn about [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2109.42s)]
*  Ben Carson's life in schools. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2113.98s)]
*  And you'd read his book, Gifted Hands, and learn all about him. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2115.42s)]
*  They later made a famous Hollywood movie about his life. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2118.1s)]
*  And the second he ran for politics, they cast him as a moron. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2121.66s)]
*  He's an idiot. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2125.98s)]
*  He's an idiot. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2126.82s)]
*  He's so stupid. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2128.34s)]
*  He messed up brain surgeries all the time. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2129.2200000000003s)]
*  Right? [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2131.18s)]
*  You started seeing all these stories come out. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2131.5s)]
*  And then he was heralded by places like the New York Times. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2133.86s)]
*  And then, of course, and then after that, eviscerated. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2136.66s)]
*  The second he declared interest in Republican politics, and the second especially that he [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2138.5s)]
*  spoke up on behalf of life. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2142.22s)]
*  That was so on the God frequency, though, as you know. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2143.8199999999997s)]
*  I know you know him. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2146.62s)]
*  He's like, it doesn't even, it doesn't penetrate. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2147.42s)]
*  It doesn't bother him. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2149.74s)]
*  It doesn't bother him at all. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2150.42s)]
*  He's got such a great attitude. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2151.14s)]
*  I love it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2151.58s)]
*  It's infectious. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2152.06s)]
*  So he said to you that this switcheroo that they just pulled off is a test of the media's [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2152.94s)]
*  ability to rig the election. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2160.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2162.06s)]
*  Nicely put. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2162.66s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2163.46s)]
*  I love that because it's true. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2165.18s)]
*  And we're witnessing it right now. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2166.66s)]
*  So my thought process is, and I wonder about you too, is that at what point does the media's [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2169.46s)]
*  ego get in the way of their partisan priorities? [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2176.38s)]
*  In other words, Kamala is refusing to do interviews. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2179.42s)]
*  And right now, their partisan priorities are to get her elected. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2183.3s)]
*  But you and I both know these people in the press. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2186.22s)]
*  And if there's one thing that might override their partisan priorities, it's their obsession [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2189.18s)]
*  with themselves to the point that like this drum beat of like, why isn't she doing an [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2194.06s)]
*  interview? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2198.86s)]
*  Why isn't she sitting down with CNN? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2199.42s)]
*  Why isn't she sitting down with ABC? [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2200.7799999999997s)]
*  It's enough to be enticing to the people in that world that they're like, you're beginning [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2202.74s)]
*  to see at least little murmurs of it like, oh, she should do an interview. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2208.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, you know, the voters deserve that. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2211.22s)]
*  You're beginning to see, I think that their egos may override their partisan priorities. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2213.22s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2216.66s)]
*  I hope. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2217.54s)]
*  I guess the kind of argument would be to work at a place like NBC News or CNN. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2218.22s)]
*  I've worked at both. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2222.62s)]
*  Now requires total degradation. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2224.38s)]
*  Total. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2228.54s)]
*  Like you can have no self-respect at all. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2229.22s)]
*  Or you couldn't work there because you're being told to say things that are obviously [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2233.14s)]
*  untrue, to lie every single day. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2236.42s)]
*  There's no dissent allowed. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2239.14s)]
*  And your average adult man wouldn't put up with that because it's like, well, I have [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2240.62s)]
*  opinions too. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2243.74s)]
*  And as a like a human being and not a slave, I get to express my opinions. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2244.42s)]
*  No, you can't. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2248.22s)]
*  I think that's an intolerable work environment for anyone with any dignity at all. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2249.38s)]
*  Therefore, the people who work there, most of whom I know, they just don't have any [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2254.38s)]
*  dignity left. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2259.98s)]
*  I mean, I hope I'm wrong. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2261.6600000000003s)]
*  I want everyone to have dignity. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2263.3s)]
*  But I don't see it, do you? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2265.5s)]
*  No, it's like very humiliating. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2267.46s)]
*  It's so humiliating. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2269.3s)]
*  I work at CNN, really? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2271.1400000000003s)]
*  Just the crimes of omission are really obvious. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2273.5s)]
*  They're just liars. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2276.26s)]
*  And then to like go on TV and then to treat people who would support Trump with contempt, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2278.9s)]
*  which they were doing like this very weekend. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2283.26s)]
*  There's like the Sunday shows. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2284.7000000000003s)]
*  They're like, we interviewed these people and they have no idea what they're talking [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2285.78s)]
*  about is basically like what? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2288.38s)]
*  I know. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2290.6600000000003s)]
*  And you do? [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2291.1800000000003s)]
*  Living like this absurdly pampered life, like completely away from all of the problems [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2292.1800000000003s)]
*  that these people have, very real problems. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2297.98s)]
*  I saw Don LaMun is running around right now. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2302.62s)]
*  He's doing man on the street interviews. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2305.5s)]
*  That's his latest iteration. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2306.7000000000003s)]
*  For whom? [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2307.58s)]
*  For Don LaMun. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2308.5s)]
*  It's his DL on his microphone. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2309.98s)]
*  For his own- [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2312.3s)]
*  On his microphone. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2313.3s)]
*  I haven't talked to Don in a while. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2314.3s)]
*  I had high hopes for Don, but he learned nothing. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2315.3s)]
*  I know you did. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2317.06s)]
*  I know you did. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2318.06s)]
*  I know, sad. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2319.06s)]
*  Because you're good about that. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2320.06s)]
*  But when he was talking to these- [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2321.06s)]
*  We got fired the same day. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2322.58s)]
*  Yeah, I know. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2324.02s)]
*  I called him right away. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2325.14s)]
*  But yeah, I call everyone when they're fired, period. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2327.82s)]
*  But yeah, Don, I wanted him, because usually getting fired, you know, you learn something [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2331.78s)]
*  about yourself. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2338.1s)]
*  Sure, it's humbling. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2339.1s)]
*  It's so important to be fired regularly, I would say, especially if you're arrogant like [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2340.74s)]
*  I am. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2344.7799999999997s)]
*  So I've really enjoyed getting fired. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2345.7799999999997s)]
*  And I thought this will be totally good for Don. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2347.3399999999997s)]
*  It'll be totally good for me, which it was. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2348.94s)]
*  But Don didn't seem to even pause. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2351.9s)]
*  No. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2354.86s)]
*  And the giveaway was his interview with Elon Musk. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2356.18s)]
*  It was a total disaster because he refused to take any inventory of his priors. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2358.94s)]
*  It was entirely a political, partisan talking points exercise. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2362.58s)]
*  It was really embarrassing, actually, because if Don Lemon, I want to get back to his man [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2366.62s)]
*  on the street thing in a minute, but Don Lemon, like a decade ago, was willing to say things [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2371.9399999999996s)]
*  on television that his network didn't agree with. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2376.1s)]
*  And there's like this famous Morgan Freeman interview he did, where the two of them were [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2379.7s)]
*  sitting around talking about how obsessing over race actually exacerbates racial division [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2383.2799999999997s)]
*  in the country. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2388.06s)]
*  And we should stop doing that. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2389.06s)]
*  That's what the two of them sitting there agreeing on that subject. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2390.06s)]
*  I was like, what happened to that guy? [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2392.3399999999997s)]
*  He just sold out, I guess. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2395.42s)]
*  From afar, I don't know him. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2397.34s)]
*  But how can you get fired if you're Don Lemon and you're hired at CNN, you're gay, you're [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2398.34s)]
*  black, you obviously can never be fired, obviously, because you can't fire someone in those categories. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2405.42s)]
*  Ask anyone who runs a business. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2411.34s)]
*  You can't. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2412.54s)]
*  You're afraid to. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2413.54s)]
*  And they fire you anyway. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2414.54s)]
*  Then at least part of you has to think, how did I get fired? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2417.42s)]
*  What did I do wrong? [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2420.86s)]
*  I must have played some role in this. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2421.86s)]
*  They suck. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2423.26s)]
*  Okay, that's fine. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2424.26s)]
*  I'm mad at them. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2426.1400000000003s)]
*  I get it. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2427.1400000000003s)]
*  I've certainly been there. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2428.1400000000003s)]
*  But come on. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2429.1400000000003s)]
*  It's like a marriage. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2430.1400000000003s)]
*  If it blows up, each side has some culpability. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2431.1400000000003s)]
*  What's mine? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2434.5800000000004s)]
*  What did I do wrong? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2435.5800000000004s)]
*  That's true. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2436.5800000000004s)]
*  I don't think he even... [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2437.5800000000004s)]
*  And I had a long conversation with him on the phone. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2438.5800000000004s)]
*  I should have said, Don, you've got good... [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2440.6600000000003s)]
*  I think Don has good qualities, great qualities for TV, actually. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2444.6600000000003s)]
*  And I told him that. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2448.78s)]
*  But you should just really pause and ask yourself, yes, CNN sucks. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2450.5400000000004s)]
*  I can confirm that as a former employee. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2454.78s)]
*  But you kind of suck too. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2457.82s)]
*  So that's what fired people have to ask themselves. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2459.6200000000003s)]
*  But he never did. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2462.98s)]
*  Well, the underlying question for, at least for me, watching from the outside was, okay, [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2463.98s)]
*  so now he's free. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2468.94s)]
*  He doesn't have anybody telling him what he has to say. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2469.94s)]
*  I know. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2473.46s)]
*  So great. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2474.46s)]
*  The script is gone. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2475.46s)]
*  And there's nobody, there's no advertisers for you to... [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2476.46s)]
*  In fact, you can build your own. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2478.1400000000003s)]
*  You have to... [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2479.1400000000003s)]
*  That whole world. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2480.1400000000003s)]
*  And he stuck to the script. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2481.46s)]
*  I was like, oh, so I guess he truly believes this nonsense. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2482.54s)]
*  And that gets to this man on the street. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2486.06s)]
*  He's talking to people like all across, I guess, across the country. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2487.7s)]
*  He's going to different places or beach communities that he's staying in. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2490.2200000000003s)]
*  And he just happens to put a microphone in people's faces. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2492.82s)]
*  I'm not sure. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2494.58s)]
*  But he's talking to people and he's asking them who you're supporting. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2495.58s)]
*  And he's getting a lot of people saying, Trump, I'm voting for Trump. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2497.82s)]
*  And a lot of black people responding, I'm voting for Trump. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2501.58s)]
*  And in one, he confronts the guy who says, I was better off financially under Trump. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2504.42s)]
*  He says, that's not true. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2510.58s)]
*  That's not true. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2513.94s)]
*  Don Lemon told me. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2514.94s)]
*  No, you were happier when Trump wasn't president. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2515.94s)]
*  He's like, fact check false. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2518.62s)]
*  Fact check false. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2519.62s)]
*  Did he actually say it? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2520.62s)]
*  He didn't say the words fact check false, but he virtually did it. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2521.62s)]
*  He was like, no, no, no, things are much better now economically. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2525.46s)]
*  And you're like, what world is he living in? [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2527.98s)]
*  And I guess in some sense, it's definitely, I guess he buys into the facade. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2531.8199999999997s)]
*  If he truly believes it, he buys into the facade because all this conversation about [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2537.5s)]
*  the economy, it's very skin deep. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2542.14s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2545.22s)]
*  Well, among the things you really can't live without are antibiotics. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2546.22s)]
*  They are life saving. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2550.1s)]
*  Get an infection, you need antibiotics or you could die. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2551.1s)]
*  But one of the things a lot of us have learned over the last few years is that most of our [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2554.78s)]
*  antibiotics come from outside the country. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2558.34s)]
*  So that means to stay alive, many of us are depending on a supply chain from China. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2561.54s)]
*  So if you're in a family or people around you, you care about just remember that supply [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2568.1s)]
*  chain from China could be the thing keeping them alive. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2573.84s)]
*  What if something went wrong with the supply chain from China? [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2577.54s)]
*  Well, we don't have to imagine that we just saw that during COVID, the lunacy of COVID [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2580.58s)]
*  foreign supply chains collapsed in some cases, leaving American consumers without products [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2585.74s)]
*  they needed. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2591.32s)]
*  Products as simple as toilet paper, machine parts and potentially antibiotics. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2592.32s)]
*  This is something we're thinking about. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2597.0800000000004s)]
*  You're not crazy. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2598.32s)]
*  You're not some radical prepper to want to have a steady supply of life saving medicine [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2599.52s)]
*  in case something went wrong. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2605.0800000000004s)]
*  We spent a lot of time thinking about this because you need to. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2606.1600000000003s)]
*  You need an emergency supply, of course, of water, food. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2610.92s)]

*  They want to get it done and over with so people don't think about him [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2889.8399999999997s)]
*  for the rest of the week. Good point. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2892.7599999999998s)]
*  It's the whole thing. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2894.2799999999997s)]
*  And, you know, and they're dressing it up as, oh, it's a theme. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2895.4399999999996s)]
*  You know, we have him first and then Obama second and Clinton third. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2897.84s)]
*  And then Kamala finishes things off. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2900.88s)]
*  This is what they want to leave you with. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2903.44s)]
*  But realistically, you understand the tactics here. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2904.52s)]
*  It's like they want to bury this. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2906.96s)]
*  They know they've got to feature him, but they want to bury it on. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2908.4s)]
*  If the DNC was a fancy restaurant, [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2910.6000000000004s)]
*  Biden would be seated right next to the men's room. For sure. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2913.56s)]
*  That is not a fashionable table. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2916.84s)]
*  He's in the last row and coach [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2918.28s)]
*  totally really upset that there's a line for the bathroom next to him. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2921.08s)]
*  He's in a middle seat. Yeah, that's [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2924.7200000000003s)]
*  it's such a good point. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2928.32s)]
*  But I mean, he deserves it and so much more and he'll get [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2930.0s)]
*  he'll get what he deserves. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2933.48s)]
*  But like, it does seem like prerequisite for party membership [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2935.08s)]
*  is being willing to set aside your own interests, your own self-respect, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2940.2400000000002s)]
*  your own dignity on behalf of the collective. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2945.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, how bitter do you think he is about this in real life? [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2948.48s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2952.8s)]
*  I don't know to what extent he's capable of complex emotions [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2953.6000000000004s)]
*  or thoughts like that at the stage because he is impaired. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2957.36s)]
*  But I know pretty certainly that his wife and his son and his daughter, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2961.08s)]
*  you know, feel the sting. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2969.48s)]
*  How could they not? Yeah. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2970.88s)]
*  Guys president, he is still president, right? [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2972.2400000000002s)]
*  But then Obama stabbed him in the back [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2975.88s)]
*  and in the front and, you know, Nancy Pelosi stabbed him. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2978.88s)]
*  They all did. They swooped in and they took him out. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2982.04s)]
*  And they're not really ashamed of it at all. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2984.76s)]
*  They're like they're pretty nakedly brazen about it. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2986.48s)]
*  And that's and that's what we're left with. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2990.0s)]
*  And like it is so fundamentally at its core, anti-democratic. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2992.6s)]
*  It's not about at all about the consent of the governed. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=2997.76s)]
*  In fact, the primary itself was rigged. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3000.76s)]
*  I mean, Biden should have never even been on their primary ballot. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3002.52s)]
*  The voters, 14 million, which is not that many people, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3005.32s)]
*  but 14 million people registered the thoughts on the subject. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3007.44s)]
*  And they said, we're with Biden. But again, it was it was rigged. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3010.12s)]
*  They kept everybody else off the ballot. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3012.2400000000002s)]
*  They wanted to keep RFK away from it. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3013.76s)]
*  And Dean Phillips and anybody who would possibly even deter [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3015.52s)]
*  from from Biden gathering my pal, Jill Stein. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3019.56s)]
*  Yeah, Jill Stein. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3022.72s)]
*  Oh, but can I just ask just [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3024.0s)]
*  like about the nature of the Democratic Party? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3027.04s)]
*  It's I don't vote Democrat because I don't agree with them on most things. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3029.56s)]
*  Well, now I don't agree with them on anything. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3034.32s)]
*  But really, I don't vote Democrat because I don't understand [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3037.64s)]
*  like the requirements for membership. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3042.68s)]
*  Like you've got a couple of brothers, parents, wife, child. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3045.56s)]
*  You know, you've got a very I know your family, very close family. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3051.0s)]
*  If somebody said, you know, in order to remain a conservative [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3053.12s)]
*  or a Republican or a radio show host in good standing, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3056.96s)]
*  you have to denounce your brother, Fred. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3060.12s)]
*  Not a chance. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3062.52s)]
*  Like, I think you'd die before you did that. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3063.7599999999998s)]
*  Not a chance in the world. Right. That's right. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3065.44s)]
*  Not a chance. If they told me to reject the tenets of my faith, I wouldn't. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3067.52s)]
*  If they told me to attack my family, I wouldn't. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3070.96s)]
*  Under any circumstance. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3073.56s)]
*  No. In fact, that courtesy, that that obligation extends to the people [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3074.52s)]
*  I care about who aren't my family members. Me too. Me too. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3079.08s)]
*  So that's like so personal loyalty is more important to you. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3081.2000000000003s)]
*  Love is more important to you than any human made structure. Correct. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3085.44s)]
*  The hundred percent. Right. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3089.8s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3091.44s)]
*  That's not true for partisan Democrats. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3092.6s)]
*  It's not true in the Biden family. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3094.8s)]
*  Just look at what they did with Joe. I know. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3097.16s)]
*  I don't there's no circumstance where I let my senile grandfather [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3099.88s)]
*  like run the country. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3104.56s)]
*  Yes. Nevertheless, drive a car. I know. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3106.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, you take away his license and you figure out how to take care of him. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3108.2400000000002s)]
*  How many people do you know where as they had relative [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3111.96s)]
*  advance to like really late stage of losing their faculties, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3114.84s)]
*  they had to take their guns away or like take their license away. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3118.76s)]
*  That's right. It's a super difficult conversation. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3122.52s)]
*  But it's one that's done out of immense love. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3125.32s)]
*  It's really hard. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3127.96s)]
*  And that's not that's not what happened here. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3129.08s)]
*  Instead, we all got stuck with the liabilities, the country that is. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3131.2s)]
*  And, you know, I do think that obviously crystal clear, as you've said [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3135.88s)]
*  for so long and I've been saying a long time, there's still a lot of string [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3139.84s)]
*  pulling going on with Biden. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3143.44s)]
*  Yeah. You're supposed to comfort yourself with this notion that somebody else [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3144.6s)]
*  is actually running the show. Don't worry. The senile guy's not. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3147.64s)]
*  But I actually think the most dangerous answer is that he is in charge of some things. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3150.44s)]
*  And I think some of the chaos we've seen is the result of that. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3154.08s)]
*  I think Afghanistan in a big way was probably as a result of his senility. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3157.96s)]
*  The fact that we lost all those people, 13, and then he gets there to that [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3163.68s)]
*  dignified transfer of remains, which should be a dignified transfer [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3167.6s)]
*  remains in Delaware and doesn't for a moment [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3170.36s)]
*  give them the decency that they deserve in light of his decisions. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3174.36s)]
*  He talks about himself and his his own son who died in Iraq in a firefight. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3177.24s)]
*  Yeah. Ignores them. Stares at his watch. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3181.04s)]
*  It's it's some of the most offensive things that any of us have ever seen. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3184.12s)]
*  Well, he did something that I saw personally up close [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3188.56s)]
*  several years ago before he ran. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3192.48s)]
*  That was one of the lowest things I've ever seen. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3195.48s)]
*  He had this daughter in law, his son, Hunter's wife, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3197.12s)]
*  who I thought was a great person. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3201.28s)]
*  I thought she was a great person. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3203.6s)]
*  And he winds up having an affair with his sister in law. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3205.28s)]
*  And, you know, obviously, this is devastating to his wife and three children. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3208.64s)]
*  You know, but these things, you know, whatever I'm trying to judge. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3214.4s)]
*  But it's a big deal, right. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3217.6s)]
*  And it's a big deal in the neighborhood that we live in in D.C. at the time. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3219.0s)]
*  And Joe Biden in his horrible, [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3222.24s)]
*  disgusting, ludicrous, fake doctor wife [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3226.88s)]
*  issue this statement saying we support [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3229.68s)]
*  Hunter and his new love, you know, our deceased son's widow. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3233.16s)]
*  And don't even mention his daughter in law, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3239.0s)]
*  who has been a loyal family member for over 20 years, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3242.92s)]
*  has traveled a lot with Joe Biden because his wife didn't want to go with him. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3246.1600000000003s)]
*  I saw this. And, you know, Kathleen Biden's like the mother of their three grandchildren. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3248.92s)]
*  Like, this is not my business. Someone else's family. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3254.6400000000003s)]
*  OK, I generally try not to judge these things. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3256.6000000000004s)]
*  But he issues a public statement saying we're on the new chick side. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3258.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, what about this girl was your daughter? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3263.44s)]
*  I have a daughter in law. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3265.32s)]
*  Like, I know that's a really intense and important relationship in a family, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3266.1600000000003s)]
*  particularly the father and his daughter in law. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3270.28s)]
*  The mother of your grandchildren? [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3272.32s)]
*  Are you joking? Yeah. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3273.84s)]
*  And they just ignore her like she never existed? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3275.2400000000002s)]
*  I thought I was so offended by that. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3279.2400000000002s)]
*  I just couldn't believe a man would do that. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3282.4s)]
*  And then they reiterated it with London Roberts. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3284.6800000000003s)]
*  She's been a loyal, good daughter. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3286.52s)]
*  They did the same thing with London Roberts and her daughter, Navy Joan. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3287.96s)]
*  You know, they they honor her daughter, you know, just ignoring her existence. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3291.36s)]
*  Not even like like actually going out of their way to insult her existence [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3295.84s)]
*  with the whole like stockings thing at Christmas. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3300.04s)]
*  Like they won't even hang her name up. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3301.84s)]
*  They refuse to acknowledge she exists. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3303.04s)]
*  And to this day, I just talked to London Roberts not long ago. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3305.16s)]
*  We interviewed her. She put a book out about the subject. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3307.72s)]
*  And it's kind of she still wants to kind of earn her way into their world, I think. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3310.96s)]
*  That's the impression I got. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3315.48s)]
*  And I don't think she should bother with that at all, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3316.96s)]
*  because, like, they've been pretty clear about what they think of her and the family. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3320.2s)]
*  How could you do that? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3323.56s)]
*  William F. Buckley did that to his son, had an illegitimate child. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3325.52s)]
*  His grandson and William F. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3329.96s)]
*  Buckley in his will said, I'm not, you know, no money for him. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3331.8s)]
*  If I'm remembering this correctly. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3334.52s)]
*  And I'm sorry, I know everyone reveres William F. Buckley, but I just I lost all respect. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3336.52s)]
*  And I have no respect for that at all. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3341.32s)]
*  If you your child or grandchild, like that's really important. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3342.76s)]
*  The grandchild is innocent. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3347.88s)]
*  Well, I totally agree. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3349.16s)]
*  And your blood. Yeah, I know. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3350.28s)]
*  Sorry. I don't get it. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3352.32s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3353.32s)]
*  So sidetracked. But like, I think Joe Biden is actually a really rotten person, [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3354.04s)]
*  I guess is what I'm saying. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3358.56s)]
*  I hate to say that. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3359.52s)]
*  And I think it matters. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3360.56s)]
*  So what sort of person you are. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3361.64s)]
*  I do. Everyone's like, oh, it doesn't matter. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3363.16s)]
*  What matters to me? [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3364.8s)]
*  Yeah, it does matter. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3365.96s)]
*  And all of the like the you know, and Trump is a complicated person, of course. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3367.88s)]
*  And he's got he has moral failings, no question. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3371.7599999999998s)]
*  But the lies that we're constantly told about his moral failings are like absurd. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3374.08s)]
*  Like the idea that he's like trying to personally profit off of the presidency. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3378.68s)]
*  Like all of the available evidence [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3382.96s)]
*  like demonstrates the complete opposite. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3385.88s)]
*  Like he's lost billions of dollars in net worth by doing it. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3387.52s)]
*  It's endless hassle, endless litigation and like like what deal has existed [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3389.6s)]
*  that has enriched him as a result of having been in the press. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3395.16s)]
*  He's gotten a lot poorer for sure. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3397.84s)]
*  Does feel to me like he's going to go to jail if he doesn't win. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3401.4s)]
*  They're going to put him in jail. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3406.08s)]
*  They're very desperate for that. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3407.0s)]
*  Are they going to put him in jail before? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3408.2400000000002s)]
*  I keep hearing people keep sending me this stuff. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3409.84s)]
*  That sentencing date is mid-September. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3411.8s)]
*  That's correct. The 18th, I think. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3413.68s)]
*  And they really want to. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3415.2s)]
*  I I this will come down to, I think, a political assessment [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3418.48s)]
*  because they don't want to martyr him ahead of it. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3422.8799999999997s)]
*  So the so putting a man in jail two months, you know, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3426.04s)]
*  yes, before a presidential election. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3430.48s)]
*  No, that's right. On fake charges. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3432.8799999999997s)]
*  That's right. But that that judge, remember, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3434.3599999999997s)]
*  he kept threatening him with all these gag orders and saying, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3436.2s)]
*  oh, you violated it, violated it. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3438.24s)]
*  But he never quite put him in jail, even though he was constantly hanging [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3439.2799999999997s)]
*  that threat out there. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3442.12s)]
*  I think it's because they became aware during the trial [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3443.12s)]
*  that this was backfiring politically. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3446.0s)]
*  So it wasn't just Biden self-immolating. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3447.88s)]
*  It was that the public started becoming convinced that Trump really is [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3449.72s)]
*  a victim of a rigged system. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3452.68s)]
*  And that was showing up in the polls throughout that process. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3454.56s)]
*  And so they have to be cognizant of this. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3458.08s)]
*  Now, I won't put it past them to do something tyrannical [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3459.96s)]
*  that's against their political interests because they have this [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3462.88s)]
*  they can't control themselves. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3465.48s)]
*  Yeah. But if one of the factors, it's so unfortunate that that's it. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3466.8399999999997s)]
*  That's what it's all about. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3470.92s)]
*  It's hard to believe. [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3471.72s)]
*  Yeah, I guess this is the disadvantage, as I said earlier, of age. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3472.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like I refuse to believe that could even happen in the United States. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3476.7599999999998s)]
*  But if it did, I think we could wind up. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3480.12s)]
*  I mean, that close to the election, I don't know if they'll do it. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3482.7999999999997s)]
*  But this is here's the thing that still amazes me. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3484.72s)]
*  July 13th, Trump was shot in the head. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3488.8799999999997s)]
*  This year, in case you were forgetting, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3492.72s)]
*  the news cycle lasted maybe a week, maybe two on that subject. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3495.9599999999996s)]
*  And it's evaporated. It's gone. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3501.2000000000003s)]
*  Do you I mean, I was I know how quickly news cycles move. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3503.96s)]
*  So I and the desire not to talk about that, I could I could smell it [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3508.36s)]
*  coming a thousand miles away. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3511.92s)]
*  I knew that they would move on. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3513.08s)]
*  Well, the Trump people didn't want to talk about it, to be honest. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3514.08s)]
*  But the Biden Secret Service allowed Trump to get shot in the face. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3517.0s)]
*  They allowed it, whether, you know, intentionally or not. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3521.4s)]
*  So like, why is that not the biggest story in the world? [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3523.76s)]
*  You would think it would be the biggest story all the way through the election. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3525.92s)]
*  Like in like in once again, normal America, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3528.2s)]
*  if a presidential candidate gets shot in the head, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3531.64s)]
*  you would think that the overflowing of sympathy and certainly all of the media [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3535.2s)]
*  attention on that subject would basically put him on a glide path to the election, [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3538.0s)]
*  that for the remainder of the election, which is not that much time left, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3541.24s)]
*  that we be litigating all this had this happen, how do we prevent it from happening? [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3544.48s)]
*  Why does somebody shoot Trump? [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3548.0s)]
*  The underlying motivations. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3549.3999999999996s)]
*  Have you noticed like there's no conversation about that anymore? [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3550.8399999999997s)]
*  The motive, the motive question disappeared in like five seconds. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3553.2s)]
*  It was like the Vegas shooter. It disappeared. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3555.8399999999997s)]
*  He was just your average 20 year old with no social media profile whatsoever. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3557.88s)]
*  No motive at all. No one helped him do it. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3561.5200000000004s)]
*  And, you know, there was no real security failure at all. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3565.36s)]
*  You just couldn't put an agent on a roof with a pitch that steep. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3569.7200000000003s)]
*  It's just it's pretty, pretty conventional stuff. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3572.4s)]
*  140 yards from the from the stage. Yeah. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3574.92s)]
*  But you saw the Biden administration [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3579.1200000000003s)]
*  allow an assassination attempt to shooting. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3581.48s)]
*  And that's just a fact. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3585.0s)]
*  That's a fact. They allowed that. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3587.08s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying they did it on purpose. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3589.04s)]
*  Seems pretty clear they did. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3592.64s)]
*  How could that not be on purpose? [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3593.68s)]
*  But I don't have any proof of that. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3595.04s)]
*  But they they allowed it. We can say that conclusively. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3596.44s)]
*  And no one ever mentioned it again. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3599.2400000000002s)]
*  And Republicans don't mention it. I don't understand why. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3600.92s)]
*  One of the ways I think that they allowed it, one of the because [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3604.16s)]
*  once you're knocking on really important doors [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3607.84s)]
*  and like if you start opening a bunch of them, eventually you get to a place [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3610.52s)]
*  you're like, man, this is really dark. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3613.2s)]
*  What we just saw. It's so dark. I agree. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3614.4399999999996s)]
*  I think one place that I've been in is that the Biden administration [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3616.8399999999997s)]
*  is ruthless in in how they wield the government politically, as we know, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3622.3199999999997s)]
*  with the United States Department of Justice. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3626.2s)]
*  And they they resent the fact that Trump gets secret service protection at all. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3628.2799999999997s)]
*  They hate that they have to give him by virtue of the law [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3634.3599999999997s)]
*  as a former president, secret service protection. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3637.7999999999997s)]
*  So to the extent that they give him anything, [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3640.2799999999997s)]
*  they're just like, whatever, we'll send him something. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3642.56s)]
*  But protecting him, not a priority. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3645.56s)]
*  Protecting Dr. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3647.72s)]
*  Jill when she's doing an event in Pittsburgh in an indoor arena [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3648.6s)]
*  just down the road from Trump, you know, in a really sophisticated way [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3651.44s)]
*  with all the teams necessary to protect her and going above and beyond. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3655.6s)]
*  100 percent. We'll do that. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3658.7599999999998s)]
*  Yeah. The repulsive fake Dr. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3659.92s)]
*  Harpe wife gets all the bodyguards she wants. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3661.84s)]
*  But but the candidate doesn't. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3664.04s)]
*  But the Secret Service director that she handpicked for the role, Kim Cheadle, [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3665.36s)]
*  because Kim Cheadle served on Jill Biden's detail [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3671.16s)]
*  when she was in the White House originally with Joe Biden was vice president. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3674.12s)]
*  So so so they choose Kim Cheadle to run the show. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3678.7999999999997s)]
*  The last thing they're going to do is concern themselves with how safe is Trump [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3682.12s)]
*  and should we give him what he needs? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3684.96s)]
*  Screw that guy. We'll give him the bare minimum. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3686.12s)]
*  Meanwhile, in case you're looking for evidence that Biden and Jill [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3688.68s)]
*  and the Secret Service are political, look no further than RFK. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3694.08s)]
*  RFK asked for Secret Service protection [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3697.44s)]
*  because he's from the most assassinated family in American political history [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3699.7999999999997s)]
*  and because there's actual threats to his life and he actually needs it [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3703.24s)]
*  in order to conduct a presidential campaign. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3706.44s)]
*  But because they were they were so petty that they didn't want to dignify [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3708.3599999999997s)]
*  his campaign as real, they refused to give him Secret Service protection [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3712.8399999999997s)]
*  merely because they didn't want to give him the visual [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3716.6s)]
*  of being considered a presidential candidate. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3719.52s)]
*  That's it. They're just like, screw that guy. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3722.0s)]
*  So they're making all these political considerations. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3724.0s)]
*  They refuse to give RFK protection. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3726.04s)]
*  And then Trump, they barely give him they give him the B squad. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3727.68s)]
*  And he gets shot in the head. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3731.56s)]
*  That's one interpretation of events. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3734.36s)]
*  Yeah. Here are a couple of fat girls who don't operate a firearm. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3735.8s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. OK. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3738.48s)]
*  Most of us, well, actually all of us go through our daily lives [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3740.7599999999998s)]
*  using all sorts of, quote, free technology [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3743.84s)]
*  without paying attention to why it's, quote, free. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3747.08s)]
*  Who's paying for this and how? [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3750.32s)]
*  Think about it for a minute. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3752.56s)]
*  Think about your free email account, the free messenger system [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3753.72s)]
*  used to chat with your friends, the free weather app or game app [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3757.52s)]
*  you open up and never think about. It's all free. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3761.9199999999996s)]
*  But is it? No, it's not free. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3765.16s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3768.68s)]
*  and just giving them to you because they love you. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3771.12s)]
*  They're doing it because their programs take all your information. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3774.3999999999996s)]
*  They hoover up your data, private personal data and sell it to data brokers. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3777.16s)]
*  And the government and all of those people who are not your friends [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3782.6000000000004s)]
*  are very interested in manipulating you and your personal, political [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3787.32s)]
*  and financial decisions. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3791.1200000000003s)]
*  It's scary as hell. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3792.4s)]
*  And it's happening out in the open without anybody saying anything about it. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3794.1200000000003s)]
*  This is a huge problem. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3798.1600000000003s)]
*  And we've been talking about this problem to our friend, Eric Prince, for years. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3799.36s)]
*  Somebody needs to fix this. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3803.0800000000004s)]
*  And he and his partners have. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3804.92s)]
*  And now we're partners with them and their company is called Unplugged. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3806.32s)]
*  It's not a software company. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3810.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a hardware company. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3811.44s)]
*  They actually make a phone. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3813.0s)]
*  The phone is called Unplugged. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3815.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's more than that. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3817.32s)]
*  The purpose of the phone is to protect you from having. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3818.44s)]
*  Your life stolen, your data stolen. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3823.56s)]
*  It's designed from a privacy first perspective. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3826.2000000000003s)]
*  It's got an operating system that they made. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3830.48s)]
*  It's called Messenger and other apps that help you take charge [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3832.08s)]
*  of your personal data and prevent it from getting passed around [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3834.44s)]
*  to data brokers and government agencies that will use it to manipulate you. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3837.88s)]
*  Unplugged's commitment is to its customers. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3842.32s)]
*  They will promise you and they mean it that your data are not being sold [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3844.56s)]
*  or monetized or shared with anyone. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3848.08s)]
*  From basics like its custom Libertas operating system, which they wrote, [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3850.92s)]
*  which is designed from the very first day to keep your personal data [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3855.0s)]
*  on your device. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3858.04s)]
*  It also has, believe it or not, a true on off switch that shuts off the power. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3859.6800000000003s)]
*  It actually disconnects your battery [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3864.36s)]
*  and ensures that your microphone and your camera are turned off [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3866.52s)]
*  completely when you want them to be. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3869.96s)]
*  So they're not spying on you and say your bedroom, which your iPhone is. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3872.32s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3875.92s)]
*  So it is a great way, one of the few ways to actually protect yourself [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3877.56s)]
*  from big tech and big government to reclaim your personal privacy. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3881.12s)]
*  Without privacy, there is no freedom. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3885.28s)]
*  The unplugged phone, you can get a $25 discount [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3887.64s)]
*  when you use the code Tucker at the checkout. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3890.08s)]
*  So go to unplugged.com [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3892.68s)]
*  slash Tucker to get yours today. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3894.6s)]
*  Highly recommended. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3897.2s)]
*  Yeah, it is. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3898.64s)]
*  It's so overwhelming that because if you live in a country [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3899.36s)]
*  where the Secret Service is corrupted. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3903.16s)]
*  And we clearly do live in that country, then it's like at that point, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3906.96s)]
*  you know, that's a life or death thing. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3910.16s)]
*  You know, that's not the education department. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3911.7999999999997s)]
*  That's it. That's a core function. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3913.44s)]
*  They investigate who left cocaine at the White House, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3915.04s)]
*  and then they destroy the evidence within weeks. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3917.4s)]
*  And they say the investigation is closed. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3919.64s)]
*  There's no chance we'll ever get to the bottom of it. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3921.36s)]
*  They destroyed it. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3924.1600000000003s)]
*  They didn't keep it. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3925.32s)]
*  How much cocaine could they possibly have had? [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3926.1600000000003s)]
*  It's not like they were running out of real estate. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3927.76s)]
*  Just keep it in the evidence room. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3931.0s)]
*  You know, we can keep this for a while. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3932.1200000000003s)]
*  We'll keep the case open. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3933.84s)]
*  We'll see if we can get some answers. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3934.76s)]
*  They destroyed it. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3935.76s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3936.96s)]
*  Yeah, it tells you that maybe the one the agencies [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3939.6400000000003s)]
*  that can never be corrupted, no matter what, that have to remain [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3944.44s)]
*  as pure as any government agency can remain pure. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3948.48s)]
*  Have been totally, you know, so that would include, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3951.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm sorry to say it in your presence. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3954.56s)]
*  I know you're a product of a military family, but DOD, FBI. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3956.08s)]
*  And Secret Service and, of course, CIA and DIA. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3960.84s)]
*  And they're working really hard to do it to the Supreme Court right now. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3963.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, I know. They're working very hard to corrupt that institution [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3966.2000000000003s)]
*  because it's not serving their power interests, [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3969.2000000000003s)]
*  at least not to the extent that they want it to. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3971.04s)]
*  And so that needs to be corrupted, too. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3973.08s)]
*  It's a it's a virus and it just it just keeps on spreading. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3975.4s)]
*  It just keeps spreading. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3978.2000000000003s)]
*  And now they're using Kamala as the vehicle for all of this. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3979.8s)]
*  And she is so. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3983.36s)]
*  Don't she's shockingly dumb. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3986.1600000000003s)]
*  Is she? You can tell, can't you tell? [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3989.8s)]

*  Well, she's dumb in a in a in a she's socially dumb. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3995.0800000000004s)]
*  She she doesn't know how to communicate with people. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=3997.96s)]
*  Yes. Human beings are alien to her. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4000.0s)]
*  Yes. And she really doesn't have time for them. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4002.28s)]
*  And she she tries to figure out a way to condescend to them. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4004.52s)]
*  And then she just ends up speaking in circles. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4007.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. Because she doesn't actually know how to communicate. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4009.36s)]
*  Well, she kissed her husband with a mask on. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4011.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, as a married person, I looked at that. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4013.32s)]
*  And I was like, there's there's kind of no explaining that. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4016.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, that is sort of the end of any potential respect [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4020.56s)]

*  I'm sorry that that it's so it's so funny to live in a society [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4039.88s)]
*  where you have to deny obvious things. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4044.52s)]
*  I look at Tim Walls like, oh, I know exactly who you are. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4046.2000000000003s)]

*  But having spent four years in a New England boarding school in the 80s, like [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4060.8s)]

*  Well, he did show up in your room late night drunk to talk about stuff. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4072.92s)]
*  Yeah. You know, he's like he's like he's absurd. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4076.04s)]
*  He's a cartoon character. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4078.88s)]
*  And so he is a tyrannical cartoon character. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4079.6800000000003s)]
*  I well, of course. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4081.4s)]
*  So like he did he did start the gay club at his high school. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4082.52s)]
*  Oh, I'm very aware of that. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4085.2000000000003s)]

*  Yeah, totally normal. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4088.6400000000003s)]
*  He was the you know, he was just he was just sick of bullying. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4089.7200000000003s)]
*  You know, he just couldn't he couldn't handle the bullying. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4092.96s)]
*  But he was just pretty sure it's just so funny for a guy who shot his own [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4095.2400000000002s)]
*  residence with paintballs for standing on their porch. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4099.52s)]
*  And that's who established a snitch line during Covid for non-compliance. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4102.6s)]
*  With it's all of it's all of a piece, I would say it's all very consistent with what [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4108.08s)]
*  I mean, I remember. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4112.32s)]

*  Can't even get into this. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4116.8s)]
*  But the bottom line is I look at Tim Walls and I'm like, I know exactly. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4118.24s)]
*  You could have been you could have been the doormaster on my hall in 1984. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4122.6s)]

*  Oh, like everything about him is. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4139.0s)]
*  Does anyone else notice this about Tim Walls? [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4141.0s)]
*  I mean, is this. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4142.84s)]
*  I again, I shouldn't. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4144.400000000001s)]
*  I'm probably way over my skis. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4146.4400000000005s)]
*  I have zero evidence other than just what seems clear. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4147.64s)]
*  Like I want some of the best advice I ever got, which has turned out to be true all [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4151.56s)]
*  these decades later from a really wise person is like, trust your instincts on people. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4155.56s)]
*  Like, OK. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4160.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, he allowed American cities to burn to the ground. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4161.52s)]
*  I think you can mock him a little bit. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4163.92s)]
*  I think that's allowed for me. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4165.52s)]
*  I know you just hate to say things that you can't. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4167.120000000001s)]
*  I'm I'm I'm doing heavy implication here, but they got there's something wrong with the guy. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4169.8s)]
*  I guess it's just really obvious. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4174.400000000001s)]
*  Does it does it matter? [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4175.68s)]
*  He's the running mate. He's the beta. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4177.0s)]
*  He's in the bitch seat. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4178.76s)]
*  Does it actually matter politically? [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4179.64s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4181.160000000001s)]
*  Maybe. But maybe I just don't want somebody working out their issues while trying to take [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4182.280000000001s)]
*  charge of the country. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4186.08s)]
*  The whole thing. These people are all freaks. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4186.8s)]
*  There's not like one person who has a normal, happy personal life. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4188.6s)]
*  Like and by the way, they're very few on the Republican side. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4194.160000000001s)]
*  Very. JD Vance is one of them, which is one of the reasons I was so enthusiastic. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4196.320000000001s)]
*  They got this pretty normal guy, actually. [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4199.72s)]
*  But I think it really matters if you don't if you don't go home to some normal [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4202.08s)]
*  relationship that's based on love and respect and honesty. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4207.16s)]
*  If you're kissing your husband with a mask on or shaking hands with your wife, you're a freak. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4211.8s)]
*  And I feel sorry for you, but no, you can't have power. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4217.12s)]
*  No power for you, freak. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4220.24s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4222.2s)]
*  This this weekend, they put Kamala in some like like small test unscripted moments. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4223.04s)]
*  Let's see what she can do with this. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4229.68s)]
*  You know, and it all went disastrously. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4230.88s)]
*  But one of them was that she was in Pennsylvania. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4233.24s)]
*  She stopped at a Sheetz gas station. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4235.08s)]
*  Now, when I think Sheetz, I think it's basically like a wow. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4236.8s)]
*  Like it's a touch screen sandwich shop. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4239.84s)]
*  You know, you go and you enter your order and then the sandwich shop a few minutes later. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4242.12s)]
*  Somebody makes it. I thought it was a gas station. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4245.68s)]
*  Yeah, it's a gas station. But fundamentally, on the inside, if you're going to visit the indoors of it, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4247.72s)]
*  you're sandwich there on the touch screen. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4251.12s)]
*  Yeah. Everyone anyone who lives near a Sheetz knows that that's what it's worth. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4252.92s)]
*  That's what you do. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4256.88s)]
*  Kamala Harris goes into the Sheetz gas station. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4258.6s)]
*  She brings her husband and she brings Tim Walls, phony Tim Walls. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4260.28s)]
*  And they go in together. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4266.76s)]
*  And what does she shop for? A bag of Doritos. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4268.280000000001s)]
*  She's like she walks in, they're like, what are you getting? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4272.52s)]
*  What are you getting? And she's like Doritos, she says. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4274.24s)]
*  And she walks around like she has no idea where the chips are. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4277.64s)]
*  She's like staring all around the store. She has no idea. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4280.360000000001s)]
*  And her husband grabs it and she goes, oh, Dougie. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4283.56s)]
*  And she reaches and she grabs the bag, she pulls them away. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4287.96s)]
*  She says, I'll take those. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4290.16s)]
*  And she rips them out of her hand, rips, rips the Doritos out of his hands. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4291.320000000001s)]
*  And then and then cackles. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4294.92s)]
*  And she walks off. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4296.32s)]
*  Everything about it felt so completely unnatural and controlling. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4297.400000000001s)]
*  I think it's I mean, I've only been to Sheetz a few times. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4300.28s)]
*  But the one thing I remember about Sheetz, they have one of the world's [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4302.56s)]
*  second to Buc-E's, but one of the world's largest selections of chewing tobacco. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4305.96s)]
*  Every kind of dip, like ever, including like some you've never, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4310.08s)]
*  you know, pomegranate flavored or whatever. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4313.24s)]
*  I always buy a tin or two there. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4314.84s)]
*  I don't know how you could pass by the extensive snuff selection to buy Doritos. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4317.4800000000005s)]
*  Like that itself is disqualifying. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4322.92s)]
*  Yeah. And they're not even cool ranch. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4324.52s)]
*  Like they were regular Doritos. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4327.0s)]
*  Like if I'm not a Doritos person, but I know Doritos aficionados. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4328.6s)]
*  Yeah. They're all cool ranch people. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4332.400000000001s)]
*  Are they? I totally believe that. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4333.56s)]
*  The regular Doritos, like what a poser. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4334.88s)]

*  And I was like Buc-E's is the greatest because I always buy all the weird chewing tobacco there. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4398.92s)]
*  So we're wandering through Buc-E's and I get to the candy area. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4404.160000000001s)]

*  I was going and they had like a thing like malted milk balls. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4412.76s)]
*  Yeah. It was like four dollars for four pounds. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4416.04s)]
*  And I'm getting this thing and Emily comes up and takes my arm and she's like, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4419.2s)]
*  I think that's enough. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4422.76s)]

*  Impose restraint upon you. Totally do. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4431.44s)]
*  My wife was kind of rushing me out. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4433.24s)]
*  I'm like, but wait. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4434.8s)]

*  Oh, 100 percent. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4439.5199999999995s)]
*  So and I would get distracted. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4441.16s)]
*  Mesquite, barbecue, charcoal. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4442.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it just. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4444.44s)]
*  And I had my dog in the car with me. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4445.0s)]
*  We were traveling and we just this past week or so. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4446.4s)]
*  And we were we were going to, you know, when you have a dog in the car, [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4449.2s)]
*  you put a water bowl usually like outside the vehicle, like on the ground and let the dog drink. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4452.32s)]
*  And I didn't need to because Buc-E's had a water fountain for dogs. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4456.2s)]
*  Like they had a regular water fountain and right on the ground, [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4459.96s)]
*  they had a little unit for dogs so you could just get the water fountain going [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4462.04s)]
*  and the dog can drink right from there. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4465.44s)]
*  So that's that Buc-E's is the kind of capitalism we were promised. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4467.08s)]
*  Yeah. And Black Rock is the kind that we got. Right. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4472.24s)]

*  Yeah. Right. Yeah. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4479.28s)]
*  Someplace that you enjoy going that doesn't sap your soul when you're there. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4481.16s)]
*  That is interested in what you want is trying to serve you in some way. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4485.08s)]
*  Yeah. You know, is not like buying every house on your street [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4488.72s)]
*  and turning them into rentals or like really wrecking your life. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4492.08s)]
*  Well, they have a Chick-fil-A style enthusiasm. Yes. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4496.12s)]
*  So when you walk in, they say hello and they like. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4499.08s)]
*  But wasn't that the whole point of market capitalism? [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4501.400000000001s)]
*  It was going to serve what people wanted. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4503.320000000001s)]
*  It was going to respond to the needs and desires of the population. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4505.360000000001s)]

*  You know, you don't you don't want that fence. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4519.72s)]
*  What you want is density in your neighborhood. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4522.679999999999s)]
*  You want public housing on your street. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4526.28s)]
*  You want that. And if you don't want that, you're a racist. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4527.96s)]
*  Right. Right. Like, that's actually what we got. [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4530.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. We got gay race communism, but it was supposed to be Buc-E's [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4533.4s)]

*  driving through most of East Coast America. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4575.24s)]
*  I was all the way up from from Maine to Florida back and forth. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4577.76s)]

*  Well, actually, I'm I love the country. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4588.68s)]

*  And you grew up your dad was in Marine Corps or you grew up everywhere. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4593.04s)]
*  Yeah. Most of the East Coast. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4596.88s)]
*  Hawaii was our one detour away from that. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4598.280000000001s)]
*  But almost the East Coast my entire life. [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4600.76s)]
*  And the country is beautiful. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4603.08s)]
*  I love driving through it. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4606.08s)]
*  I love seeing how much you know, so much land and there's so much to drive through [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4607.64s)]
*  and really neat and cool people. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4611.320000000001s)]
*  But then, like, you see so many communities where things are [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4615.68s)]
*  like completely falling apart completely. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4618.400000000001s)]
*  And what were the signs of that? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4621.4800000000005s)]
*  Like all of the elements get through your home. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4623.92s)]

*  If there's a hole in your roof, you're impoverished. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4646.48s)]
*  Yeah. We can say that your house is leaning over. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4648.839999999999s)]

*  Like you live in a death trap. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4654.24s)]
*  So, yeah, there's a lot of that out there. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4656.08s)]
*  And should you if you and I saw, by the way, in a lot of those yards, I saw Trump flex [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4659.44s)]
*  as a political measure. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4664.879999999999s)]
*  So we're paying for the pensions that were guaranteed [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4666.08s)]
*  retirement of bureaucrats in the Ukraine who work for the corrupt government [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4670.32s)]
*  of Ukraine run by the anti-American, anti-Christian Zelensky. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4675.2s)]
*  We're paying the retirement. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4679.76s)]

*  Really? Yeah. [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4688.04s)]

*  I had a piece a while ago about this, and I keep notes every day [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4693.16s)]
*  from my radio show. And I remember I shared this on the air [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4695.52s)]
*  that we were paying, I think, subsidies to keep small businesses open in Ukraine. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4698.200000000001s)]
*  So, yeah, we're paying for everything. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4702.120000000001s)]
*  So grotesque. It's hard to metabolize it. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4703.88s)]
*  But you drove through our own country in the last two weeks. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4706.8s)]
*  And you see people who don't have patched roofs. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4710.76s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4714.160000000001s)]
*  And so, like, the country's not doing well is is an understatement. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4717.280000000001s)]
*  And there's lots of people who are suffering. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4722.4400000000005s)]
*  And that's why, you know, we kind of glanced off of the economic discussion earlier. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4724.48s)]
*  But I really think it matters that we are at a point right now [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4727.879999999999s)]
*  where the country is at over a trillion dollars in credit card debt. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4731.28s)]
*  This is this is a record. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4734.919999999999s)]
*  We've never had this much credit card debt in our nation's history. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4736.0s)]
*  And credit card debt is totally destructive. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4739.48s)]
*  You're looking at, you know, 16, 18, 20, 22, 25 percent rates. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4743.16s)]
*  Yeah, close to 30. Yeah. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4746.759999999999s)]
*  On these. And that means, you know, people are being destroyed [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4748.2s)]
*  and they can't make ends meet. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4753.240000000001s)]
*  The unemployment numbers are all a scam. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4754.52s)]
*  Would that really? Can I just ask, like, we used to put people in prison [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4756.400000000001s)]
*  back when the mafia was offering loans at lower interest rates than those. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4759.88s)]
*  Yeah. Ursary. Yeah. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4763.52s)]
*  That the yeah. Usury and loan sharking, we called it. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4765.16s)]
*  Yeah. And all these sort of nice Italian guys wind up in jail. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4768.52s)]
*  Yeah. But it's cool when the credit card companies do that. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4773.400000000001s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4776.52s)]
*  Joe Biden. Yeah, you're right. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4778.64s)]
*  Yes. Joe Biden, the senator from Delaware, making that happen. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4780.52s)]
*  The NBA. Yeah. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4783.160000000001s)]
*  That that's how that works. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4784.88s)]
*  But people are in massive amounts of debt and the unemployment [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4786.92s)]
*  numbers are a scam because really what they represent is that there are people [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4789.4800000000005s)]
*  working multiple part time jobs to make ends meet. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4793.0s)]
*  That's what that means. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4795.76s)]
*  So all this stuff about like unemployment is slow. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4796.76s)]
*  No, it's not. People are working multiple jobs in order to pay [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4798.6s)]
*  for just how expensive their lives are. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4802.88s)]
*  And all the employment gains have been among immigrants. All of them. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4804.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Zero net. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4807.0s)]
*  I mean, net zero gains among native born. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4808.32s)]
*  Native Americans losing jobs. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4811.8s)]
*  Immigrants, foreign born workers gaining all. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4814.04s)]
*  So it's you know, my cousin, E.J. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4816.76s)]
*  Antony is I think the single best economist on this subject. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4819.32s)]
*  Yes. And he's just been amazing on it. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4822.360000000001s)]
*  And and he's done all of the available evidence demonstrates he's right. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4823.76s)]
*  And no American needs a government report to tell them that they're miserable, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4828.08s)]
*  by the way, whether the media sort of waits for unemployment reports to tell. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4831.04s)]
*  Like Don Lemon, like telling you, you shouldn't be miserable. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4834.0s)]
*  No, the data says that you're not miserable. You're fine. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4836.04s)]
*  Like what those all of that government stuff is one cooked into a trailing [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4839.2s)]
*  indicator of what's actually happening. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4843.64s)]
*  But a drive from where did you go? [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4846.4s)]
*  Like you went from where to where in the United States? [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4848.84s)]
*  I was so I was in from Greenville, Maine was as far north as I was. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4851.0s)]
*  Great place. All the way to southwest Florida. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4855.88s)]
*  Wow. Yeah. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4859.12s)]
*  And so I got to see a bunch of places I was in. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4860.36s)]
*  That was in the Atlanta area. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4863.32s)]
*  I went to and you drove that whole way. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4864.64s)]
*  I flew some of it at the beginning and then I drove most of it. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4867.0s)]
*  I drove in order to get to Maine. I flew into Boston. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4870.320000000001s)]
*  I drove the four and a half hours, whatever it is, to Greenville. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4872.8s)]
*  I was in Atlanta. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4877.6s)]
*  I was driving in the Atlanta suburbs. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4879.4400000000005s)]
*  I went to southwest Florida, drove all the way up past Tampa, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4881.92s)]
*  went to Jacksonville, Florida, drove from there, went to coastal North Carolina, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4886.92s)]
*  drove from there back to Washington, D.C. [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4890.56s)]
*  And I flew to be here with you. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4893.08s)]
*  And so get to see a lot of places. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4895.4s)]
*  And like I said, it's a beautiful country, but it's disturbing [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4898.2s)]
*  how much of it is in disrepair. [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4902.88s)]
*  And like you just think to yourself, [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4905.0s)]
*  you it is a part of you that's like, I don't know what you could possibly do [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4907.96s)]
*  to get things back on track. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4912.2s)]
*  I was I don't fly very much at all. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4915.96s)]
*  I try not to travel at all. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4918.76s)]
*  But I've taken a couple of flights recently, commercial flights, [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4921.8s)]
*  and I'm shocked by the airports. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4926.16s)]
*  And I'm shocked by how disorganized they are. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4930.16s)]
*  The TSA screening, I don't remember it being that bad. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4934.72s)]
*  I've taken about four years off from really flying that much. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4937.5199999999995s)]
*  And and then I thought to myself, wow, I didn't know how degrading and stupid this was. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4941.28s)]
*  I'd forgotten how degrading and stupid it was. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4947.68s)]
*  And then I thought, you know, the people making decisions about the way [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4949.56s)]
*  this country is run, like they don't have any contact with us. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4953.400000000001s)]
*  There's no there's no donor to either party who flies commercial. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4956.080000000001s)]
*  Nobody flies commercial with money in this country. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4959.92s)]
*  It's crazy. I grew up in a rich area in a world of rich people. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4962.280000000001s)]
*  Everyone flew commercial. Nobody had a plane. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4966.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, nobody. Now everybody flies private. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4968.080000000001s)]
*  It's crazy. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4971.080000000001s)]
*  And one of the effects of that is people who are making these decisions [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4972.4400000000005s)]
*  were paying for these politicians. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4976.04s)]
*  They just don't know. They don't see it at all. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4978.56s)]
*  And they definitely don't drive, you know, from Tampa to coastal [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4980.4800000000005s)]
*  North Carolina and then D.C. They just don't. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4984.4400000000005s)]
*  Do you think that has some effect? [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4986.68s)]
*  That is a huge bearing. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4988.320000000001s)]
*  I mean, look, TSA conditions the rest of us to be compliant. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4989.72s)]
*  I mean, that's like so if that's not your experience, you kind of feel. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4993.320000000001s)]
*  What is the facial that you stare into a camera? [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=4997.04s)]
*  This happened to me yesterday. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5000.56s)]
*  I had to fly yesterday or two days ago. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5001.64s)]
*  And they're like, will you look into that? [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5004.360000000001s)]
*  I was like, no, thank you. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5005.68s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5006.68s)]
*  But you don't have to. Like, what is that? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5007.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. I know I'm showing how out of touch I am. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5010.16s)]
*  I just don't travel very much. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5012.52s)]
*  It's just security theater. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5013.6s)]
*  And like, you know, what is first of all, what is the ID checker assessing? [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5014.52s)]
*  What are they doing? [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5018.200000000001s)]
*  Like a compelling background check on you or something that, you know, [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5018.64s)]
*  what's your history of terrorism? [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5021.84s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing is really stupid and degrading and super annoying. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5023.360000000001s)]
*  Like, why am I standing on line to get on a flight? [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5027.92s)]
*  It was all 9-11. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5030.6s)]
*  George W. Bush created all of this right after 9-11. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5031.400000000001s)]
*  And we had to because there was an imminent threat. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5033.92s)]
*  And we were under attack by terrorists. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5036.36s)]
*  And then you fast forward 23 years later and the Taliban still run Afghanistan. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5038.32s)]
*  They're way better armed with our money. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5043.24s)]
*  Their infrastructure is much better because we built it. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5045.28s)]
*  And they're still in charge. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5048.12s)]
*  And we're left in this decaying country with fewer civil liberties, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5049.6s)]
*  having to be humiliated at the freaking airport. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5053.32s)]
*  Like, why shouldn't we see all the 9-11 documents? [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5056.36s)]
*  Like, why? Why? [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5060.72s)]
*  You know, if anything justifies another January 6th, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5062.08s)]
*  which is to say people just like moving up to the Capitol and demanding something, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5065.12s)]
*  why wouldn't it be seeing those documents? [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5069.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5071.24s)]
*  That event changed this country profoundly and forever. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5071.6s)]
*  Yes. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5074.8s)]
*  We're its citizens. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5075.16s)]
*  We pay for it. It's being done in our name. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5076.16s)]
*  And we can't know what exactly happened because why? [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5077.52s)]
*  And it's changed in really stupid, tyrannical and artificial ways. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5081.32s)]
*  So it predictable ways. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5084.28s)]
*  So like like TSA doesn't catch anything. Right. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5085.44s)]
*  So they do their annual screenings where they like practice like, [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5088.0s)]
*  will you catch the weapons that we put through? [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5090.32s)]
*  They put actual weapons through the X-ray machines. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5092.32s)]
*  And the TSA agents don't catch them. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5095.08s)]
*  They have their fail rate is astronomical. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5097.12s)]
*  Really? Yeah. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5099.6s)]
*  So they're not actually even catching the things that they're tested on. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5100.28s)]
*  And we're all subjected to do this as if it's keeping us safe, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5104.76s)]
*  which, of course, it isn't. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5107.6s)]
*  Why are we doing this? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5109.08s)]
*  Like, I would settle for if you want to make one modification, [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5110.16s)]
*  locks on the cockpit door. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5113.04s)]
*  Totally fine. I'm good with that. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5114.64s)]
*  Beyond that, why are we doing the rest of this? [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5116.32s)]
*  I'm willing to take the risk. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5118.2s)]
*  I am. I'd rather live in that world. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5119.76s)]
*  It's a happier world. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5122.08s)]
*  It's more spiritually compelling. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5123.56s)]
*  And it demonstrates, you know, like a cohesive society. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5126.280000000001s)]
*  You don't need that. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5129.52s)]
*  And in fact, the more they make the society more chaotic, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5130.72s)]
*  the more they justify all of this, you know, the more that they [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5135.56s)]
*  they import incompatible cultures and, you know, make everyone live in squalor. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5138.4400000000005s)]
*  Like eventually they're increasing social distrust so much [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5144.280000000001s)]
*  that they're offering a justification for the system that that's right. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5147.0s)]
*  It's self-licking ice cream cone. Yeah. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5150.72s)]
*  What happens at the Democratic National Convention this week? [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5154.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to be a big demonstration. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5157.88s)]
*  If you're clear thinking about this, if you stare at it and [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5161.6s)]
*  you're just like objective, what you're going to witness is chaos. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5164.92s)]
*  You're witnessing. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5169.76s)]
*  First of all, why are they doing it in Chicago? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5171.080000000001s)]
*  And like, what world do you appeal to the broad American middle [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5173.56s)]
*  by having a Democrat convention in Chicago, Illinois? [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5178.360000000001s)]
*  Because none of us can ever during the course of our lifetimes [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5181.32s)]
*  escape the year 1968. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5184.6s)]
*  Everything is in reference to that year. Yeah. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5187.68s)]
*  And so I just why not? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5190.72s)]
*  I mean, they should have another march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, too. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5192.96s)]
*  I mean, everything is like. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5195.56s)]
*  Everything is a replay of that period. It's weird. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5197.88s)]
*  Yeah. And so now Kamala Harris is the nominee. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5200.64s)]
*  Amazingly, by the way, this whole convention is fake [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5203.92s)]
*  because she was made the nominee weeks ago in secret [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5206.64s)]
*  in an online vote. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5210.280000000001s)]
*  So this whole thing is like a scam. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5211.96s)]
*  Everything about it is a facade. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5214.52s)]
*  Even the votes are fake because the votes were taken weeks ago. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5216.400000000001s)]
*  Yes. All to foreclose on the obvious chaos is going to happen anyway. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5219.04s)]
*  We're already seeing it. That's right. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5222.200000000001s)]
*  I mean, like and this is, you know, God, I want Republicans [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5223.92s)]
*  to be so much better than they are. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5228.76s)]
*  But insofar as they exist now, the way they do, Milwaukee was like. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5229.88s)]
*  Placid. Yeah, it was peaceful. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5234.4800000000005s)]
*  It was orderly. Yeah, it was compelling. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5236.8s)]
*  It was great. Great speakers. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5238.84s)]
*  I mean, you were there. You saw it. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5240.2s)]
*  You had better billing than Joe Biden does. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5241.400000000001s)]
*  I didn't think that I wasn't planning to go, actually, at all. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5243.6s)]
*  I didn't want to go. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5248.6s)]
*  I've been to every convention since 96. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5249.52s)]
*  I didn't want to go to any more conventions. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5252.12s)]
*  They asked me to speak. I wasn't going to do it. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5254.16s)]
*  And I was like, I should do that and make myself do it. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5256.08s)]
*  I loved it. I had like the best time ever. Yeah. Why? [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5258.52s)]
*  Because I like the vibe. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5263.08s)]
*  I like the people. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5264.76s)]
*  I mean, obviously, I've been around it my whole life. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5266.08s)]
*  So I saw everyone I've ever met was there. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5268.0s)]
*  But also, I just I thought it was a happy, happy, happy time. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5269.76s)]
*  And I think it really Trump survived getting shot in the face. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5275.8s)]
*  And that is motivating. Yeah. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5280.08s)]
*  I mean, that just changed everything. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5282.96s)]
*  I know it feels like that was 40 years ago, but it was [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5285.08s)]
*  that's month that that happened. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5289.52s)]
*  It was it was just it was happy. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5293.04s)]
*  Anyway, it was a great time, I thought. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5295.08s)]
*  So they always tell you it's the most important election of your lifetime. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5297.12s)]
*  But of course, this one actually is that's demonstrable. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5299.92s)]
*  And it's also because it is so important being censored at every level by the tech companies. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5303.08s)]
*  So we were thinking about this a couple of months ago, and we thought, [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5307.92s)]
*  why not get on the road live in front of actual people, live audiences [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5309.92s)]
*  coast to coast and nationwide tour where we can't be censored? [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5314.8s)]
*  That'd be good. It would also be fun. So we're doing it. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5318.5199999999995s)]
*  We're going to be on stage with some of our friends, some of the most [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5320.84s)]
*  fascinating people we know, the most recognizable people we know, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5323.48s)]
*  responding to what is happening in America this September in real time. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5326.28s)]
*  It'll be just like the podcast, but it's going to be live. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5332.0s)]
*  So we're excited to announce our friend Larry Elder is coming to join us [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5334.72s)]
*  in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, our friend John Rich will be there with us in Sunrise, Florida. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5338.32s)]
*  We're adding more stops. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5342.88s)]
*  You said at another stadium show in Reading, Pennsylvania, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5343.8s)]
*  we'll be joined on stage by Alex Jones. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5347.04s)]
*  They tell you what Alex Jones is like. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5349.44s)]
*  Have you seen him in person? You should make up your own mind. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5350.96s)]
*  It's going to be fun as hell and interesting and intense. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5354.36s)]
*  And we hope you will join us. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5357.68s)]
*  Go to Tucker Carlson dot com right now to get your tickets. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5359.44s)]
*  See you there. After Trump got shot, I realized I liked him more. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5362.6s)]
*  Yeah. And my views about him became less complex. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5367.56s)]
*  I agree. Did you have the same sense? [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5370.44s)]
*  Like, like, in other words, like, I always try and maintain some objective distance. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5372.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, yes, I don't like about this guy. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5376.44s)]
*  I wish he would do this differently. I wish he didn't do that. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5378.0s)]
*  I wish you hired better people, whatever, whatever criticism you want to level [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5379.76s)]
*  against him. And and by the way, you should, as you're right, as an American to do that, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5382.48s)]
*  because the end goal should be to make him better. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5386.28s)]
*  And Trump is the rare politician who actually does listen to people, [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5388.44s)]
*  no matter their station in life, no matter where they come from. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5391.36s)]
*  He's actually interested in what you think. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5393.4s)]
*  So that's a good sign. He'll he'll actually change when given advice. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5395.04s)]
*  But my views about him became less complex after that. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5399.5199999999995s)]
*  I was like, I really like this guy. I agree. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5403.32s)]
*  Legitimately, I agree, because what he displayed was unusual [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5405.48s)]
*  and aspirational. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5410.88s)]
*  Did you feel like that? [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5413.679999999999s)]
*  I felt that way really strongly. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5414.799999999999s)]
*  I hate complaining. [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5416.36s)]
*  I don't think men should complain. I really mean that. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5418.48s)]
*  It's one of my core beliefs. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5421.2s)]
*  That's how I was raised. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5422.24s)]
*  And I will never shake that belief, that conviction that, you know, stop complaining. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5423.12s)]
*  Like, what did you think this was? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5428.84s)]
*  And I will never not admire physical courage. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5430.92s)]
*  I just admire that. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5434.599999999999s)]
*  And I want to have it myself. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5436.36s)]
*  I don't know if I do. I haven't been tested very often in my life, [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5438.68s)]
*  but I would like to think that if I was ever shot [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5441.04s)]
*  in the way that Trump was, that I would behave as manfully as he did. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5444.88s)]
*  I don't know that I would. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5449.8s)]
*  You can't know. But he did. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5452.160000000001s)]
*  He was tested in a way that was very meaningful to me, [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5454.08s)]
*  leaving aside the politics. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5457.360000000001s)]
*  But like all of a sudden you're talking and bang, you can hit with something. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5458.4800000000005s)]
*  It's clearly a bullet. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5462.56s)]
*  You don't know if you're dead or not. Yes. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5464.200000000001s)]
*  And then you stand up and... [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5466.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5470.240000000001s)]
*  I just, that's the acid test for me, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5470.76s)]
*  because it really matters what you're like as a person. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5473.56s)]
*  It matters to me. I'm not a Democrat. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5476.360000000001s)]
*  I don't care about your stupid party. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5478.280000000001s)]
*  And it's the point of the exercise is not to huddle together for increased power, [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5480.4800000000005s)]
*  because I don't feel powerless as a person. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5486.52s)]
*  Right. I have a family. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5488.360000000001s)]
*  I don't need a party to make me feel whole, unlike liberals. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5489.6s)]
*  And so what really matters to me is what you're like. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5494.24s)]
*  And do you have virtue? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5497.599999999999s)]
*  And Trump is a mixed bag on that question, but part of virtue is bravery. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5499.8s)]
*  It's a big part of virtue, actually. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5506.24s)]
*  It turns out much bigger than I understood as a younger man. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5507.96s)]
*  And he's brave, like actually brave, not fake brave. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5510.88s)]
*  Oh, he's so brave. Oh, they're so courageous. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5514.72s)]
*  Kamala is so courageous. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5516.96s)]
*  She's a coward. She's terrified. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5519.08s)]
*  She's clearly terrified. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5520.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5522.16s)]
*  And he's not. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5523.16s)]
*  And that like, OK, I'm voting for the guy who's brave over the coward. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5524.16s)]
*  Yeah. And on Trump being a mixed bag in terms of like virtue and things, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5528.44s)]
*  I always remember. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5532.28s)]
*  Let me just say I'm a mixed bag on virtue. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5533.96s)]
*  We all are. Right. So I thought, OK. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5535.639999999999s)]
*  In fact, that's a Christian admission. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5537.8s)]
*  And well, it's a true admission. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5539.16s)]
*  Here's the thing. I always think about my dad, who you mentioned is a Marine Corps [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5541.0s)]
*  officer, and at one point he worked very closely, as you do, with the chaplain in [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5546.36s)]
*  his unit, a guy, great American, who has the same name twice. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5550.8s)]
*  His name is Allen Allen, Chaplain Allen Allen. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5554.4400000000005s)]
*  And he's a great human being. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5556.96s)]
*  And my dad was once complaining to him about various chaplains in the military [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5559.12s)]
*  and how some of them are not so impressive and he wishes they were better and more [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5563.92s)]
*  Christian and more and have more virtue and that kind of thing. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5567.2s)]
*  And he said, he said, Vinny, I think they were the same rank. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5569.8s)]
*  He said, Vinny, remember, Jesus chose 12 centers to follow him. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5574.96s)]
*  That's right. 12 centers. [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5580.0s)]
*  And he was right about that. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5581.72s)]
*  And I always keep that in mind. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5584.28s)]
*  It's like before I like start judging other people for their moral families. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5585.68s)]
*  I agree. Like like the people who were tasked with advancing the greatest message [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5588.92s)]
*  humanity's ever known were failed, were had immense failings. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5594.4800000000005s)]
*  Paul, Paul murdered Christians. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5598.84s)]
*  Yes. And Peter was a coward. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5601.32s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, it's just denied Jesus three times as predicted because he was too afraid. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5603.76s)]
*  Yeah. I agree completely. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5609.0s)]
*  The most important apostle. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5611.12s)]
*  So they choose, they just, you know, God chooses unusual vehicles. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5612.32s)]
*  I think, I think that's right. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5615.52s)]
*  And I just in a, in a time where, you know, reality itself is hard to identify [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5617.24s)]
*  or even define, you know, in a digital world, in an AI world, it's hard to know what is real. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5625.76s)]
*  Everyone is struggling with this. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5632.84s)]
*  One thing that is absolutely real is that when you're shot in the face unexpectedly, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5634.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5639.080000000001s)]
*  we can see something deep about who you are. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5640.080000000001s)]
*  And we saw Trump live on camera. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5644.52s)]
*  We saw something about him that was just remarkable. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5646.6s)]
*  It was absolutely remarkable. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5648.92s)]
*  It was animal. It was like in a good way. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5650.280000000001s)]
*  It was, it was just like, he just, it was great. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5652.040000000001s)]
*  It was totally great. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5654.72s)]
*  And I must say, I talked to him that night and the night he was shot, that Saturday night, maybe. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5655.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. I think. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5660.320000000001s)]
*  And I was in Maine, but I talked to him and he didn't, I mean, he didn't mention anything about himself. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5661.8s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5668.6s)]
*  I mean, look, I'm not flacking for Trump, but this is just a fact. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5669.360000000001s)]
*  It was, did you see the crowd? [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5673.92s)]
*  They were so brave. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5676.68s)]
*  They didn't run. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5678.16s)]
*  That's the first thing he said. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5679.08s)]
*  I was like, wow. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5680.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5682.360000000001s)]
*  They also saved his life because the people who were outside the perimeter, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5682.88s)]
*  who began shouting up about Thomas Crooks being on the roof, the Trump supporters, [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5687.72s)]
*  they were the only ones who were raising the loud alarm about what was happening. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5692.320000000001s)]
*  And they were the predicate to that cop getting his head over the roof and scaring Thomas Crooks into taking action at that moment. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5695.88s)]
*  It's so perfect though. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5702.8s)]
*  It's like only the Trump voters are willing to notice the obvious. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5703.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5707.12s)]
*  They haven't been trained to deny what their senses perceive. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5707.6s)]
*  No. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5710.280000000001s)]
*  In fact, their senses are- [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5711.04s)]
*  Wait, there's a guy on the roof with a gun. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5711.84s)]
*  What? [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5714.08s)]
*  In fact, their senses are elevated to the peril. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5714.48s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's right. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5718.0s)]
*  And they can smell it. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5718.799999999999s)]
*  And so it's not just some looky-loo who's up on the roof just trying to see what's going on on the stage. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5720.599999999999s)]
*  They're worried about Trump's safety and they're yelling out, he's on the roof. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5726.0s)]
*  He's on the roof, officer. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5729.5599999999995s)]
*  They're screaming. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5731.4s)]
*  They saved Trump's life. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5732.16s)]
*  Every element of that, I know we keep returning to this, but it's such an amazing moment in history. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5733.759999999999s)]
*  It is amazing. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5737.719999999999s)]
*  Every element of it conspired to save him. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5738.959999999999s)]
*  Every element of it, from the people shouting, the cop getting his head above the roof, [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5742.08s)]
*  the frenzied rush to take the shot by Thomas Crooks as a result, Trump's head turned towards a chart, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5747.0s)]
*  Tang moments before, take me off teleprompter, I don't even care, I'm going to do the chart. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5752.92s)]
*  And just all of those things, they conspired in a way that can only be divine, [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5757.0s)]
*  that can only be the product of divine intervention. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5762.84s)]
*  It's- [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5765.84s)]
*  And I saw that and it's one- [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5766.4s)]
*  So I had simpler views about Trump after that, and I had more grateful views about God after that. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5767.92s)]
*  I agree with both those things. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5772.36s)]
*  And his, I talk about myself way too much as it is, but I try not to, [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5774.16s)]
*  because I think it's such an unattractive, the most unattractive quality in a man. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5780.12s)]
*  But I think if I was shot, like he was shot, I'd be like talking about myself, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5785.28s)]
*  like, oh, I can't believe I got shot. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5790.04s)]
*  And Trump, who's like famously, everyone's like, Trump's such a narcissist. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5792.28s)]
*  At least when I talked to him, he didn't mention himself. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5796.68s)]
*  It was only about the audience. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5798.72s)]
*  Yeah, wow. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5800.12s)]
*  And there's no one else listening to this conversation, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5800.96s)]
*  well, other than obviously NSA is listening to it. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5802.8s)]
*  Besides them, yeah. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5805.08s)]
*  Besides the criminals. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5806.0s)]
*  But anyway, but he's not doing it for an audience, just me, no expectation, I'll repeat it. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5808.16s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5813.32s)]
*  And he didn't mention himself, it's only about the other people. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5814.04s)]
*  And I thought, man, I just thought it was so revealing, it was in a way that's not fakeable. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5816.64s)]
*  You know, AI didn't do that. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5822.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's cool. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5823.76s)]
*  And then you talked about that at the convention. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5824.8s)]
*  I did. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5826.92s)]
*  Which was cool. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5827.76s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that was the substance of your remarks talking about what he was like. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5828.6s)]
*  Oh, like, I guess. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5833.0s)]
*  I ad libbed that speech, so I have. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5834.72s)]
*  Yeah, I have no memory. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5836.08s)]
*  You don't have any memory? [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5837.76s)]
*  So I guess it renders moot the following question. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5839.2s)]
*  I wonder, is there any point, do you ever give a speech [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5841.280000000001s)]
*  where you feel the gravity of it, or are you at the point [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5843.68s)]
*  where you're so used to giving speeches that even speaking [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5845.76s)]
*  on the Republican convention stage with every network [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5849.84s)]
*  in the United States concentrated on your remarks, [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5852.16s)]
*  Oh, I felt the gravity of it. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5855.360000000001s)]
*  Well, in the sense that they told me to write a speech. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5857.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm a writer, I can, I've certainly written a lot, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5860.120000000001s)]
*  but I don't write speeches the one thing I, [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5863.8s)]
*  I just don't write speeches I never have one time in my life. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5865.52s)]
*  But I felt like, well, I wanna be the obedient little bitch [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5868.84s)]
*  or whatever I wanna do what I'm told, I guess. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5872.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5874.8s)]
*  I knew you weren't gonna write it. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5875.64s)]
*  I knew it. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5876.4800000000005s)]
*  I actually. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5877.320000000001s)]
*  I knew it. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5878.160000000001s)]
*  In fact, I told, as soon as I heard that you were giving a address, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5879.0s)]
*  I said, he's not gonna write it. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5880.88s)]
*  He's just gonna do it. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5881.92s)]
*  Well, I made a good faith effort and I, [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5882.88s)]
*  there was no sauna at my hotel. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5886.52s)]
*  So I said, I can't write obviously without my sauna. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5888.12s)]
*  But I did actually spend like eight hours fretting about it [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5890.84s)]
*  and trying to write it on my iPhone. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5894.32s)]
*  And then I was like, I can't write a speech for myself. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5896.52s)]
*  I could write a speech for someone else, but. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5899.68s)]
*  I gotta say. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5901.76s)]
*  Whatever, I'm not going to, so I didn't. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5902.64s)]
*  I guess, I know you're a good writer, obviously, [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5904.08s)]
*  like your whole career has been writing. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5906.24s)]
*  Even when you were on television, I would laugh at people [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5908.2s)]
*  and be like, I wish Chuck, we're back to writing. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5910.16s)]
*  I'm like, I don't think you're familiar with what he's doing [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5911.84s)]
*  on a daily basis, literally writing all the time. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5914.360000000001s)]
*  I just knew that you wouldn't do it because it's just, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5916.88s)]
*  I don't know, maybe it's your ego. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5920.400000000001s)]
*  Like you're gonna give this speech off teleprompter [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5921.4800000000005s)]
*  and you're just gonna say what's on your mind. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5923.6s)]
*  And I knew kind of reflexively, there's no, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5925.2s)]
*  this is the one venue. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5927.32s)]
*  It's just, honestly, I kind of thought like, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5929.04s)]
*  you're just like, no, screw you, I'm not doing a speech. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5932.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm not writing a speech. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5934.52s)]
*  Well, ultimately I said that in a much more polite way [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5935.6s)]
*  to all the staff at the really nice people [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5938.64s)]
*  who are doing the run through and whatever. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5943.4400000000005s)]
*  And I was like, I just can't do this. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5945.96s)]
*  No, I don't like to write speeches [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5948.4400000000005s)]
*  because then you don't learn anything. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5949.84s)]
*  There's something about speaking in conversation or, [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5952.400000000001s)]
*  I really believe that words have, [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5956.360000000001s)]
*  loose stated words, spoken words have like spiritual power. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  In the beginning was the word and the word was with God [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5967.08s)]
*  and the word was God. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5969.08s)]
*  Like, what does that even mean? [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5969.919999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure what it means. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5970.759999999999s)]
*  I mean, the word, I guess is Jesus, [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5972.08s)]
*  but it's beginning of John. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5973.28s)]
*  But there's something about, we tell the truth. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5975.719999999999s)]
*  We don't just know the truth or believe the truth. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5978.28s)]
*  We tell the truth. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5980.04s)]
*  There's something about using the one thing that we have [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5980.879999999999s)]
*  that the rest of the animal kingdom doesn't have, [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5984.799999999999s)]
*  which is the power of speech that makes things real [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5986.5199999999995s)]
*  and that gives them power. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5990.04s)]
*  Anyway, I find that when I talk, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5991.48s)]
*  I think everyone finds this, if you think about it, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5994.76s)]
*  that saying something out loud allows you [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=5997.4400000000005s)]
*  to understand things, like you learn. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6000.38s)]
*  In other words, we think of language as something [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6003.4800000000005s)]
*  that we use to inform or educate others. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6006.360000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna tell you something. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6008.8s)]
*  I do it for a living. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6009.76s)]
*  I hear my views. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6010.6s)]
*  But what we miss is that we're being educated too. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6012.360000000001s)]
*  Like we're learning. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6016.4800000000005s)]
*  The speaker is learning as he speaks. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6017.360000000001s)]
*  Well, do you ever experience this? [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6019.280000000001s)]
*  Words have immense power, for sure. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6020.96s)]
*  For the reasons you just laid out. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6024.44s)]
*  But they change the speaker, not just the listener. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6025.28s)]
*  And they, yeah. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6027.32s)]
*  And especially like, when you repeat something over and over, [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6029.56s)]
*  it establishes a groove in your mind [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6032.32s)]
*  so that you kind of can draw upon it to use it again. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6033.84s)]
*  So speaking is very helpful in that way. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6037.36s)]
*  Repetition is a good way to learn anything. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6040.36s)]
*  But if you're deprived of the tools, it's disorienting. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6042.52s)]
*  And it leaves you- What does that mean? [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6046.28s)]
*  Meaning like the left's current program, [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6047.84s)]
*  which has been a program for a while [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6051.6s)]
*  that many of us were late to detect. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6052.96s)]
*  Shut up racist. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6054.88s)]
*  Was to change language in such a way. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6055.76s)]
*  Yeah. Shut up racist [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6058.16s)]
*  is a perfect example. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6059.12s)]
*  To change language in such a way [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6060.4s)]
*  that you can't even think clearly about what's going on. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6061.76s)]
*  That reality is so distorted by your lack of vocabulary [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6064.72s)]
*  that, or by your distorted vocabulary, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6068.8s)]
*  that you're incapable of resolving the problem. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6071.8s)]
*  You can smell that there's a problem, [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6074.56s)]
*  but you don't actually know how to navigate out of it. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6075.88s)]
*  This is like gender affirming care [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6077.92s)]
*  is a perfect example of that. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6079.56s)]
*  Gender affirming. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6081.24s)]
*  First of all, it's already a lie [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6083.72s)]
*  because it's establishing that your body is a mistake [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6084.56s)]
*  and that what is correct is for you to mutilate it. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6089.64s)]
*  Like, it's like, what? [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6093.2s)]
*  We're just affirming something [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6095.08s)]
*  that preexisted in this decision. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6095.92s)]
*  And you scare people into compliance [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6097.88s)]
*  and then they begin to lose the vocabulary necessary [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6099.4400000000005s)]
*  to untangle it, right? [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6102.4400000000005s)]
*  Orwell wrote about this at length. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6104.28s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6105.8s)]
*  And he was the best at writing about it. [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6107.0s)]
*  And that's why it matters so much [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6109.360000000001s)]
*  because it's mind control. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6111.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6112.96s)]
*  Words are mind control. [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6113.8s)]
*  100%. [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6114.64s)]
*  And the ability to speak to an audience [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6115.4800000000005s)]
*  and then to, first of all, learn for yourself, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6118.8s)]
*  but also to detect what they're actually picking up [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6121.08s)]
*  is a skill that you have for sure, [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6124.28s)]
*  and it's made you successful. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6127.04s)]
*  It's a skill that Kamala Harris does not have. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6128.56s)]
*  That's the skill she doesn't have. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6131.24s)]
*  She doesn't have that skill. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6132.72s)]
*  She can't do it. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6133.88s)]
*  She can't talk to an audience [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6134.92s)]
*  and see that they're receiving her. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6136.04s)]
*  She doesn't know what they're receiving. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6137.56s)]
*  She can't read their body language. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6138.8s)]
*  She doesn't know how to change her tone. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6140.4s)]
*  Have you ever noticed she tells these jokes, [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6143.12s)]
*  nobody laughs, and then she cackles to herself? [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6144.32s)]
*  Yes. [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6146.0s)]
*  It's because she isn't able to connect on a human level [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6146.839999999999s)]
*  because she's not all that interested [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6149.44s)]
*  in what they're saying through their expressions, [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6151.32s)]
*  through their reactions. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6153.32s)]
*  Well, she's certainly missing out [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6154.32s)]
*  on one of life's greatest and richest experiences, [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6155.679999999999s)]
*  which is to feel the vibe of other people. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6158.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6161.2s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of the only reason to be alive really. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6162.04s)]
*  And it's like the most beautiful, great, fun thing ever [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6165.04s)]
*  and speaking in public is the easiest thing you could ever do. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6171.08s)]
*  You just can't worry about it. [[01:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6174.5199999999995s)]
*  And as long as you don't worry about it, [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6176.0s)]
*  like everyone would be great at it actually, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6177.32s)]
*  including Kamala Harris. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6178.839999999999s)]
*  And when I don't know her, I've never even met her. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6180.799999999999s)]
*  I have relatives who know her actually. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6183.679999999999s)]
*  You know, they say she's kind of amusing. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6186.16s)]
*  They don't hate her. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6188.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6189.5199999999995s)]
*  But she's obviously terrified. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6190.4s)]
*  She's obviously afraid. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6193.2s)]
*  I look at her, I'm like, ooh, you're afraid. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6194.599999999999s)]
*  She's scared to death. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6196.04s)]
*  She's scared to death. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6196.879999999999s)]
*  That's the first thing I register when I see her. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6197.719999999999s)]
*  That woman is afraid [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6201.12s)]
*  because she knows that she's fraudulent. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6201.96s)]
*  Like a caged animal that will hurt someone. [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6203.639999999999s)]
*  She's a fascist, no doubt. [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6206.0s)]
*  No one ever mentions that. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6208.48s)]
*  Biden just had 50 years of life in Washington, [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6211.5199999999995s)]
*  kind of the precedent of how things are done [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6215.759999999999s)]
*  in a restrained Republic kind of seeped into him. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6218.759999999999s)]
*  She's coming from a different world. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6223.12s)]
*  She's coming from California, which is post-political. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6224.639999999999s)]
*  It's a one-party state. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6227.16s)]
*  And she has no problem using force at all. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6228.88s)]
*  And all the fascists around her are the same. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6232.28s)]
*  So, no, but I just feel, I do feel sorry for commoners. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6234.5199999999995s)]
*  Again, I don't know where I'm just making these judgments [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6237.599999999999s)]
*  on the basis of watching her, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6239.68s)]
*  but I feel like this is someone who can't admit [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6240.8s)]
*  who she really is, what she really thinks [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6244.08s)]
*  and is really, really afraid. [[01:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6248.28s)]
*  And you feel sorry for people like that. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6249.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6251.08s)]
*  Which is why I loved Trump [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6251.92s)]
*  at the National Association for Black Journalists. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6254.12s)]
*  I don't think you're allowed to love that. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6257.88s)]
*  I loved it. I supposed to disapprove. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6259.16s)]
*  I adored it. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6260.24s)]
*  And here's why. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6261.08s)]
*  Tell me. [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6262.64s)]
*  So think about the weeks leading up to that. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6263.4800000000005s)]
*  The weeks leading up to it put the Trump campaign [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6265.6s)]
*  on its heels, because one, the narrative was so disrupted [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6267.92s)]
*  by the fact that they just replaced Joe with Kamala. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6271.4s)]
*  And then the media went all in on selling her. [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6273.88s)]
*  It's like, she's so great. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6275.92s)]
*  She's wonderful. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6276.76s)]
*  It's all about joy, Vince. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6277.84s)]
*  And then they adopted this line of attack [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6279.2s)]
*  that JD Vance and Donald Trump are weird. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6281.4s)]
*  Remember this? [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6284.36s)]
*  Very well. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6285.56s)]
*  They were like, weird. [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6287.76s)]
*  Now I love laughing that off [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6289.2s)]
*  because of how absurd the use of that word [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6290.52s)]
*  coming from those people is. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6293.76s)]
*  The abortion worshipers are telling you JD Vance is weird. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6295.36s)]
*  Yeah, the men in dresses crew. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6297.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, it's so weird. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6300.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6302.08s)]
*  Here's our tranny admiral, not weird. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6302.92s)]
*  But you have to be honest enough to admit [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6305.08s)]
*  it's an effective line of attack [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6308.68s)]
*  insofar as it's the kind of thing that, [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6310.72s)]
*  it's like the language of the teenage girl. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6313.400000000001s)]
*  It's like, it doesn't require a deep assessment [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6315.88s)]
*  of what's going on. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6319.24s)]
*  You use weird. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6320.08s)]
*  It's a way to make somebody toxic. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6321.24s)]
*  And it's effective. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6324.32s)]
*  It's an effective weapon. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6325.84s)]
*  So there's gonna be a category of voter [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6327.92s)]
*  that definitely cares a lot about the policies [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6330.04s)]
*  and specifically the ways in which they affect them [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6332.92s)]
*  and their bottom line. [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6335.08s)]
*  But there are also broad categories of voters [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6336.24s)]
*  who really do kind of ride the vibes of an election. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6337.96s)]
*  Who is this person? [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6340.28s)]
*  And I don't mean vote switchers. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6341.12s)]
*  I mean, whether or not they'll show up to the polls at all. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6342.84s)]
*  And so, okay, weird's one line of attack. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6345.84s)]
*  What's the line of attack on Kamala? [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6348.32s)]
*  She's a phony. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6350.76s)]
*  She's fraudulent. [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6352.16s)]
*  She's a fake. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6353.48s)]
*  Now, if Trump gets up on a stage and he goes, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6354.68s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a phony. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6357.16s)]
*  Does CNN cover that? [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6358.96s)]
*  Does the New York Times put her on A1? [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6360.64s)]
*  Does Washington Post, any of these news outlets? [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6362.92s)]
*  No. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6365.56s)]
*  But if Trump goes on stage and he goes, she's black? [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6366.4s)]
*  It's like five minutes ago, she was Indian. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6369.68s)]
*  Now she's black? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6371.2s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6372.16s)]
*  I love them both, [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6373.0s)]
*  but somebody's gotta answer that question. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6373.96s)]
*  Everyone went crazy. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6375.96s)]
*  I know. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6377.8s)]
*  And it was perfect. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6378.64s)]
*  And the reason it was perfect [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6380.04s)]
*  was because it forced all of the places that hate Trump [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6381.96s)]
*  to carry his remarks. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6384.92s)]
*  And it fed an underlying, [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6386.64s)]
*  the subtext of that entire exchange is, [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6388.2s)]
*  Kamala Harris is a phony. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6390.6s)]
*  And it implants it right into the lifeblood [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6392.32s)]
*  of the United States. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6394.28s)]
*  Like people get to see it no matter where you consider it. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6395.32s)]
*  I wish they'd done that with Obama. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6396.56s)]
*  He, I mean, he's half white, raised by white people. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6398.28s)]
*  He's more white than he is black. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6401.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6403.12s)]
*  Culturally, and he is exactly one half white. [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6404.68s)]
*  Sure. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6408.12s)]
*  So why did Republicans not say are half white president [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6408.96s)]
*  or half black president? [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6411.8s)]
*  Like, why do they have to be like the first black president [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6412.88s)]
*  just buy into the lie? [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6414.76s)]
*  It's a lie. [[01:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6415.92s)]
*  And they had, it gave him moral power [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6417.76s)]
*  because it, you know, made him, [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6421.12s)]
*  it gave him claim to the civil rights movement, [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6423.88s)]
*  which is like the one sort of holy story [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6426.36s)]
*  in American history. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6429.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6430.5599999999995s)]
*  Supposedly. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6431.4s)]
*  Self-alive, but whatever, everyone's been taught that. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6432.839999999999s)]
*  And he got to lay claim to that. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6434.679999999999s)]
*  But no one else had the balls to puncture it. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6436.919999999999s)]
*  And just saying. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6438.799999999999s)]
*  But also like Kamala, his family didn't come from, [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6439.639999999999s)]
*  wasn't in the United States. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6441.2s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware, the whole thing was fraudulent. [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6442.04s)]
*  But just as he factual matters, a genetic matter, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6443.36s)]
*  I'm not attacking anybody, obviously. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6446.679999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying like he's half white. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6448.959999999999s)]
*  But no one, that was considered so outrageous. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6451.799999999999s)]
*  That'd be like white lives matter or all lives matter. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6456.24s)]
*  Another demonstrably factually true phrase [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6459.28s)]
*  that became a criminal offense, literally a criminal offense. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6462.84s)]
*  Like the FBI investigating people [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6465.4s)]
*  for saying white lives matter. [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6466.48s)]
*  And nobody pushed back. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6468.639999999999s)]
*  And these categories don't exist [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6469.84s)]
*  for any practical sort of descriptive reason. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6471.28s)]
*  They only exist for political power because like, you know, [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6473.679999999999s)]
*  if you call Elon Musk an African-American, [[01:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6476.08s)]
*  like people are like, that's like a total violation. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6478.4s)]
*  You're not allowed to say that despite the fact that he is. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6481.32s)]
*  Or if like, you know, George Carlin once cited this, [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6483.8s)]
*  like if you come from Egypt, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6485.719999999999s)]
*  you're technically, you're an African-American. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6487.5599999999995s)]
*  Are we allowed to say that? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6489.639999999999s)]
*  If you're an Egyptian or you called somebody an African? [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6490.48s)]
*  No, not in American political discourse. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6492.28s)]
*  But what does it mean allowed? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6493.92s)]
*  Why not just tell the truth? [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6495.0s)]
*  Like, why are we such cowards? [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6496.08s)]
*  If you allow lies to go unchallenged, they harden. [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6498.0s)]
*  And then they become, you know, [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6502.24s)]
*  they become the instruments of torture [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6504.92s)]
*  that you'll suffer under. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6506.639999999999s)]
*  That's a fact. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6507.799999999999s)]
*  So like, why are we playing along with this? [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6509.08s)]
*  What cowards are we? [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6512.0s)]
*  I never called Obama. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6514.04s)]
*  I was on TV every day of the Obama administration. [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6515.16s)]
*  I never said our half white press, he's half black, [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6517.12s)]
*  which is a fact. [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6519.96s)]
*  Like I didn't have the balls to say that. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6520.8s)]
*  What's wrong with me? [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6522.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6523.28s)]
*  And like, you like how like people get mad [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6524.12s)]
*  if Trump refers to him as Barack Hussein Obama. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6526.16s)]
*  They'll say Barack Hussein Obama, [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6528.88s)]
*  which is actually his middle name. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6530.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6531.5599999999995s)]
*  And you're like, you can't, [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6532.4s)]
*  how racist is he for saying that? [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6533.24s)]
*  Why am I playing by your rules anyway? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6535.48s)]
*  Because somebody was named Saddam Hussein, [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6537.44s)]
*  now I can't say Barack Hussein Obama. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6539.12s)]
*  Like, what is? [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6541.0s)]
*  It actually matters though. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6541.84s)]
*  If you decide that you're gonna lie [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6542.92s)]
*  because someone is quote making you, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6548.08s)]
*  like whose fault is that? [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6551.16s)]
*  It's yours. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6552.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6553.68s)]
*  And there's a lot of that going on unfortunately. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6554.5s)]
*  So I keep interrupting you. [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6556.12s)]
*  What is going to be the theme of this convention? [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6559.08s)]
*  It starts today. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6563.16s)]
*  I mean, it's gonna be, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6565.88s)]
*  I mean, you'll see the chaos on the outside, [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6568.9400000000005s)]
*  but on the inside, you're gonna be served [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6570.68s)]
*  an endless stream of lies [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6573.4800000000005s)]
*  about the current state of our country. [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6575.280000000001s)]
*  They'll tell you that the misery that exists within it [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6577.6s)]
*  is not actually happening. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6580.26s)]
*  That people are far happier, [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6581.320000000001s)]
*  that things are fine. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6584.76s)]
*  Also, you're gonna get this weird. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6585.72s)]
*  So she's gonna run as the incumbent basically. [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6587.400000000001s)]
*  They want everything. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6590.740000000001s)]
*  They want it both ways. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6591.58s)]
*  I know. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6592.42s)]
*  Because they're gonna lie to you [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6593.26s)]
*  about the current state of affairs [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6594.320000000001s)]
*  and then they're gonna tell you what her day one agenda is [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6595.68s)]
*  as if she didn't have power to begin with. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6598.14s)]
*  Right. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6600.780000000001s)]
*  So they're doing, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6601.62s)]
*  and the Trump campaign has been great on this. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6602.46s)]
*  They said her day one was three and a half years ago. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6603.68s)]
*  So let's stop pretending that it's starting. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6605.46s)]
*  So that's why, I mean, they could make her president. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6607.62s)]
*  I mean, they could 25th Amendment Biden. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6610.08s)]
*  I mean, they basically already have in effect, [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6611.9400000000005s)]
*  if not literally, but they could just make her president. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6614.06s)]
*  Probably by all rights should [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6617.14s)]
*  because she does seem non-senile, [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6619.22s)]
*  but they won't because they don't want her [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6623.06s)]
*  to have to take responsibility [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6625.62s)]
*  for the current state of the country. [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6626.62s)]
*  Is that, that's my guess. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6629.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6630.58s)]
*  Yeah, or they're so wrapped up in the idea that, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6631.62s)]
*  oh, we shouldn't give it to her this way [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6634.0199999999995s)]
*  because we give it to her with the election [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6635.34s)]
*  is more legitimate or something. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6636.82s)]
*  Like they shouldn't, [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6638.18s)]
*  the woman shouldn't have to be made president [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6639.42s)]
*  by virtue of the 25th Amendment. [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6641.26s)]
*  The first woman president, but just, you know, [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6642.46s)]
*  we settled on her. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6644.82s)]
*  I don't know what their thinking is on that. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6646.0599999999995s)]
*  Oh, they're doing the first woman thing? [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6647.58s)]
*  They're doing the first everything. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6649.54s)]
*  Really? [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6651.62s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6652.46s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6653.28s)]
*  They're gonna, that's gonna be a big theme this week. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6654.12s)]
*  The first woman? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6656.02s)]
*  The first woman president? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6657.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6658.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6659.5s)]
*  It's just crazy that like, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6660.34s)]
*  since we've already established [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6661.9400000000005s)]
*  that there's no definition of woman, [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6663.1s)]
*  like why should I care? [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6664.540000000001s)]
*  Tell me why I should care. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6665.5s)]
*  100%. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6666.620000000001s)]
*  You don't, I mean, there's no such thing as a woman. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6668.1s)]
*  So like, why is it meaningful that we have one as president? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6670.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6673.1s)]
*  And there's no difference between a woman and a man, none. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6673.9400000000005s)]
*  They can be Navy SEALs. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6676.620000000001s)]
*  So like, what's the significance of this? [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6678.820000000001s)]
*  There is none anymore. [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6682.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, they've erased, [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6683.860000000001s)]
*  the attacks on women that have been led by Biden and Harris [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6685.139999999999s)]
*  are, I think are unprecedented actually [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6688.98s)]
*  in American history. Of course. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6691.7s)]
*  I mean, if this is another area where it's like, [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6692.54s)]
*  Republicans really should sink their teeth into this [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6694.46s)]
*  in every possible way. [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6696.82s)]
*  So stupid. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6697.86s)]
*  But Title IX? [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6698.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6700.42s)]
*  The fact that the Biden administration came along [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6701.26s)]
*  and said that women are not a real category [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6703.139999999999s)]
*  and that men can be in their locker rooms [[01:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6705.58s)]
*  and take their sports teams and all of those things, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6707.5s)]
*  why isn't there like a nonstop campaign [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6711.58s)]
*  against that atrocity? [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6716.0199999999995s)]
*  There should be. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6717.66s)]
*  Like, why do we have women's sports then? [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6719.0599999999995s)]
*  What's the point of that? [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6721.14s)]
*  Why do we have any separate category for women [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6722.42s)]
*  to participate and succeed on an equal playing field? [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6724.26s)]
*  We shouldn't under that notion. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6727.62s)]
*  And so the Biden administration is leaning on all out assault [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6730.14s)]
*  on the very existence of women. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6733.3s)]
*  And then of course, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6735.58s)]
*  once the credit for the first woman president, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6737.3s)]
*  should that occur? [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6739.7s)]
*  So it's incoherent, obviously. [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6741.179999999999s)]
*  It's totally incoherent. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6742.34s)]
*  It's got all the markers of Marxism [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6743.179999999999s)]
*  as it presents itself throughout history. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6745.0599999999995s)]
*  Which is just deceptive to its core. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6747.34s)]
*  It does, it's shape shifting. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6749.54s)]
*  There are no fixed meanings to anything. [[01:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6751.139999999999s)]
*  It's just, I need to be empowered, you need to obey. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6752.74s)]
*  And those are the only immutable rules. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6754.78s)]
*  Yep, yep. [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6757.0599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it is very much like my body, my choice here, [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6758.0199999999995s)]
*  take the COVID Vax or I'll kill you. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6760.54s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6762.38s)]
*  It was? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6763.22s)]
*  I thought it was my body, my choice. [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6764.0599999999995s)]
*  No, only when you're killing your kids, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6765.58s)]
*  not when you're enforcing some. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6767.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's every single, I mean, it's like- [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6770.5s)]
*  I almost called it poison, [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6772.7s)]
*  but I would be censored by YouTube if I did that. [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6773.98s)]
*  So I just wanna be clear, [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6776.219999999999s)]
*  I'm not calling any substance [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6777.179999999999s)]
*  that was federally mandated poison. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6779.299999999999s)]
*  Okay, good, thank you for that. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6780.86s)]
*  And so, I mean, it's like guns too. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6782.46s)]
*  They're the same way on guns that, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6785.259999999999s)]
*  you don't need them, but we do, they'll protect us. [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6786.86s)]
*  It's all- [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6791.58s)]
*  Is she gonna get elected? [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6793.259999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris? [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6794.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6795.58s)]
*  I think it's a lot closer than I want it to be. [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6797.38s)]
*  There are 30 states that are, can we fill with drop boxes? [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6800.1s)]
*  That seems like a problem. [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6804.7s)]
*  And there've been some positive advances, [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6805.9s)]
*  like banning Zuckerbucks in 27 states. [[01:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6809.38s)]
*  It's all like states like Georgia and Texas [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6812.66s)]
*  have passed real voter integrity laws [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6814.34s)]
*  that have increased the quality of their election system. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6816.02s)]
*  But in other states like Pennsylvania, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6818.9s)]
*  where things are still too chaotic, [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6820.26s)]
*  where you have these drop boxes across the country, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6822.3s)]
*  Wisconsin, of course, these are pivotal states. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6824.62s)]
*  But like no state that has drop boxes [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6828.46s)]
*  can be considered legitimate. [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6831.7s)]
*  How can I believe an election result [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6835.9s)]
*  in a state with drop boxes? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6837.46s)]
*  Right, yeah, no matter what party you're a part of, [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6838.46s)]
*  if the election doesn't go your way [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6840.82s)]
*  and your state's full of drop boxes, [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6841.94s)]
*  your suspicions are gonna be sky high. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6844.1s)]
*  So how is that stabilizing for a Republican? [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6846.18s)]
*  So I had a conversation this morning, actually, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6847.82s)]
*  with someone, a well-known, very knowledgeable person [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6850.78s)]
*  from Republican politics who said, [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6855.9s)]
*  you know, there are all these states with drop boxes [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6858.14s)]
*  and I'm really concerned about this. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6859.5s)]
*  And I said, well, what, don't, [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6860.74s)]
*  is there an RNC that like exists to deal with this? [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6862.26s)]
*  And this person said, well, the problem is [[01:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6865.98s)]
*  that these drop boxes are disproportionately [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6868.66s)]
*  in what he called urban areas. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6871.5s)]
*  And no one at the RNC wants to be seen [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6874.62s)]
*  as criticizing the way things are done in urban areas. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6876.46s)]
*  And I thought, well, why is the RNC [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6879.7s)]
*  hiring guilty white liberals? [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6882.9s)]
*  If you're a guilty white liberal, I'm not attacking you. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6885.42s)]
*  You know, I don't wanna live near you or meet you, obviously. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6888.22s)]
*  But there's a political party for you. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6892.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6894.46s)]
*  Like, what are they doing at the RNC? [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6895.3s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6896.9s)]
*  It is a good question. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6898.42s)]
*  I mean, it is completely critical [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6900.0199999999995s)]
*  that we get ahold of that. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6903.66s)]
*  I mean, like, you know, you've got, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6904.62s)]
*  was it Michael Wotley and Lara Trump are now running [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6905.82s)]
*  the RNC, they established this renewed emphasis [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6908.42s)]
*  on voter integrity and all these, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6911.5s)]
*  I think they've got all sorts of legal challenges [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6915.1s)]
*  they've mounted across the country. [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6916.62s)]
*  That's headed in the right direction. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6917.58s)]
*  But if you are opting out of dealing [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6918.9800000000005s)]
*  with election integrity in critical areas [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6920.900000000001s)]
*  because you're afraid you'll be seen as racist [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6922.9800000000005s)]
*  for trying to protect the votes of the people who live there, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6924.7s)]
*  you've lost the plot. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6927.18s)]
*  You've lost the plot. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6928.42s)]
*  Because it turns out voter integrity laws, [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6929.74s)]
*  if we're talking about black voters specifically, [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6931.54s)]
*  are disproportionately beneficial to black voters. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6933.54s)]
*  Look what happened in Georgia [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6937.34s)]
*  after they changed their election laws [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6938.9400000000005s)]
*  to make it so that you can no longer [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6941.02s)]
*  just do signature matching on a mail-in ballot. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6942.9400000000005s)]
*  They said, you've got to send in your driver's license number [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6946.58s)]
*  with the ballot. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6949.1s)]
*  If you remember that. Well, yeah. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6949.9400000000005s)]
*  When they did that, black voter participation went up [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6951.3s)]
*  and fewer black votes were rejected. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6954.1s)]
*  Yeah. It's obvious. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6956.18s)]
*  And it's always obvious. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6957.62s)]
*  In fact, signature matching was working [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6959.26s)]
*  to the detriment of authentic black voters. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6961.1s)]
*  They were having their ballots thrown out [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6962.82s)]
*  because it turns out sometimes your signature [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6964.3s)]
*  doesn't match what you signed when you were 18 years old. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6965.74s)]
*  Like when you get older and you get some idiot [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6968.0199999999995s)]
*  who's looking at, not a handwriting special, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6970.38s)]
*  it's just some random bureaucrat looking at two ballots [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6972.82s)]
*  and the signature being like, throwing that out. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6975.42s)]
*  Throwing it, what? [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6978.139999999999s)]
*  I think that the period where there's gonna be [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6979.0599999999995s)]
*  this intense emphasis on black voters is coming to an end [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6981.54s)]
*  because of immigration. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6985.38s)]
*  And native-born black voters will become [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6987.139999999999s)]
*  less important to election outcomes, [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6992.74s)]
*  dramatically less important starting after this election. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6994.82s)]
*  And so that means black political power [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=6998.58s)]
*  as we've thought about it for the last 60 years [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7000.54s)]
*  will be in rapid, rapid decline. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7003.7s)]
*  And it's just interesting. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7005.82s)]
*  It sort of reminds me of organized labor. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7006.82s)]
*  You know, I'm not against unions. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7009.78s)]
*  I'm not against black voters. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7010.86s)]
*  I'm for all American voters. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7012.5s)]
*  But they got sold out by their leadership. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7014.179999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[01:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7016.38s)]
*  Yeah. Like so completely. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7017.219999999999s)]
*  And I'm not sure people really understand that. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7018.5s)]
*  Like, I just don't think it's gonna matter too much [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7021.259999999999s)]
*  actually because the demographics of the country [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7024.14s)]
*  have changed so much in the last 10 years that like, [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7026.660000000001s)]
*  do people get this? [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7032.46s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7034.02s)]
*  There's like some shifting it looks like among black men, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7035.18s)]
*  which has been good. [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7037.9400000000005s)]
*  The left is very angry about that. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7039.34s)]
*  And the more angry they get about it, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7040.820000000001s)]
*  the more likely they are to try and take it out on you. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7041.900000000001s)]
*  But increasingly, it's just symbolic though. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7043.860000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you have 10 million illegal aliens [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7046.22s)]
*  or 30 million illegal aliens, [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7049.38s)]
*  and we don't even know the number, [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7050.9800000000005s)]
*  but it's tens of millions [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7051.860000000001s)]
*  and they're all gonna vote sooner rather than later, [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7053.58s)]
*  probably, but definitely at some point, [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7056.42s)]
*  no one's gonna be deported. [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7057.78s)]
*  Then like the whole civil rights movement, [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7059.58s)]
*  that whole mythology becomes sort of meaningless [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7061.94s)]
*  because the democratic party will have political power [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7064.0199999999995s)]
*  without black voters. [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7065.98s)]
*  Like no matter what they do, it doesn't matter. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7066.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7068.14s)]
*  And then the whole history of that party [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7068.98s)]
*  has been hurting black people, black Americans. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7070.38s)]
*  It's disgraceful all the way from, [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7073.26s)]
*  you mentioned at the outset of the conversation, [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7075.74s)]
*  like the KKK and Margaret Sanger [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7077.18s)]
*  and the targeting and the so-called Negro project. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7079.0599999999995s)]
*  It has been a relentless assault actually [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7081.58s)]
*  on black Americans, which is a disgrace. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7084.46s)]
*  And I just hope more and more people can wake up to it. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7087.46s)]
*  But while they still have political power [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7090.34s)]
*  to the extent that they do, [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7092.1s)]
*  and it's being sold out now as you speak. [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7092.9800000000005s)]
*  And so that's crazy. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7095.58s)]
*  That's crazy. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7097.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have a ton of friends [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7098.66s)]
*  who are black Democrats. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7100.46s)]
*  I know a lot of and love a lot of right-wing black people, [[01:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7104.42s)]
*  but I have one friend who's a black Democrat [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7108.46s)]
*  really good guy. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7110.94s)]
*  But I made this point to him a few years ago. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7111.78s)]
*  I was like, it's kind of over for the political power [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7113.58s)]
*  that you've been talking about your whole life [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7117.46s)]
*  because of immigration. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7119.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7120.74s)]
*  And he had honestly not really thought about it. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7121.58s)]
*  Well, now you're seeing it in Chicago. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7126.5s)]
*  Now I'm bragging, but I think he agrees with me now [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7127.62s)]
*  because it's just, it's a numbers. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7129.22s)]
*  How many angry town hall meetings [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7130.94s)]
*  have you seen in Chicago over this issue? [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7132.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7134.5s)]
*  A lot, a lot. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7135.34s)]
*  Black residents of Chicago, they're going confronting [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7136.18s)]
*  by the aldermen, right in Chicago. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7138.9s)]
*  Confronting them and saying, what the hell? [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7141.5s)]
*  Why? [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7142.94s)]
*  So wait a second. [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7143.78s)]
*  So foreigners, illegal foreigners are pouring [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7144.62s)]
*  into the country. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7146.34s)]
*  They're coming to Chicago. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7147.18s)]
*  They're taking all of the public resources [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7148.5s)]
*  and we're being left in the slums. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7150.74s)]
*  And how many times has it happened before you wake up to it? [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7152.82s)]
*  Like when the riots were happening, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7155.26s)]
*  the George Floyd riots were occurring [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7157.62s)]
*  and Chicago became one of the latest cities to be ransacked. [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7159.22s)]
*  The lady who looked like Beetlejuice who ran the city, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7163.1s)]
*  she deployed the national guard to the extent [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7165.78s)]
*  that a mayor is supposed to do that anyway, [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7167.94s)]
*  but she was given resources. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7169.26s)]
*  She sent it to, what do they call that? [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7170.9400000000005s)]
*  The million mile or something, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7172.66s)]
*  the really nice area of Chicago, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7175.22s)]
*  where all of her donors live, [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7177.860000000001s)]
*  like the richest area of Chicago. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7178.860000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, the South side left defenseless. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7181.02s)]
*  People getting murdered in the streets, losing their lives, [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7183.26s)]
*  places being wrecked because she refused [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7186.5s)]
*  to protect the most vulnerable because she had no interest. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7189.02s)]
*  I saw this during Katrina in New Orleans. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7192.34s)]
*  The French quarter was fine. [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7194.26s)]
*  All the cops were in the French quarter. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7195.34s)]
*  Lower ninth, nobody. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7196.58s)]
*  I saw it. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7198.34s)]
*  Yeah, no, of course. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7199.900000000001s)]
*  It does sort of raise the question. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7201.54s)]
*  I mean, this is the purpose [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7203.46s)]
*  of ginning up racial hostility, obviously, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7204.66s)]
*  is to make people vote against their own interests, [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7207.74s)]
*  their demonstrable interests because they so despise [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7210.3s)]
*  or they're so afraid of the other party coming to power [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7214.9800000000005s)]
*  on racial grounds. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7218.1s)]
*  That's what is actually happening. [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7219.34s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7221.900000000001s)]
*  It's totally crazy. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7222.82s)]
*  So Kamala's campaign is about what? [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7224.62s)]
*  This week it's joy. [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7229.86s)]
*  It's joy. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7231.5s)]
*  This weekend, that's what they keep telling everybody. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7232.34s)]
*  I could think of it being about a lot of different things, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7235.58s)]
*  but joy is the most preposterous of all [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7238.5s)]
*  because she's so obviously joyous. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7240.9s)]
*  She's kissing her husband with a mask on. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7242.5s)]
*  So this is the most joyless person I've seen lately. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7244.94s)]
*  Well, that's consistent. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7249.74s)]
*  The pitch is opposite of everything she stands for. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7250.98s)]
*  But why? [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7252.82s)]
*  I've never really figured it out. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7254.22s)]
*  An effective lie is always a few degrees off from center, [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7257.82s)]
*  from the truth, right? [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7261.22s)]
*  Isn't it? [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7262.58s)]
*  I mean, last week she was like, [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7263.42s)]
*  I'm for no tax on tips now. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7264.74s)]
*  The Trump policy? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7267.7s)]
*  Yeah, I saw that. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7268.54s)]
*  Yeah, I'm for no tax on tips. [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7269.38s)]
*  She said, okay. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7270.78s)]
*  I'm like, what? [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7271.9s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7272.74s)]
*  Oh, I'm gonna secure the border. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7273.5599999999995s)]
*  What? [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7274.66s)]
*  Who are you? [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7275.5s)]
*  Will you stop lying to us? [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7276.34s)]
*  But why not instead? [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7277.78s)]
*  That's not how normal people lie. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7280.74s)]
*  Normal people catch you doing something wrong [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7282.38s)]
*  and you're like, it's not as bad as it looks. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7285.5s)]
*  But you don't whip around and accuse me [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7288.54s)]
*  of doing the exact thing that I caught you doing. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7290.9400000000005s)]
*  What is that? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7293.58s)]
*  No, that you do in an abusive relationship. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7294.42s)]
*  Really? [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7298.38s)]
*  Yeah, in an abusive human relationship. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7299.22s)]
*  I mean, this is kind of like the classic [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7301.1s)]
*  sort of like cheating on your wife [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7302.42s)]
*  and trying to figure out a way to survive it. [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7304.86s)]
*  You start blaming her as the sinner, right? [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7307.14s)]
*  So the Democratic Party's relationship with Americans [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7309.94s)]
*  is an abusive one. [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7314.219999999999s)]
*  I saw that. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7315.82s)]
*  I actually saw that once. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7316.66s)]
*  I was actually, probably you didn't tell us. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7317.74s)]
*  I was with somebody who I wasn't there for this, [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7319.7s)]
*  but he got caught cheating. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7322.66s)]
*  And I was like, whoa, not a good person. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7324.299999999999s)]
*  And I said, what did you say? [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7328.0599999999995s)]
*  And he said, I screamed at her for spending too much [[02:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7329.62s)]
*  at Saks on our credit card. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7331.82s)]
*  I was like, what? [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7334.5s)]
*  You get caught, or she had evidence [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7336.28s)]
*  that he was doing something wrong, which he was. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7338.26s)]
*  And you attack her? [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7340.74s)]
*  I thought that was the most screwed up thing [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7342.22s)]
*  I'd ever seen. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7344.06s)]
*  But that's a thing you're saying. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7345.02s)]
*  Definitely. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7347.14s)]
*  Which is why family analogies are so perfect for all of this. [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7348.22s)]
*  It's like, what do you do? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7350.62s)]
*  I know you've done this for years, [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7352.34s)]
*  but like, what does it mean to run a healthy household? [[02:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7353.46s)]
*  Like, do you lock your doors at night? [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7356.38s)]
*  How do you protect your family? [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7359.06s)]
*  What does that look like? [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7360.860000000001s)]
*  What kind of example are you to your children? [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7361.7s)]
*  All of those things. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7363.7s)]
*  The only things that matter, you mean? [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7364.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7365.820000000001s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7366.66s)]
*  Democrats are leading the most dysfunctional household [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7367.48s)]
*  you've ever seen. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7371.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7372.0s)]
*  They're like abusing the children, attacking each other, [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7372.82s)]
*  all the sins that they're committing, [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7375.12s)]
*  they're projecting onto all their other family members. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7376.24s)]
*  Yes. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7378.24s)]
*  It's really degrading and total dysfunction. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7379.08s)]
*  It's awful. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7382.759999999999s)]
*  And it's also why it's godless. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7384.12s)]
*  It's also why it's godless, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7385.839999999999s)]
*  because you begin assuming this omnipotent power [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7387.32s)]
*  over reality itself, and begin telling everyone else [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7390.12s)]
*  that they're the problem, and they're the sinners, [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7393.0s)]
*  and that they should respond to you. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7394.86s)]
*  And it's, meanwhile, in the healthy household, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7396.24s)]
*  what's happening is there's a father who's demoing [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7399.44s)]
*  for his children what it looks like to have a father's love. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7403.28s)]
*  And their children only know God through that lens. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7406.96s)]
*  Yes. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7409.719999999999s)]
*  They only can, that's how you know. [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7410.5599999999995s)]
*  How do you, so we refer to God the father. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7411.88s)]
*  How do you even know how he functions as a father [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7413.84s)]
*  unless you have a human father as a frame of reference? [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7416.28s)]
*  You don't. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7419.5599999999995s)]
*  You don't understand what that looks like. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7420.639999999999s)]
*  If you have a dysfunctional relationship [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7421.92s)]
*  with the men in your life, [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7423.48s)]
*  how are you even ever gonna get your head around the idea [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7424.86s)]
*  that God the father is a loving father? [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7427.259999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7429.5s)]
*  So like all of these things, it's just- [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7430.34s)]
*  I do know, I've never thought of it before, [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7432.82s)]
*  but this is a, yes, I know exactly, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7434.299999999999s)]
*  of course I know exactly what you mean. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7436.5s)]
*  It's why the fathers are so important, [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7437.46s)]
*  because like all of reality centers around [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7439.54s)]
*  what your impression of what it means [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7441.82s)]
*  to have a good father is. [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7443.16s)]
*  That's it, that's the whole ball game. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7444.94s)]
*  So the left is leading the dysfunctional household [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7447.38s)]
*  where they're driving everybody to self-destruction, [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7450.78s)]
*  and it should be the obligation of normal people [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7454.32s)]
*  to counter that and to have a healthy household, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7457.2s)]
*  and by extension, a healthy country. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7459.719999999999s)]
*  That's so interesting. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7462.799999999999s)]
*  I have noticed the symptoms of what you're saying, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7464.599999999999s)]
*  and the main one is the people they're attacking. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7468.12s)]
*  I don't have a PhD on America or whatever, [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7471.32s)]
*  but I know a lot of like rural Trump voters, for example, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7473.799999999999s)]
*  and they're not only good people, [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7478.759999999999s)]
*  they're actually like the best people I've ever met, [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7479.88s)]
*  and they're also the most useful [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7481.64s)]
*  and skillful people I've ever met, like the most, [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7484.08s)]
*  like actually the most, they can do the most useful things. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7485.8s)]
*  And the people attacking them, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7489.68s)]
*  someone like Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7491.200000000001s)]
*  from my perspective, which is a simple perspective, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7494.68s)]
*  because I'm a simple man, [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7497.280000000001s)]
*  is like an utterly disgraced figure, like utterly. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7498.6s)]
*  Like there's no one who has less credibility, [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7502.4400000000005s)]
*  a shorter track record of real achievement. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7505.04s)]
*  There's no one who's like more repulsive [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7508.4800000000005s)]
*  in every way than Janet Yellen, to me anyway. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7510.44s)]
*  And she's the one helping to like malign people [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7514.36s)]
*  with real skills. [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7519.04s)]
*  It's like, that's not an accident. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7520.08s)]
*  This whole system is set up for useless people to have power, [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7521.719999999999s)]
*  whereas in a just society, they would have no power. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7525.16s)]
*  I know. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7527.639999999999s)]
*  Sometimes I wonder like at the lowest levels, [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7528.839999999999s)]
*  like whether like the productive among us are like, [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7531.04s)]
*  I don't know, it's, you know how like [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7536.16s)]
*  at the lowest levels of government, [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7537.44s)]
*  other than the household, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7539.08s)]
*  which of course we were just talking about, [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7540.0s)]
*  like the HOAs and the community boards, [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7541.64s)]
*  like they're all consistent of like [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7545.4s)]
*  the insecure busy bodies. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7547.6s)]
*  Right, no, totally. [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7548.96s)]
*  And like the productive people who should be in those roles, [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7550.48s)]
*  the ones who have families and know how to mediate [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7554.12s)]
*  a dispute between their children. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7556.68s)]
*  Insecure busy bodies. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7558.08s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7559.48s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7560.32s)]
*  Like they're not actually in charge of those organizations. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7561.16s)]
*  No. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7562.4s)]
*  And so, I don't know, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7563.24s)]
*  this is the best system ever devised [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7565.32s)]
*  in terms of a government, [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7567.24s)]
*  but there are clearly weaknesses. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7568.48s)]
*  Like that's, and that's one of them. [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7570.0s)]
*  The feeder system into the bigger aspects of government [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7571.24s)]
*  is a lot of insecure busy bodies. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7574.4s)]
*  That's, and maybe that's probably always been that way. [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7577.44s)]
*  You know, I'm sure the Roman Senate [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7581.839999999999s)]
*  was full with insecure busy bodies. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7583.08s)]
*  But it never, I guess what I think is new [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7585.08s)]
*  and really obnoxious at best, poisonous at worst, [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7588.879999999999s)]
*  is not just that like the least competent people [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7593.5199999999995s)]
*  have the most power, [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7596.5599999999995s)]
*  but that they use that power [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7597.96s)]
*  to hurt the most competent people. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7599.0s)]
*  That is just crazy to me. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7601.0s)]
*  It is. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7602.6s)]
*  Like you would think like they would, [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7603.44s)]
*  at least for self-interest reasons, [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7604.28s)]
*  they would say, well, you know, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7606.44s)]
*  people actually know how to run a power grid [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7607.76s)]
*  or fly an airplane or perform heart surgery. [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7610.16s)]
*  Like we shouldn't attack them on the basis of their skin color [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7611.96s)]
*  because we like need those people. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7614.16s)]
*  We don't want to be Zimbabwe, [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7615.36s)]
*  but they seem to want to destroy all those people. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7617.4s)]
*  Do you feel like that's gotten worse? [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7619.84s)]
*  I mean, obviously it feels like- [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7621.88s)]
*  Oh my gosh, yes. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7622.72s)]
*  Like the, you know, you asked me earlier about like [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7624.56s)]
*  the distance that the ruling class has [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7626.88s)]
*  from the rest of America. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7629.2s)]
*  You'd probably be better at answering that question. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7631.52s)]
*  Like, I mean- I don't know. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7633.16s)]
*  I mean, I obviously, you know, [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7634.28s)]
*  I guess I'm part of the ruling class. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7636.4400000000005s)]
*  I've been in it my whole life. [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7637.52s)]
*  And I do think it gives me a better perspective [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7638.52s)]
*  on how lame they are. [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7641.8s)]
*  There's no mystery for me. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7643.6s)]
*  I know exactly who they are because I know them. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7644.76s)]
*  But, and I have total contempt for them. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7647.0s)]
*  Whoa, I'm trying to control it. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7649.36s)]
*  No, my conclusion, just based on the evidence, [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7652.64s)]
*  again, it's hard to know intent, impossible really, [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7655.32s)]
*  but just on the basis of outcomes, [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7657.2s)]
*  is that the whole point of the program [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7659.32s)]
*  is not to uplift anyone. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7660.96s)]
*  It's to hurt people, specifically Christians above all, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7662.44s)]
*  but also anyone who's productive, free thinking, [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7667.799999999999s)]
*  you know, the people you really need, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7671.5599999999995s)]
*  like the guys who designed and run the power grid. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7672.799999999999s)]
*  Like those are the people you need most. [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7675.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7676.88s)]
*  First responders, firemen, cops, EMTs, airline pilots. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7677.719999999999s)]
*  It's not just like, oh, we need more [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7683.0s)]
*  incompetent airline pilots. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7685.6s)]
*  It's that we need the current group of airline pilots to die [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7687.8s)]
*  because they have skills that we'll never have. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7692.48s)]
*  I mean, I feel like this whole system is based on hatred, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7696.0s)]
*  born of envy. [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7700.8s)]
*  That's the way I read it. [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7702.56s)]
*  And you look at there, a couple of foreign countries, [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7704.08s)]
*  South Africa and Zimbabwe particularly, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7705.72s)]
*  where the whole point wasn't to like redistribute the land [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7709.12s)]
*  to the landless, that didn't actually happen. [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7712.4400000000005s)]
*  All the land went to the people with political power. [[02:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7714.12s)]
*  The point was to crush the farmers [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7716.84s)]
*  because the farmers were too productive [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7719.84s)]
*  and that was offensive to the people in charge. [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7722.04s)]
*  It's like, you go get that yield out of that land [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7723.92s)]
*  when you're tobacco or whatever you're growing. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7726.64s)]
*  They couldn't, so we have to crush, kill them. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7728.72s)]
*  They killed them, a lot of them. [[02:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7730.64s)]
*  And so I feel like they're hurting people is the point. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7733.08s)]
*  That does feel, it's definitely not about helping [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7736.12s)]
*  black people or helping trans community [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7738.64s)]
*  or helping immigrants. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7740.56s)]
*  I probably wouldn't be totally against it if it was. [[02:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7742.6s)]
*  I like helping people, but it's not. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7744.8s)]
*  It's not about that. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7746.64s)]
*  But if your policy is like all of that [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7747.4800000000005s)]
*  is enabling their destruction. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7748.68s)]
*  The enabling is what's happening. [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7750.88s)]
*  So like, this whole like the needle exchange programs, [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7752.360000000001s)]
*  like the left has been on this for years. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7754.88s)]
*  You're gonna help people continue to inject drugs [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7756.64s)]
*  into their bodies, that's the plan. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7758.52s)]
*  Like all of the marijuana initiatives, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7761.320000000001s)]
*  like you're gonna continue, you're gonna dull people. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7763.96s)]
*  The plan is to broadly dull the American people. [[02:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7766.200000000001s)]
*  The trans stuff, you're gonna tell people, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7768.48s)]
*  yes, your body's a mistake. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7770.4s)]
*  The only intervention is my big corporate donor [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7771.719999999999s)]
*  getting rich off of your misery for the rest of your life. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7773.799999999999s)]
*  Like that's, again, to go back to the family analogy, [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7777.08s)]
*  in a family, you would intervene. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7781.0s)]
*  In a real, in a healthy family. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7783.719999999999s)]
*  In a dysfunctional family, you would enable. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7785.0s)]
*  And that's what they're doing. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7788.0s)]
*  They're enabling destruction. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7788.839999999999s)]
*  You see, I can't relate. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7791.04s)]
*  I mean, I am the oldest man in my family [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7792.28s)]
*  pretty much at this point. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7794.639999999999s)]
*  So I intervene all the time. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7795.599999999999s)]
*  That's what you do. [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7798.56s)]
*  I've seen it. [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7799.4s)]
*  Yeah, I'm an intervener, like immediate intervener. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7800.24s)]
*  So I think that's your duty. [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7803.68s)]
*  And I just kind of, I don't, I love this country [[02:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7806.12s)]
*  and I love its cities, for example. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7810.32s)]
*  I've lived in a number of them, [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7812.92s)]
*  but I have contempt for people who allow [[02:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7813.96s)]
*  like a needle exchange program to happen. [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7816.6s)]
*  Like, why doesn't someone go burn down the needle exchange? [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7819.32s)]
*  Like, I'm serious and take the lumps, go to jail for it. [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7822.2s)]
*  But we're not gonna give people intravenous drugs [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7824.5199999999995s)]
*  in my neighborhood, period. [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7827.28s)]
*  I'm not gonna put up with that, period. [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7828.8s)]
*  And if you punish me for getting in the way, [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7830.759999999999s)]
*  I will accept that punishment, but I'm not gonna allow it. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7832.4s)]
*  I don't know why people allow that. [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7835.639999999999s)]
*  I really don't. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7837.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm probably saying too much, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7838.36s)]
*  but I'm not encouraging violence. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7839.36s)]
*  I'm encouraging zero tolerance for killing people. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7841.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7844.88s)]
*  Yeah, but you know, meanwhile, the Biden administration, [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7845.719999999999s)]
*  like sending out needle kits, like they're like, [[02:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7847.8s)]
*  they're a part of this. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7849.96s)]
*  And, but, and it's just. [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7850.8s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7853.5599999999995s)]
*  If you accept that, what won't you accept? [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7854.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7857.92s)]
*  I mean, I was in Australia this year [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7858.759999999999s)]
*  and they put people in camps and concentration camps, [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7859.599999999999s)]
*  like actual, and if you bring that up, you know, [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7862.12s)]
*  that you put people in concentration camps for COVID. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7865.679999999999s)]
*  Well, they're not really concentration camps, really? [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7867.639999999999s)]
*  I remember. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7870.2s)]
*  Where were they? [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7871.04s)]
*  I remember the colored tape that they had on the floor. [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7871.879999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7873.48s)]
*  That you stepped across it, you would be arrested. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7874.32s)]
*  Yeah, and they did. [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7876.44s)]
*  They arrested people. [[02:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7877.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7878.12s)]
*  And people put up with it. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7878.96s)]
*  You're gonna get to a place like Canada [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7879.799999999999s)]
*  where they're just like, whoa, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7880.879999999999s)]
*  getting to the exact same place that Germany got to in 1933, [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7882.92s)]
*  where if you're useless, we're gonna kill you. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7886.8s)]
*  Which they did, they killed hundreds of thousands [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7888.88s)]
*  of Germans, Christian Germans, [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7890.2s)]
*  because they had disabilities or they were useless. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7892.36s)]
*  And they murdered them in hospitals, children. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7894.84s)]
*  And they're doing that in Canada now with the maid program [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7897.2s)]
*  and just killing people. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7899.76s)]
*  Well, it's just cheaper for us to kill you. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7902.04s)]
*  And everyone's putting up with it. [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7904.64s)]
*  It's just like, you can't put up with certain things. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7905.6s)]
*  And they'll punish the useful. [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7908.64s)]
*  So they'll kill the useless and punish the useful. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7910.4400000000005s)]
*  Of course. [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7912.16s)]
*  So the truckers in Canada get their lives destroyed [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7913.0s)]
*  by merely exercising what is their God given right, [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7916.8s)]
*  which is to protest, which is to object [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7919.599999999999s)]
*  in the democratic system in which they thought they lived [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7922.08s)]
*  and then had their lives destroyed. [[02:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7925.08s)]
*  And because they didn't have any power to stop it. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7926.28s)]
*  And that was, I mean, Antifa burns down cities, [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7928.48s)]
*  Canadian truckers set up hot tubs in the streets [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7931.28s)]
*  and protest the government. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7933.72s)]
*  Yeah, it just seems like there's no kind of way out [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7936.16s)]
*  other than saying, you know, I'm willing to be punished [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7940.48s)]
*  for trying to stop the killing of other people. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7945.04s)]
*  And that's what I don't like about the party system. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7950.599999999999s)]
*  It obscures what's at stake. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7952.4s)]
*  It's like, well, I want my guy to get elected [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7953.879999999999s)]
*  or my party to thrive. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7955.839999999999s)]
*  It's like, none of that really matters. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7956.759999999999s)]
*  You cannot allow some NGO to abet intravenous drug use. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7958.04s)]
*  Like, let's just start there. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7964.08s)]
*  Or no. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7965.0s)]
*  Or fund the NGOs to the tune of billions of dollars [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7965.839999999999s)]
*  to traffic every foreign national across our border [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7968.8s)]
*  they can get their hands on. [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7971.2s)]
*  Yeah, well, I never understood why the totally useless [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7972.320000000001s)]
*  governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7975.72s)]
*  didn't just put the national guard on the border. [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7977.96s)]
*  I've said that to his face. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7979.360000000001s)]
*  I ran into him at an event. [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7981.28s)]
*  I was like, why don't you do that? [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7982.360000000001s)]
*  Well, it's really complicated. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7983.68s)]
*  It's not complicated. [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7984.72s)]
*  If there's a home invasion at my house, [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7986.2s)]
*  I'm gonna get my firearm and stop it if I can. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7988.6s)]
*  And then I'll deal with the consequences. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7991.56s)]
*  It was my family. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7992.84s)]
*  So that's my priority is pretty simple, protect my family. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7993.68s)]
*  And then, if the laws are broken, I'll take my lumps. [[02:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=7997.28s)]
*  Do you think mass deportation is possible? [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8000.2s)]
*  Of course not. [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8002.679999999999s)]
*  Of course it's not possible. [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8003.639999999999s)]
*  So the majority of the public supports it right now. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8005.08s)]
*  They don't have the stomach for the images of it, obviously. [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8008.84s)]
*  So the second, the media can find one sob story. [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8012.32s)]
*  They'll accelerate it quickly to hurt Trump [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8016.16s)]
*  and to justify allowing the chaos to continue. [[02:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8019.24s)]
*  And I do think there's a middle ground. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8023.24s)]
*  I don't think you have to do mass deportations. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8025.48s)]
*  I think if Washington was responsible enough, [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8027.28s)]
*  which of course we know the answer, they're not. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8030.839999999999s)]
*  But if they were responsible enough, [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8033.08s)]
*  they could just create the conditions [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8034.4s)]
*  whereby people wouldn't be able to live here [[02:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8035.5199999999995s)]
*  and take from us. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8038.5199999999995s)]
*  So pass nationwide verify. [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8040.759999999999s)]
*  Like literally force businesses to have to hire workers [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8043.16s)]
*  who are allowed to work for them. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8046.0s)]
*  But we're so far past that, [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8047.08s)]
*  because that presupposes that the immigrants, [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8048.5599999999995s)]
*  all they're getting is access to our labor markets. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8053.0s)]
*  Either if I would stop people from working without papers, [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8057.4s)]
*  without the legal right to work. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8061.64s)]
*  But we're bringing in tens of millions of people [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8063.32s)]
*  and giving them flat out subsidies [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8067.24s)]
*  that are much higher than American citizens are receiving. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8070.24s)]
*  So we're paying them to come here. [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8073.72s)]
*  We paid for their travel up here indirectly, [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8076.16s)]
*  State Department's doing it, UN's doing it at scale. [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8078.12s)]
*  And then once they get here, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8081.28s)]
*  it's a pinata party with US tax dollars, [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8083.68s)]
*  a bankrupt country is paying people to invade it. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8086.8s)]
*  So at that point, it's like, what are we really looking at? [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8090.6s)]
*  Well, you're looking at suicide. [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8092.4400000000005s)]
*  Like you're looking at a country [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8093.92s)]
*  that's trying to destroy itself [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8094.76s)]
*  or whose leaders are trying to destroy it. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8096.76s)]
*  And then that's when you reach the point, [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8098.360000000001s)]
*  like I have to say more prayers about this, I don't know. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8100.4400000000005s)]
*  I know, but if you had a real administration [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8103.16s)]
*  that could come in who had the will to do it, [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8106.72s)]
*  you cut off all of that. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8108.88s)]
*  You don't need to be- [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8110.2s)]
*  You could explain it. [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8111.04s)]
*  Words matter. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8112.68s)]
*  Someone who could just get up and say, [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8113.5199999999995s)]
*  not against immigrants, but this is obviously suicide [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8114.84s)]
*  and we're not gonna participate in it. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8117.36s)]
*  Is JD Vance a good explainer? [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8118.32s)]
*  I think he's great and he's sincere. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8120.56s)]
*  Certainly politics is not good for people. [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8124.72s)]
*  So I have seen people change, I pray that he doesn't, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8127.4s)]
*  but as someone who knows him pretty well, I think, [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8130.44s)]
*  as of right now, I think he's the opposite of weird. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8135.2s)]
*  He is, and I think they're all weird. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8139.12s)]
*  I'm not even gonna say all the people I know [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8140.76s)]
*  are actually really weird in Republican politics. [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8142.24s)]
*  It's definitely most of them. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8144.92s)]
*  Some of them are obvious, Lindsey Graham or whatever, [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8146.16s)]
*  everyone jokes about it, but there are so many freaks, [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8148.08s)]
*  like just truly deceptive people [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8152.24s)]
*  because the business draws them like a bug light. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8154.64s)]
*  He's not at all that way. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8157.04s)]
*  So- [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8159.52s)]
*  You're not excluding Democrats from that assessment. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8160.64s)]
*  You're just saying, you happen to know [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8162.2s)]
*  that a lot of Republicans are weird. [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8163.68s)]
*  Anyone at this point in the training party is like, [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8164.88s)]
*  you're a freak. [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8168.68s)]
*  That's a female admiral. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8170.639999999999s)]
*  If you're saying that, what? [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8172.04s)]
*  No, I mean, in the Republican party, [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8174.44s)]
*  which should be the party of normal people, [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8175.76s)]
*  it represents normal people. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8177.28s)]
*  Tries to, pretends to. [[02:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8179.16s)]
*  So no, JD Vance is the most normal person. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8180.719999999999s)]
*  Oh, so you really think that. [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8184.16s)]
*  I have wondered, you know a lot of these guys. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8185.0s)]
*  Is JD Vance, he's at the top of the normal people list [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8189.36s)]
*  for now? [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8192.119999999999s)]
*  I think he is. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8192.94s)]
*  Are there a couple who are really normal? [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8195.08s)]
*  In my opinion, this is just my opinion, [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8197.36s)]
*  one man's opinion, but Senator Schmidt from Missouri [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8199.24s)]
*  is a wonderful man. [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8202.96s)]
*  Like an actual good person. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8204.279999999999s)]
*  I know that for a fact. [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8206.88s)]
*  So, I'm sure there are others. [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8208.8s)]
*  Yeah, I like Tommy Tuberville. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8212.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so I don't know him. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8214.0s)]
*  I just have talked to him a lot. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8215.599999999999s)]
*  I thought he was a hero for the abortion fight. [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8216.8s)]
*  Yeah, I completely agree. [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8218.359999999999s)]
*  No, look, I'm generalizing. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8220.199999999999s)]
*  I'm just disappointed in the party, [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8221.56s)]
*  but there are certainly a ton of freaks. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8222.82s)]
*  JD is not. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8224.039999999999s)]
*  He's like a normal person. [[02:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8225.279999999999s)]
*  And he's legit smart. [[02:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8227.919999999998s)]
*  So yeah, he could definitely make the case. [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8230.96s)]
*  And what purpose does he serve? [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8232.8s)]
*  Is it just to explain or what purpose does he serve [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8233.759999999998s)]
*  working with Trump, do you think? [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8235.72s)]
*  Well, again, these are just, I mean, my opinions, [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8238.4s)]
*  I don't really know the answer. [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8241.08s)]
*  How does turning to an interview with me, anyway? [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8242.119999999999s)]
*  I just want to know. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8243.56s)]
*  I genuinely want to know, [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8245.08s)]
*  because I know you're a fan of JD. [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8245.919999999998s)]
*  I am, yeah. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8247.599999999999s)]
*  And I want to know why. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8248.519999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've known him since long before he got into politics. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8249.339999999998s)]
*  So, I have a sense of him as a person, I think, [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8251.519999999999s)]
*  because politics does, it's a very weird business, [[02:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8255.48s)]
*  as you well know. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8258.039999999999s)]
*  Since unlike me, you still live in Washington. [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8259.92s)]
*  But from my perspective, [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8261.52s)]
*  I mean, I can't speak to why Trump chose him. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8264.8s)]
*  And it was Trump who chose him, [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8267.4s)]
*  facing enormous pressure [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8269.84s)]
*  from sleazy anti-American Republican donors [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8271.88s)]
*  who have all kinds of agendas, [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8276.76s)]
*  none of which have anything to do with life [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8278.58s)]
*  in the United States, trust me. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8280.32s)]
*  Really, really unbelievable people. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8282.56s)]
*  In a bad way. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8285.68s)]
*  But he faced them all down and chose this guy [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8286.84s)]
*  because he wanted to. [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8289.88s)]
*  So, from my perspective, [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8290.74s)]
*  the message that JD Vance's pick sent was, [[02:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8291.88s)]
*  there is more to the Trump phenomenon than just the man. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8295.2s)]
*  There's a set of ideas, or at least impulses, [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8298.28s)]
*  I don't know, ideas, but just the basic concept is, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8300.76s)]
*  a leader of a country should look out for his own country. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8304.72s)]
*  It's like, not hard. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8307.0s)]
*  And by picking JD Vance, who clearly believes that, [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8308.96s)]
*  Trump is setting up a legacy, a really meaningful legacy. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8313.78s)]
*  Like this is the direction of the party, [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8319.62s)]
*  because people can't wait for Trump to leave [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8320.66s)]
*  in the Republican party, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8323.220000000001s)]
*  and just go back to being completely bought and paid for [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8324.58s)]
*  arm of the lobbying community in Washington, [[02:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8329.58s)]
*  whether it's pharma, the banks, or certainly- [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8332.380000000001s)]
*  The power brokers of the party are excited. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8335.18s)]
*  Certainly the weapons manufacturers, the defense industry, [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8336.7s)]
*  the killing people business that goes on [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8341.02s)]
*  that's made it such a rich city. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8342.74s)]
*  Those people can't wait for Trump to leave, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8345.26s)]
*  and just put in some stooge, which is most of them, [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8347.880000000001s)]
*  and call it Trumpism or whatever, but it's the opposite. [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8351.4s)]
*  And JD Vance is like, tangible sign that Trump understands [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8354.720000000001s)]
*  that there's more to this than just him. [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8360.78s)]
*  This is a really important idea. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8362.98s)]
*  It's a very common sense idea. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8364.62s)]
*  It's the most common sense idea. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8365.94s)]
*  You can't have a democracy if the people who run the country [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8367.78s)]
*  aren't acting on the country's behalf, by definition. [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8370.06s)]
*  And it also seems like he has the most perspective [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8372.74s)]
*  out of everybody in Washington. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8374.619999999999s)]
*  Meaning he's lived in every category of American life. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8376.5s)]
*  Yes. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8380.939999999999s)]
*  And so as a result, if you have that much stored wisdom, [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8381.779999999999s)]
*  you should put it to good use. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8386.48s)]
*  I totally agree. [[02:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8387.46s)]
*  And you hate to reduce people to their biography, [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8388.74s)]
*  and we do that too much, in my view, [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8391.5s)]
*  but biography does matter. [[02:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8393.699999999999s)]
*  Like how you grew up matter. [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8396.14s)]
*  The fact that you're the son of a Marine officer [[02:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8397.3s)]
*  and grew up all around the country, [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8399.66s)]
*  like literally all around the country on bases like that, [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8401.5s)]
*  knowing you for a long time, [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8403.98s)]
*  that very much affects your worldview. [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8405.06s)]
*  That's my perception. [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8407.539999999999s)]
*  So it does matter. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8409.1s)]
*  And the best thing about JD biographically, in my opinion, [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8409.94s)]
*  is the fact that he grew up in one of these [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8413.58s)]
*  kind of sad communities, post-industrial communities [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8416.38s)]
*  in Ohio, Southern Ohio, Appalachia, [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8419.7s)]
*  and joins the Marine Corps enlisted. [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8422.38s)]
*  He's smart. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8425.1s)]
*  He winds up at Yale Law School, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8426.26s)]
*  which really is like the center of the credential factory [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8427.98s)]
*  in American life. [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8432.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8433.1s)]
*  And forget Ohio, there's not a lot of Marines [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8433.939999999999s)]
*  going to Yale. [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8435.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8436.539999999999s)]
*  Oh, right. [[02:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8437.38s)]
*  Not enlisted. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8438.42s)]
*  No, it's like literally enlisted, enlisted Marine. [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8439.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8441.9s)]
*  Like my father, you know, [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8442.74s)]
*  and the guys who tell you to be careful of [[02:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8444.02s)]
*  when they've been drinking, you know, like, [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8446.5s)]
*  and he went to be Yale Law School. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8448.58s)]
*  And then he immediately, [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8450.5s)]
*  cause it's a short step from Yale Law School [[02:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8451.46s)]
*  to private equity in the Aspen Institute. [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8453.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8456.539999999999s)]
*  And Trump is starting to rise and people are like, [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8457.38s)]
*  oh, here's our white Appalachian guy, [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8459.019999999999s)]
*  except we've already molded his brain. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8462.98s)]
*  So why don't you come to the Aspen Institute [[02:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8465.22s)]
*  and tell us all, David Brooks and all the douchebag community, [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8466.939999999999s)]
*  what it's like to be a product of this sad, [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8470.5s)]
*  you know, opioid addicted world that you're from. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8474.06s)]
*  And he does, he dutifully does. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8476.619999999999s)]
*  It's like, why wouldn't he? [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8478.339999999998s)]
*  And he does this for a couple of years. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8480.06s)]
*  And he realizes through a lot of contact with these people [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8481.339999999998s)]
*  that they're disgusting. [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8484.699999999999s)]
*  And he winds up hating them, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8486.62s)]
*  which is very much sort of my personal story. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8489.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8492.140000000001s)]
*  Like my contempt is born of like knowledge and contact. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8493.140000000001s)]
*  Like I'm not, this is not theoretical for me. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8496.26s)]
*  Like I dislike this because I know them. [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8498.18s)]
*  And I know how completely they have abandoned their duty [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8500.300000000001s)]
*  to the country. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8505.26s)]
*  And I have contempt for them for that. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8506.1s)]
*  And JD had had exactly the same experience. [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8507.140000000001s)]
*  And he's like, I know exactly who you are. [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8509.86s)]
*  I know everything you have to offer. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8512.58s)]
*  And I'm not interested. [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8514.58s)]
*  He's got the right perspective. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8515.54s)]
*  And boy, they hate him for that. [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8516.580000000002s)]
*  It's so good. [[02:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8517.820000000002s)]
*  And he's got, and unlike them, [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8518.660000000002s)]
*  he doesn't have contempt for the people [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8520.18s)]
*  that he grew up with. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8522.380000000001s)]
*  He doesn't have contempt for the voters. [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8523.220000000001s)]
*  And that's the critical element. [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8525.060000000001s)]
*  And JD, I will say is a lot like Dr. Ben Carson in this way, [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8526.54s)]
*  because Ben Carson kind of had that trajectory. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8530.34s)]
*  And once, so JD, as you pointed out, [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8533.7s)]
*  was the muse to middle America. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8536.94s)]
*  He was the muse to the unwashed American masses. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8538.580000000002s)]
*  The left loved him when he was merely an author [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8541.1s)]
*  and they could pretend like they cared about those people. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8544.02s)]
*  That was the only reason they loved him. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8546.300000000001s)]
*  And then the second he announces [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8547.58s)]
*  that he's interested in Republican politics, [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8549.18s)]
*  now he's evil. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8551.1s)]
*  Now we're gonna make up stories about him. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8552.42s)]
*  The same with Ben Carson. [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8554.140000000001s)]
*  It happens over and over and over again. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8555.18s)]
*  It's totally right. [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8558.1s)]
*  And the fact that he criticized Trump [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8558.94s)]
*  and Trump is a fascist and da-da-da-da-da [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8561.140000000001s)]
*  and basically saying the same things [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8564.7s)]
*  that David Brooks says every week [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8566.5s)]
*  or Tom Friedman or any of those other morons [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8568.18s)]
*  in the New York Times editorial page. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8570.98s)]
*  And then he like realizes that, [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8573.18s)]
*  no, actually there's like more to Trump than that. [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8574.86s)]
*  And then he ends up liking Trump. [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8577.220000000001s)]
*  And it's like pretty sincere, I think. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8578.5s)]
*  I mean, I know it is, cause I've seen it. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8580.220000000001s)]
*  And they're like, wait, you can't work for Trump. [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8582.14s)]
*  You once disliked Trump. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8585.1s)]
*  You said the same things about Trump that we say every day. [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8586.34s)]
*  Therefore it's like, what do you even say? [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8588.34s)]
*  As we're speaking, Kamala Harris is disavowing [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8590.34s)]
*  every position she's ever held. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8592.300000000001s)]
*  And the idea that you'd be critical, [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8594.66s)]
*  they're like, oh, you didn't like Trump once? [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8596.220000000001s)]
*  Well, I kind of like, kind of, [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8598.5s)]
*  I very much like people who change their views on things. [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8600.66s)]
*  Sincerely change your views. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8604.099999999999s)]
*  Don't just tailor their views to whatever's expedient, [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8604.939999999999s)]
*  but who actually have had, we used to call it growth. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8606.34s)]
*  Remember that? [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8609.26s)]
*  When people grew, they like sorted through the evidence [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8610.099999999999s)]
*  and realized they were wrong. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8614.42s)]
*  I mean, I've had that experience so many times. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8615.859999999999s)]
*  I'm sure you have also. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8617.779999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8618.74s)]

*  Tell me how wrong you were. [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8624.22s)]
*  Like admit it. [[02:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8625.34s)]
*  Admit how powerless and flawed you are. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8626.18s)]

*  and just stare at it on the floor [[02:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8637.06s)]
*  and see what fits together again. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8638.259999999998s)]
*  But those are honest people. [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8639.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8640.82s)]

*  because it's so good. [[02:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8709.62s)]

*  Obama is so mad. [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8742.42s)]

*  Well, he, I mean, there's actual evidence for this. [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8754.34s)]
*  I mean, because David Garrow's biography he wrote about. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8757.5s)]
*  I'm aware I've talked to David Garrow about it. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8760.34s)]
*  Which was like, which was. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8761.82s)]
*  And that book was, you know, it was the definitive book [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8763.66s)]
*  on Obama. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8767.779999999999s)]
*  That guy interviewed, so he won, what's the award? [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8768.619999999999s)]
*  He won an award for his MLK book, MLK biography. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8770.779999999999s)]
*  And then he goes on. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8773.74s)]
*  Was it parting the waters or I can't. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8774.58s)]
*  Something like that. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8776.34s)]
*  And then he goes on and he writes this, [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8777.34s)]
*  the most single, the single most in-depth book [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8778.94s)]
*  on Barack Obama that's ever existed. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8781.18s)]
*  He's talked to literally everybody, [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8782.66s)]
*  like Obama's mailman, everybody. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8784.14s)]
*  Like anybody who's ever had any contact. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8786.02s)]
*  Former girlfriends too. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8787.66s)]
*  Former girlfriends. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8788.74s)]
*  And that's where he got the letters [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8789.7s)]
*  where Obama was admitting his gay fantasies [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8790.94s)]
*  to a girl that he was seeing. [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8793.1s)]
*  And that was, and so the media refused to cover it, [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8794.7s)]
*  which was totally real. [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8798.02s)]
*  It was like, it's in the book. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8799.06s)]
*  There's no denying it. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8800.78s)]
*  I mean, Garrow is considered, [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8801.82s)]
*  I think one of the most authoritative biographers alive. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8804.66s)]
*  And people just get right back. [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8807.94s)]
*  And Garrow's a liberal. [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8809.94s)]
*  But I think I'm pretty sure, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8811.46s)]
*  if I can say conclusively, [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8814.98s)]
*  that Garrow came to really kind of dislike Obama [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8816.18s)]
*  and to think he was fraudulent [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8819.18s)]
*  during the writing of that book. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8820.58s)]
*  And that book was, I don't know, [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8823.06s)]
*  it wasn't banned, of course, but it was- [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8825.34s)]
*  Suppressed. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8827.86s)]
*  It was, definitely. [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8828.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8830.18s)]
*  Because it got to the core question, [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8831.02s)]
*  which is who is this guy exactly? [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8833.98s)]
*  And he clearly has a lot of talents. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8835.74s)]
*  I've always thought that about Obama. [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8837.939999999999s)]
*  But it was, he was also, [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8840.38s)]
*  there's deception at the core. [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8842.66s)]
*  Also, it kind of gives away the game [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8843.9s)]
*  because if their whole belief is that [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8845.42s)]
*  it's totally normal to be gay, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8846.9s)]
*  then why wouldn't they just feature it? [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8848.1s)]
*  Well, I completely agree with that. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8849.5s)]
*  Why wouldn't they just be like, [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8850.779999999999s)]
*  oh, this is another great detail [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8851.619999999999s)]
*  about his life that we've discovered? [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8852.779999999999s)]
*  Well, it's so weird to be on the right or wherever I am [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8854.18s)]
*  and feel like you're more liberal on this stuff [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8858.9s)]
*  than the Democratic Party, [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8861.3s)]
*  because there are plenty of people in the Democratic Party [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8862.74s)]
*  who are still closeted. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8864.699999999999s)]
*  And it's like, by the way, I do not believe in getting into, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8865.699999999999s)]
*  I think people should be allowed to reveal [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8869.42s)]
*  as much as they want about their personal lives. [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8871.46s)]
*  Privacy is really important. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8873.22s)]
*  In fact, it's essential. [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8874.38s)]
*  So it's not my place to get into that, [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8875.94s)]
*  but there are a ton. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8879.14s)]
*  But the reason these questions- [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8880.38s)]
*  Including really famous ones. [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8881.22s)]
*  And it's like, how dare you get up in everybody else [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8882.26s)]
*  and constantly lecturing everyone about their sex lives? [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8885.74s)]
*  It's your business, it's not. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8887.98s)]
*  Just shut up about everyone's sex life, okay? [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8888.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8890.74s)]
*  Two, if you're like Mr. or Ms. gay rights advocate [[02:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8891.74s)]
*  and you're closeted, like what? [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8896.86s)]
*  How can you live with yourself? [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8900.34s)]
*  Also, the core point with all of these stories is like, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8901.62s)]
*  if you're leading your life in deception, [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8905.38s)]
*  why should you have any responsibility [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8907.82s)]
*  over the rest of ours? [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8909.34s)]
*  So if you're- For power over- [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8910.42s)]
*  Yeah, if you have power, [[02:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8911.5s)]
*  it is reasonable to ask fundamental questions [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8913.26s)]
*  about what you're honest about [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8915.18s)]
*  and what you're lying about. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8916.539999999999s)]
*  Dude, I agree completely. [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8917.9s)]
*  And we all lie and it's bad, [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8919.54s)]
*  but it's like super, super basic lies, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8924.7s)]
*  ongoing lies like that. [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8927.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8928.740000000002s)]
*  It tells you a lot. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8929.94s)]
*  And as a voter, you wanna know that kind of thing. [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8930.78s)]
*  Oh, like in Kamala Harris's case, [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8932.34s)]
*  you see the intern who once worked for her, [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8934.86s)]
*  who revealed what it was like working in her office [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8938.380000000001s)]
*  in San Francisco. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8940.7s)]
*  I think it was approximately exactly what you would expect. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8942.220000000001s)]
*  Every time she walked in in the morning, [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8945.980000000001s)]
*  they had to say, good morning, general. [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8947.58s)]
*  General. [[02:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8949.38s)]
*  So like, I think a lot of people don't realize like, [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8954.14s)]
*  I guess there is like a format, [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8956.02s)]
*  there is like a formal title that you could refer [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8957.78s)]
*  to an attorney general as general, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8959.56s)]
*  but it is so preposterous that almost nobody does it. [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8960.94s)]
*  It's so stupid. [[02:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8963.38s)]
*  I know many attorneys general, many, many, more than 10. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8964.22s)]
*  And I've never called a single one of them general. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8967.02s)]
*  And to the extent that you've ever talked to them about it, [[02:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8969.62s)]
*  they're like kind of embarrassed by the concept, [[02:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8971.46s)]
*  like not actually a general, so don't say that. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8972.94s)]
*  Yeah, how many tanks do you have? [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8975.1s)]
*  Yeah, generals. [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8976.18s)]
*  So she would walk in in the morning and her expectation was [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8977.86s)]
*  that every single person would stand [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8981.460000000001s)]
*  and say good morning, general. [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8983.42s)]
*  Now, as you know, my dad is a Marine general. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8985.82s)]
*  An actual general. [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8988.82s)]
*  And he said, he told me, he's like, [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8990.74s)]
*  that story alone is told me everything [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8992.78s)]
*  I need to know about her. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8996.14s)]
*  Every single thing I need to know about her [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8997.12s)]
*  is encapsulated in that one anecdote. [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=8999.220000000001s)]
*  It's totally right. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9001.54s)]
*  You demand the interns who are not allowed [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9002.380000000001s)]
*  to make eye contact, [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9004.300000000001s)]
*  stand up when you walk in and say good morning, general. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9005.5s)]
*  You should not have your hands on the levers of power. [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9008.42s)]
*  Well, yeah, because it suggests hollowness, [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9010.74s)]
*  an insecurity of fear. [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9014.18s)]
*  I mean, again, she's terrified. [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9016.1s)]
*  This person is terrified. [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9017.78s)]
*  She's been elevated far beyond her capabilities. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9018.94s)]
*  And she knows that, of course. [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9022.58s)]
*  That's why she's so brittle. [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9024.42s)]
*  And people like that are really dangerous. [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9026.48s)]
*  They're not centered. [[02:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9029.32s)]
*  They don't have limits. [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9030.46s)]
*  We just took a break and we were laughing [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9032.74s)]
*  about all the things that we can't say on YouTube [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9034.74s)]
*  that we bleep. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9037.46s)]
*  And really, I think the only three categories are [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9038.86s)]
*  if you claim that men cannot become women [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9042.78s)]
*  by tapping their heels together and wishing it so. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9045.14s)]
*  If you claim that the 2020 election, [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9047.8s)]
*  Biden didn't really get more votes than black Jesus. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9051.02s)]
*  If you question the election in any way, [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9054.86s)]
*  and what's the third, oh, the Vax. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9057.3s)]
*  Yeah. Vax is great. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9059.699999999999s)]
*  Everything about the Vax is great, safe and effective. [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9061.02s)]
*  And if you say anything to the contrary of those, [[02:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9063.82s)]
*  you just get demonetized and then they take your channel away. [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9067.22s)]
*  But I think you can say pretty much, [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9070.34s)]
*  I think those are the only three guidance points [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9071.619999999999s)]
*  I've received. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9074.26s)]
*  Yeah, so that leaves a lot, doesn't it? [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9075.1s)]
*  So. [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9076.699999999999s)]
*  And I just wanna make it clear that I totally believe [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9077.539999999999s)]
*  in the Vax, the 2020 election and the tranny stuff. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9081.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Full blown. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9083.699999999999s)]
*  And I saw Bigfoot on the way in here. [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9084.66s)]
*  I don't know if people can hear that they say that. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9086.18s)]
*  I think I did. I saw him on the way in. [[02:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9087.699999999999s)]
*  The earth is flat, of course. [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9089.94s)]
*  100%. [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9091.779999999999s)]
*  Moon landing fake. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9092.820000000002s)]
*  The moon landing fake. [[02:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9093.94s)]
*  I came around to that. I didn't believe it. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9094.78s)]
*  CIA killed Kennedy, no problem at all. [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9096.62s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. You can say all of that. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9098.5s)]
*  But so you're saying everything we said before that, [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9100.660000000002s)]
*  nobody could hear it? [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9102.740000000002s)]
*  No, no one can hear it. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9103.660000000002s)]
*  No, no, no. I was just endorsing those views. [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9104.5s)]
*  I think the Vax is safe and effective. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9106.78s)]
*  I just wanna say that Ivermectin is for, [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9108.54s)]
*  it's a horse dewormer or something. [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9110.5s)]
*  Sure, yeah, yeah. [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9111.900000000001s)]
*  So, okay, here's my last, [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9113.060000000001s)]
*  because we're trying to turn this around today. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9114.820000000002s)]
*  So I keep going, but we have to get this into edit [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9116.12s)]
*  to bleep all the stuff that YouTube doesn't want you to hear, [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9120.42s)]
*  which you can get on our website, tuckercarlson.com, [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9123.14s)]
*  uncensored, if you like. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9125.54s)]
*  Here's my question. [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9127.42s)]
*  We both agree that there's no chance [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9128.94s)]
*  Kamala Harris gets, quote, elected president, [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9130.66s)]
*  except through the unremitting lying [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9133.98s)]
*  by the American news media. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9138.460000000001s)]
*  Like she's their candidate. [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9139.62s)]
*  They have to get her across the finish line. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9140.62s)]
*  This infuriating to me, [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9143.1s)]
*  so infuriating that I don't really watch. [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9144.26s)]
*  You have to watch, cause you have a daily show. [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9146.3s)]
*  All the dishonest media outlets out there, [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9149.460000000001s)]
*  which is basically all of them, [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9152.1s)]
*  including the Wall Street Journal, [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9154.02s)]
*  what is the most dishonest? [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9156.26s)]
*  The most dishonest. [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9160.66s)]
*  I would say, I guess the people who jump off the page [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9161.74s)]
*  at me immediately, I guess there's two shows in particular. [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9164.54s)]
*  One is Morning Joe, like the whole cast of Morning Joe. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9167.74s)]
*  They literally have a character on that show [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9173.26s)]
*  who's called Barnacle. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9175.06s)]
*  He hangs onto the show. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9176.66s)]
*  He's been hanging on for years. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9178.82s)]
*  But anyway, the point is like that show, [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9180.74s)]
*  like they'll change their attitudes on a dime [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9182.66s)]
*  just to serve whatever the left wants at any given moment. [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9185.22s)]
*  It's really sad, it's pathetic. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9187.619999999999s)]
*  And they're so angry about Trump. [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9189.5s)]
*  And so that comes out of everything. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9192.1s)]
*  But they were Trump cheerleaders. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9193.3s)]
*  They were Trump cheerleaders. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9194.82s)]
*  And now they're Biden cheerleaders, [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9195.86s)]
*  or they have been up until Biden got replaced [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9197.619999999999s)]
*  because Biden was close to them. [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9200.34s)]
*  It was the show he watched in the morning. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9202.34s)]
*  So they tailored their programming only to his interests. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9203.74s)]
*  And it's really embarrassing. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9206.18s)]
*  And I would never- [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9207.86s)]
*  So when they round you up, you and your family [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9208.7s)]
*  and put you in some camp [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9210.74s)]
*  or put you on trial for thought crimes, [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9211.66s)]
*  do you think Morning Joe will defend you? [[02:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9213.02s)]
*  Will mount a defense for me? [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9215.42s)]
*  Just on principle. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9217.34s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9218.18s)]
*  And I don't think this clip will be the reason for that. [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9219.02s)]
*  I think, literally, they already know what to think of me. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9221.26s)]
*  And then- [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9225.18s)]
*  I know all those people very well. [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9226.300000000001s)]
*  And it's sad to see it. [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9227.98s)]
*  I mean, Joe Scarborough is like not stupid at all. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9229.34s)]
*  Joe Scarborough is actually smart. [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9232.02s)]
*  Not that that matters. [[02:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9233.94s)]
*  There's a lot of bad, smart people, but he is not stupid. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9234.94s)]
*  He's much smarter than your average cable news person. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9238.66s)]
*  But what they're doing doesn't represent, [[02:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9241.42s)]
*  like he was a Florida congressman. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9244.220000000001s)]
*  And then he left and then there was- [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9246.300000000001s)]
*  Who's represented by, like who in Florida would say, [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9247.980000000001s)]
*  yeah, that guy's just speaking for me? [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9251.460000000001s)]
*  No, no, but what I'm saying is like he know, [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9252.74s)]
*  like Don Lamont, someone like that, you think, [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9254.54s)]
*  well, does he really know what he's saying? [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9257.460000000001s)]
*  Right. [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9260.82s)]
*  No, not really. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9261.66s)]
*  I don't think he does. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9262.980000000001s)]
*  I don't think he has any idea what he's saying, actually, [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9263.82s)]
*  which kind of makes me sort of like him. [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9265.82s)]
*  Joe Scarborough knows exactly what he's doing. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9267.699999999999s)]
*  That's all I'm saying. [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9269.86s)]
*  Well, yeah, yeah. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9271.42s)]
*  He's tactical in his presentation. [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9272.26s)]
*  No question. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9274.9s)]
*  I mean, and somehow he's thrived and missed all of this. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9275.74s)]
*  Like he and Mika got married [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9277.34s)]
*  and now they do the show in Florida [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9279.98s)]
*  and they pretend they're in DC. [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9282.02s)]
*  And it's like, it's all very weird. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9283.3s)]
*  How's that going? [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9284.66s)]
*  Do they look happy? [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9285.5s)]
*  I haven't seen it in a while. [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9286.32s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9287.16s)]
*  Is that working for them? [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9288.0s)]
*  I can't, I don't know. [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9290.14s)]
*  There's so much phoniness on TV. [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9291.74s)]
*  So it's like everyone's always pretending to be. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9292.98s)]
*  I know. [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9294.779999999999s)]
*  I don't think it's working that well. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9295.619999999999s)]
*  As you know. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9296.46s)]
*  I don't think it's working that well. [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9297.3s)]
*  The other show that stands out to me [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9298.14s)]
*  that's like so cartoonish, [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9299.619999999999s)]
*  but it does have like millions of viewers is The View. [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9300.619999999999s)]
*  Have you actually seen The View? [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9303.539999999999s)]
*  Not like beginning to end. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9305.14s)]
*  I'm a clip consumer of The View. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9306.779999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9308.26s)]
*  Like just like a lot of people. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9309.1s)]
*  Like I will never allow somebody to tell me what happened [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9309.939999999999s)]
*  and then just reinterpret that event in that way. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9314.46s)]
*  Like I hate that. [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9316.42s)]
*  Like that happens all the way. [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9317.26s)]
*  It happened to you like throughout your entire career, [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9318.1s)]
*  but especially when you're on Fox. [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9320.06s)]
*  Like the left always had these views of you [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9321.460000000001s)]
*  that weren't filtered through watching a clip of your show [[02:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9323.06s)]
*  or even, or certainly not the entire show. [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9325.22s)]
*  It was literally what some lefty outlet told them about you. [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9327.62s)]
*  That's their interpretation. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9330.74s)]
*  And they never get it right. [[02:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9331.58s)]
*  I mean, I always feel like I have all kinds of obvious faults. [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9332.42s)]
*  I have definitely have some pretty serious bigotries. [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9334.94s)]
*  They're just not racial bigotries, [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9338.94s)]
*  but do you know what I mean? [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9341.34s)]
*  They always got it wrong. [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9342.38s)]
*  They always, you won't tolerate certain things. [[02:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9343.34s)]
*  That's what bigotry means. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9345.5s)]
*  There are certain kinds of people I don't like at all [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9346.5s)]
*  in a very unreasonable way, [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9349.78s)]
*  but they're not black people actually. [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9351.5s)]
*  They're affluent, a lot of affluent whites. [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9353.26s)]
*  I just don't like them, [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9355.980000000001s)]
*  especially some of the ladies. [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9357.54s)]
*  I just don't like them. [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9360.220000000001s)]
*  The ones who scream at you. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9361.060000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the ones who scream at me. [[02:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9362.18s)]
*  And by the way, I'm not defending that. [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9363.02s)]
*  That's bigotry, but it's not the kind of bigotry [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9364.18s)]
*  they're always accusing me of. [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9366.820000000002s)]
*  Which it was like, yeah, you're right. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9368.220000000001s)]
*  I'm a bad person, but in a very different way. [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9370.18s)]
*  Can you be more accurate? [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9371.86s)]
*  But if she comes lumbering towards you with blue hair, [[02:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9373.820000000002s)]
*  like you and her mask, [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9376.140000000001s)]
*  but you kind of have a read on which way this is going. [[02:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9377.7s)]
*  Yeah, but you shouldn't judge people without knowing them. [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9380.060000000001s)]
*  I think, but I do in that way, but it was never, [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9383.54s)]
*  they were always like, you know, whatever. [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9386.62s)]
*  Anyway, no, it's- [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9388.060000000001s)]
*  Do people yell at you less now? [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9389.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, never anymore. [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9390.94s)]
*  I don't go anywhere. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9391.980000000001s)]
*  Wait, but I mean, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9393.1s)]
*  on the few times that you're at an airport, for instance, [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9393.94s)]
*  do they yell less? [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9395.820000000002s)]
*  Yeah, not at all anymore. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9396.900000000001s)]
*  Oh, that's good. [[02:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9398.26s)]
*  It's interesting. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9399.1s)]
*  I don't really know what that's about. [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9399.92s)]
*  Well, you know, not having your face on Fox [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9401.380000000001s)]
*  and then the media pretending like you don't exist. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9403.54s)]
*  Meanwhile, you have the number one podcast [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9406.02s)]
*  in the country. [[02:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9408.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9409.14s)]
*  Basically all the lefties who would be conditioned [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9409.98s)]
*  to yell at you don't consume whatever, [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9411.78s)]
*  whatever one has is consuming. [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9413.7s)]
*  I never cared. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9414.54s)]
*  It never bothered me. [[02:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9415.46s)]
*  Just don't come to my house. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9416.54s)]
*  You know, that was always my view. [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9417.74s)]
*  So anyway, the view, I haven't seen the view in a long time. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9419.38s)]
*  It's just, it's like, it's like, [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9421.9s)]
*  it's over the top, like comical cheerleading [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9423.98s)]
*  for like everything the left is for. [[02:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9426.08s)]
*  And they're always against Trump at all odds, [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9427.7s)]
*  like at all costs, no matter what he does. [[02:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9429.74s)]
*  He's always guilty of everything. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9432.46s)]
*  He was rightly prosecuted [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9433.86s)]
*  by every Democrat prosecutor in the country. [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9435.58s)]
*  He should be in jail. [[02:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9438.18s)]
*  It's like, it's just. [[02:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9439.02s)]
*  Is Joe Farris daughter still on there? [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9440.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9442.42s)]
*  And nobody talks about that. [[02:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9443.26s)]
*  He is such a nice man. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9444.58s)]
*  Joe Farris is a nice man. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9446.3s)]
*  And he had this very low, low, low daughter. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9447.74s)]
*  It's that World Net Daily, right? [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9450.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9452.18s)]
*  And he's just a nice guy. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9453.02s)]
*  Was Joseph Farris. [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9453.86s)]
*  I've known him like 30 years and he's just a nice person. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9454.7s)]
*  And, but he had this daughter was like an idiot and sad. [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9458.02s)]
*  And she went up in the view, I heard. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9464.26s)]
*  Yeah, nobody holds the Joseph Farris thing against her. [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9467.34s)]
*  Like, meaning I realized that you wouldn't hold it [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9470.02s)]
*  against her, but what I'm saying is like the left [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9474.7s)]
*  for years demonized World Net Daily and Joe Farris. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9477.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9479.34s)]
*  So like under like, I guess normal circumstances [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9480.18s)]
*  anything even related to him, they would demonize [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9484.1s)]
*  but not so with her, like she's on the show [[02:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9486.94s)]
*  and nobody even brings it up. [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9488.74s)]
*  Like nobody. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9490.22s)]
*  She's, as I remember is the kind of person who will just say [[02:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9491.06s)]
*  whatever it takes to get the acceptance [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9493.7s)]
*  of the people around her. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9496.22s)]
*  Is she like a regime defender? [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9497.74s)]
*  Almost entirely. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9499.14s)]
*  Occasionally she'll like issue like a squeak of moderation [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9500.26s)]
*  in the midst of all of their babbling, but no [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9503.14s)]
*  for the most part a regime defender. [[02:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9505.58s)]
*  Yeah, well she's really sad and. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9506.42s)]
*  Stupid and easy to control. [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9508.019999999999s)]
*  Like a lot of people on TV. [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9509.5s)]
*  It's awful. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9510.66s)]
*  But then like, of course it was like Joy Behar [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9512.34s)]
*  who like once wore blackface and she's still like [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9514.539999999999s)]
*  on the show and you know, Whoopi Goldberg [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9516.779999999999s)]
*  who like clearly doesn't do any research. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9519.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9521.3s)]
*  She just wings it entirely, which is funny. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9522.14s)]
*  Joy Behar, so I did The View once 20 years ago [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9524.86s)]
*  when I worked at CNN, the PR department pushed me [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9527.82s)]
*  to do The View and the only thing Barbara Walters [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9529.900000000001s)]
*  was there, I remember that. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9532.86s)]
*  I remember thinking the whole thing was like so mindless [[02:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9534.140000000001s)]
*  but Joy Behar was like the screechiest human being [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9535.78s)]
*  I'd ever met in my life. [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9537.980000000001s)]
*  Is she still that way? [[02:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9540.140000000001s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9541.980000000001s)]
*  Maybe worse, probably worse. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9543.66s)]
*  Really? [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9545.7s)]
*  Yeah, probably worse. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9546.54s)]
*  It is crazy. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9548.300000000001s)]
*  And do you think that. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9549.980000000001s)]
*  Like any world in which Whoopi Goldberg is moderating [[02:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9551.34s)]
*  whatever meaningful, whatever little debates [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9553.82s)]
*  might be breaking out at the table is like crazy. [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9556.34s)]
*  One last question, do you think like, [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9559.22s)]
*  I know that there are very, very few Republican donors [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9561.9s)]
*  who are worth much, unfortunately. [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9566.02s)]
*  There are some, but not a ton. [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9568.74s)]
*  But I always felt like a show like The View [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9570.5s)]
*  and a person like Joy Behar, [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9572.66s)]
*  that could be such a brilliant disinformation campaign. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9574.94s)]
*  Someone who's so unappealing, so like prima facie repulsive [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9577.14s)]
*  that she pushes people away from her position. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9582.3s)]
*  Could it be that Joy Behar is actually getting funding [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9585.66s)]
*  from ex-Republican donor to discredit [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9588.18s)]
*  the other party's program? [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9591.9s)]
*  She works for Elon. [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9592.98s)]
*  You do kind of wonder, and she's still that way. [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9594.58s)]
*  Yeah, she is. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9597.3s)]
*  She's gotta be 150 years old at this point. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9598.14s)]
*  It's so crazy. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9600.619999999999s)]
*  I don't even really know how like she got jobs. [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9602.38s)]
*  Like wasn't she on CNN at one point? [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9605.46s)]
*  She had like a headline. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9607.5s)]
*  I don't know, not when I was there. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9608.34s)]
*  I think it was after you were there. [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9610.42s)]
*  Anyway, the point is like it still exists. [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9612.14s)]
*  They're still crazy. [[02:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9615.3s)]
*  It makes for great fodder for clips. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9616.38s)]
*  I mean, I love clips from the show [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9618.34s)]
*  because it's so ridiculous. [[02:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9619.86s)]
*  It's so easy to eviscerate. [[02:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9621.02s)]
*  It's like Ben Shapiro debating a college student. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9622.22s)]
*  It's like the easiest stuff. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9624.58s)]
*  It's funny. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9627.02s)]
*  Yeah, thank heaven for that. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9627.86s)]
*  A daily show would be impossible [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9629.1s)]
*  without the rest of the media. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9631.18s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9632.38s)]
*  I remember certain days when I had a daily show. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9633.22s)]
*  Thank heaven, I don't do that anymore. [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9634.9s)]
*  But people are like, oh my gosh, it's August. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9636.06s)]
*  Like, what are we talking about? [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9638.699999999999s)]
*  This is before the news went totally crazy all times. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9639.58s)]
*  But there's always some Tom Fox, our genius producer, [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9642.94s)]
*  would always be like, what? [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9647.26s)]
*  I don't know what to write about tonight. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9649.26s)]
*  He'd be like, I'll send you some clips. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9650.58s)]
*  And they would piss me off so completely. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9652.06s)]
*  Yes. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9654.18s)]
*  You have like Don Lemon saying [[02:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9655.38s)]
*  that a plane disappeared into a black hole. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9656.58s)]
*  And you're like, of course we have to do that. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9658.7s)]
*  But actually now that I think about it, [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9659.78s)]
*  that may be the one thing he was right about. [[02:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9661.539999999999s)]
*  I was just thinking that exact same thing. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9663.42s)]
*  That was the old Don Lemon. [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9664.7s)]
*  That was like Don Lamon before he decided to do whatever. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9666.18s)]
*  That was open-minded Don Lemon. [[02:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9669.1s)]
*  Totally. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9670.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9671.460000000001s)]
*  And I remember mocking him and being like, [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9672.300000000001s)]
*  oh, that's so stupid. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9674.02s)]
*  Compared to what? [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9676.380000000001s)]
*  Like, what's the real answer? [[02:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9677.220000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and like, I think it was, [[02:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9679.34s)]
*  I think when he said that, [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9680.62s)]
*  there was like a panel of people on [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9681.460000000001s)]
*  and everyone looked so embarrassed [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9682.66s)]
*  that he said it out loud. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9684.18s)]
*  Yes. [[02:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9685.460000000001s)]
*  But he stuck to it and that was his greatest moment. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9686.300000000001s)]
*  Yes, I totally actually, [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9688.34s)]
*  I'll end with this, his greatest moment ever. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9690.300000000001s)]
*  And I think, correct me if I got this wrong, [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9692.140000000001s)]
*  but he was profiled by like Atlanta Magazine or something. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9694.86s)]
*  Do you remember this? [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9698.22s)]
*  I remember. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9699.06s)]
*  I don't remember the magazine specifically, [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9699.9s)]
*  but I think I know where it is. [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9700.74s)]
*  I may be getting this wrong, [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9701.58s)]
*  but he's sitting and the reporter is a female reporter, [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9702.42s)]
*  very good writer, this woman. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9704.539999999999s)]
*  I think I know her, but whatever. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9706.539999999999s)]
*  Anyway, she was, I can't remember who it was, [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9707.42s)]
*  but she's having lunch with Don Lamon [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9708.98s)]
*  and he's like, you know, in journalism, [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9711.26s)]
*  you know, think about journalism, Vince, [[02:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9713.46s)]
*  those who have been chosen to practice it, [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9715.82s)]
*  to stride its hallowed halls, [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9718.46s)]
*  men like Woodward and Bernstein and myself. [[02:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9721.179999999998s)]
*  And he's just giving this impossibly pompous lecture. [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9723.74s)]
*  And the waiter comes up and he's also like fussy and pompous. [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9728.62s)]
*  And Don Lamon goes, I'd like some lemon sorbet. [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9732.140000000001s)]
*  And the pompous, fussy waiter goes, [[02:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9737.42s)]
*  sure, it's actually pronounced sorbet, [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9739.42s)]
*  which is like devastating, [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9742.34s)]
*  actually mispronounced the name of the dessert. [[02:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9743.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9745.18s)]
*  You pompous dude. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9746.02s)]
*  After trying to impress your dinner guest [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9746.84s)]
*  with how impressive you are. [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9747.94s)]
*  But Don Lamon is living in this like airtight bubble [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9748.980000000001s)]
*  of self-esteem that's just impregnable. [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9752.9s)]
*  Like you can't violate Don's self-esteem. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9756.18s)]
*  It's just, it's bulletproof. [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9758.42s)]
*  And so he goes, no, no, my man, it's pronounced sorbet. [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9760.220000000001s)]
*  I'm like, I love you. [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9766.7s)]
*  Because you're so stupid, but it's real. [[02:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9768.54s)]
*  Please talk to us guys. [[02:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9770.78s)]
*  That's the best, bring back that Don Lamon. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9772.380000000001s)]
*  Totally agree. [[02:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9774.42s)]
*  Vince, thank you. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9776.06s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9776.9s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9777.74s)]
*  I know. [[02:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9783.26s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year, [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9784.1s)]
*  with everything at stake, [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9786.3s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9787.619999999999s)]
*  and preventing you from hearing anything [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9790.26s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9793.46s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[02:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9795.34s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9796.94s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it, [[02:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9797.78s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9799.34s)]
*  We're not in charge of Google. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9800.46s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9801.9s)]
*  A way that you could actually get information that's true. [[02:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9803.74s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9807.78s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9809.58s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9811.1s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9812.939999999999s)]
*  is to subscribe to our channel. [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9814.939999999999s)]
*  Subscribe, and you will have a much higher chance [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9816.9s)]
*  of hearing what we say. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9820.779999999999s)]
*  And we hope you will. [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQqGDt54y9w&t=9821.699999999999s)]
