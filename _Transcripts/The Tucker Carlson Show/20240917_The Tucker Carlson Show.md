# Tucker Carlson, RFK Jr, and Larry Elder React to Second Trump Shooting
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [September 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3.0s)]
*  I'm really happy to be here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=8.0s)]
*  I've spent, thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=12.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=20.0s)]
*  It's so funny. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=29.0s)]
*  I was just in this building in July. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=30.0s)]
*  I had no idea it was the same building until it was pulling up tonight. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=33.0s)]
*  I was thinking, that looks very familiar. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=37.0s)]
*  I'm so grateful to be here. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=41.0s)]
*  I am, actually. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=45.0s)]
*  And I just want to be clear, I like every part of the United States. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=47.0s)]
*  I'm from here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=50.0s)]
*  I was born here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=51.0s)]
*  I will die here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=52.0s)]
*  Hopefully not too soon. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=53.0s)]
*  But I've made that commitment. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=56.0s)]
*  And I'm going to be buried near my dogs. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=58.0s)]
*  But I love the whole country. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=61.0s)]
*  I grew up on one coast. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=63.0s)]
*  I live on the other. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=64.0s)]
*  Whoever clapped for me being buried next to my dogs, I like you. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=65.0s)]
*  Because I feel that way. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=68.0s)]
*  But I have to say, and this is not pandering, this is totally sincere, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=70.0s)]
*  I especially love this part of the Midwest. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=75.0s)]
*  I just love it. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=78.0s)]
*  And I love it for incredibly shallow reasons. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=80.0s)]
*  First of all, I love to hunt and fish here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=86.0s)]
*  I love your muskies. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=90.0s)]
*  I love your grouse. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=92.0s)]
*  The friends who I go on an annual hunting trip with in two weeks. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=94.0s)]
*  The first thing I'm doing when I get off tour is coming back to Wisconsin. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=98.0s)]
*  To catch your fish and try to shoot your birds. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=103.0s)]
*  I probably won't. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=106.0s)]
*  Don't worry, they're safe. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=107.0s)]
*  But the real reason I love the Midwest, particularly this part of it, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=109.0s)]
*  is because I married a girl from this area. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=113.0s)]
*  And I just love the accent. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=115.0s)]
*  I think it's hilarious. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=118.0s)]
*  I've been with her 40 years next week. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=120.0s)]
*  I met her 40 years ago next week. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=122.0s)]
*  And when I first started dating her, I thought, you know, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=125.0s)]
*  I'm sure the accent will sort of lighten up a little bit over time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=128.0s)]
*  It has not at all. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=133.0s)]
*  It's still a car, a car, which is like a motor vehicle. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=136.0s)]
*  If I say to my dogs, let's go to the park, they look at me like, what? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=140.0s)]
*  But if I say the park, bam, they're up. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=145.0s)]
*  And so I associate that accent with niceness and particularly nice women. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=149.0s)]
*  So I'm walking through downtown Milwaukee today, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=154.0s)]
*  and I hear people speaking in the sex, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=157.0s)]
*  and I almost want to walk up and introduce myself and be like, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=159.0s)]
*  oh, it's so nice to meet you. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=162.0s)]
*  And I thought, you know, maybe, I don't know, maybe you get shot doing that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=164.0s)]
*  But everyone actually was nice. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=168.0s)]
*  I just think it's just the sweetest part of the country. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=170.0s)]
*  So thank you so much. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=172.0s)]
*  We have it even in my kitchen, the Midwestern sensibility. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=175.0s)]
*  We're very big on meatloaf in my house, actually. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=179.0s)]
*  I don't even know if they still serve it here, but in the 70s in the Midwest, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=182.0s)]
*  everyone ate meatloaf every day, and so we still do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=185.0s)]
*  So the reason that it's funny, the reason that we're doing this tour, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=189.0s)]
*  we're doing this is where this is our eighth night, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=194.0s)]
*  and we're doing the entire month of September. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=197.0s)]
*  And the real reason I wanted to do it was it became, I now work on the Internet. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=199.0s)]
*  And before then, I worked in television. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=204.0s)]
*  And the frustrating thing about, I know, yeah, OK. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=207.0s)]
*  The frustrating thing about both of them is, you know, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=210.0s)]
*  there's a lot of censorship, and now more than ever. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=214.0s)]
*  And so I just thought to myself, the one thing that you can't censor is a live event. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=217.0s)]
*  You know, you can really be completely honest because the people are right there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=222.0s)]
*  And if you're, you know, in a room full of thousands of people, you can feel, you know, very strong. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=227.0s)]
*  Now I'm revealing it from California, but a vibe coming off the people. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=234.0s)]
*  And it's just wonderful. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=237.0s)]
*  And people can be as honest as they want, which is extremely honest. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=239.0s)]
*  And so I thought, I just need to do that after spending all day worried about what YouTube is doing to our videos. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=243.0s)]
*  I just want to get out and talk to people directly. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=249.0s)]
*  So after eight days, I'm thinking, you know, maybe I overstated it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=251.0s)]
*  You know, maybe the censorship, the distortion of the facts, the lying, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=254.0s)]
*  the massive deception machine I've been a part of for 33 years now in the media, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=258.0s)]
*  maybe it's not as bad as I thought. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=263.0s)]
*  And then someone tries to shoot Trump again. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=266.0s)]
*  I was here actually the last time someone tried to shoot Trump. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=270.0s)]
*  I was here in this room. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=273.0s)]
*  And now I'm back again two days after. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=276.0s)]
*  And I am shocked watching the lying in real time. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=278.0s)]
*  Shocked. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=283.0s)]
*  I was, was it two days ago? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=286.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden we're getting these reports. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=289.0s)]
*  I call in there and get all the facts. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=291.0s)]
*  And then I thought, you know, what are they saying in the media about it? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=293.0s)]
*  And the first thing if you tuned in that you learned was that he was shot by a Trump supporter, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=295.0s)]
*  which totally makes sense. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=302.0s)]
*  The guy loved him so much he brought a rifle to the golf course and tried to murder him. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=304.0s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of the way it works. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=308.0s)]
*  It's like Putin blowing up his own natural gas pipeline. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=309.0s)]
*  That makes sense. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=312.0s)]
*  Totally. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=313.0s)]
*  He's so evil, he's attacking himself. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=314.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=317.0s)]
*  Self-harm. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=319.0s)]
*  Like sort of the natural. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=321.0s)]
*  And I'm watching this. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=324.0s)]
*  They're literally telling me that this guy whom they've arrested is a Trump supporter. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=325.0s)]
*  Huh? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=330.0s)]
*  So you flip channels and then you learn that I flipped over to a channel I used to work on. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=331.0s)]
*  And there's Lindsey Graham. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=336.0s)]
*  And I know, I know, I know. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=339.0s)]
*  He's a Republican senator from one of the most conservative states. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=342.0s)]
*  How does that happen, by the way? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=345.0s)]
*  If democracy is real, how is Lindsey Graham a senator? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=347.0s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=350.0s)]
*  So I'm watching Lindsey Graham and Lindsey Graham's looking right into the camera. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=352.0s)]
*  He's like, you know who did this? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=355.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=357.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=359.0s)]
*  So I looked into this. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=361.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's for sure. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=362.0s)]
*  Well, it turns out someone just yelled, warmonger. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=363.0s)]
*  Well, the guy who shot Trump was also a warmonger. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=365.0s)]
*  And in fact, the closer you look at it, the more you realize his politics are exactly the same as Lindsey Graham's. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=368.0s)]
*  He's a neocon. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=376.0s)]
*  He literally volunteered in Ukraine. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=378.0s)]
*  And Lindsey Graham's like, no, Iran did it. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=382.0s)]
*  It's like, no, you have no opinions that are different from this guy's. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=384.0s)]
*  And you're lying to me. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=389.0s)]
*  And the audience I used to speak to five nights a week, you were lying to them. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=390.0s)]
*  I'm shouting this in my hotel room. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=394.0s)]
*  Nobody heard me. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=396.0s)]
*  My wife was brushing her teeth. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=397.0s)]
*  She's like, what is that? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=398.0s)]
*  They're lying. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=399.0s)]
*  It drove me completely insane. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=403.0s)]
*  And there's no mention of the fact that this guy, who, by the way, has been interviewed by every media outlet in Washington, this guy was like a very famous guy. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=407.0s)]
*  You may not even know this. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=415.0s)]
*  There's only really one place to learn any facts at all. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=417.0s)]
*  And that's Elon Musk's social media app. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=422.0s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=427.0s)]
*  I don't have a TV at home, so I'm spared most of this. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=429.0s)]
*  I have no idea what's going on. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=433.0s)]
*  By the way, I strongly recommend ignorance. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=434.0s)]
*  If you're looking to stay happy in a moment like this, just know less. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=437.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, my job requires me to know more. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=441.0s)]
*  But if you think about it, did God punish Adam and Eve for ignorance? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=444.0s)]
*  I don't think he did. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=448.0s)]
*  He punished them for knowledge. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=450.0s)]
*  So maybe I shouldn't watch cable news. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=452.0s)]
*  This was my I don't want to know what they're saying. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=454.0s)]
*  But this week I've had to pay close attention. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=457.0s)]
*  And every single thing is a lie either directly or it's a lie much more prevalent and much more sinister. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=460.0s)]
*  It's a lie by omission. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=469.0s)]
*  They're just not telling you the facts. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=471.0s)]
*  And without belaboring the point, I'm using this as just one example among a countless number of examples where reality is completely distorted [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=473.0s)]
*  and the average person has not only no idea but no way of knowing what the truth is. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=482.0s)]
*  So the guy who is now in custody for attempted murder against the Republican nominee, the former U.S. president, Donald Trump, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=486.0s)]
*  that guy has been interviewed countless times by every big media outlet in the United States. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=494.0s)]
*  He's got a criminal record the length of your arm, 20 charges, including possession of weapons of mass destruction. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=500.0s)]
*  The New York Times didn't bother learn any of that before they held him up as a freedom fighter in Ukraine where he was living. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=507.0s)]
*  And then the piece describes the contact he's had with members of Congress and their staffs and other U.S. government agencies. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=513.0s)]
*  Wait a second, that's the same guy who brought a rifle with a scope to a golf course in South Florida to murder Donald Trump [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=519.0s)]
*  and he's had all these contacts with U.S. government agencies? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=527.0s)]
*  I don't know what that's about. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=529.0s)]
*  But I think it's time to find out. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=532.0s)]
*  No? Yes. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=534.0s)]
*  But no one's going to find out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=539.0s)]
*  It's just going to be memory holding. In a week it will never have happened. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=541.0s)]
*  And you'll be the crazy person for remembering. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=544.0s)]
*  People are like, what? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=547.0s)]
*  Didn't some Trump supporter bring a rifle because you're against gun control or something? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=549.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no. That's not what happened. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=553.0s)]
*  A guy who was a darling of the New York Times, who has the exact same worldview as Lindsey Graham, decided to try and murder Donald Trump. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=556.0s)]
*  And it will be completely gone. It will have disappeared. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=565.0s)]
*  And so I guess what I would say is that it's of vital importance to get unfiltered information from honest people. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=568.0s)]
*  Now, how do you know honest people? [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=576.0s)]
*  How do you know if someone is being honest? It's very hard. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=578.0s)]
*  But one of the main reasons you know, I don't know what you're saying, but I know that I agree with you. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=581.0s)]
*  If I could hear you, I would shout back whatever you're shouting because I feel like you're on. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=586.0s)]
*  From the pitch of your voice, I can tell you're on to something. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=591.0s)]
*  Well, I love you too. I heard that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=594.0s)]
*  So here's the answer to the question. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=599.0s)]
*  How do you know if someone is telling the truth? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=602.0s)]
*  And this has been my obsession for the last year, having worked in the middle of the deception machine and not even realizing it. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=606.0s)]
*  You know, until the day you get fired, you're like, what was it like having an alcoholic spouse? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=615.0s)]
*  Everyone knows except you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=618.0s)]
*  So I'm very fixated on this fact, which is that almost all of the information that we received has been curated and spun and reduced in size. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=621.0s)]
*  Relevant facts have been omitted. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=634.0s)]
*  Irrelevant facts have been pushed to the fore in order to manipulate how we feel. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=636.0s)]
*  And so how do you defeat that? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=641.0s)]
*  Well, one of the main way that you defeat that, your first line of defense are your instincts. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=643.0s)]
*  I have come to believe this. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=650.0s)]
*  You know when someone's lying. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=652.0s)]
*  You can feel it. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=655.0s)]
*  And I know this because I have so many dogs. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=656.0s)]
*  Here's no, I'm serious. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=659.0s)]
*  My dogs cannot speak English that I'm aware of. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=661.0s)]
*  And yet, if you come to my house and you're weird, my dogs know immediately. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=664.0s)]
*  They can smell weirdness on you. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=669.0s)]
*  They can smell deception on you. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=671.0s)]
*  They don't like you at all. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=672.0s)]
*  They will bark at you. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=673.0s)]
*  They will cower in the corner. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=674.0s)]
*  Now, how is that? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=676.0s)]
*  They don't. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=677.0s)]
*  They haven't seen your tax returns. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=678.0s)]
*  They haven't talked to your wife, but they know. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=679.0s)]
*  And they know because we all know. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=683.0s)]
*  If you get a vibe off someone that suggests deception, that person is lying. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=687.0s)]
*  If you get a vibe that suggests weirdness, Tim Walls, for example. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=693.0s)]
*  I'm just saying. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=697.0s)]
*  First of all, I went to boarding school in the 80s in New England, okay? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=701.0s)]
*  We had doormasters like Mr. Walls. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=705.0s)]
*  The second I saw that guy, I was like, he's not babysitting in my house. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=710.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=713.0s)]
*  No way. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=714.0s)]
*  Oh, that's so unfair. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=715.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=716.0s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=717.0s)]
*  Because my instincts didn't just alert me to this. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=718.0s)]
*  They screamed at full volume. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=721.0s)]
*  This guy's a creeper. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=723.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=724.0s)]
*  Therefore, I don't have the evidence necessary to indict in a court of law. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=725.0s)]
*  I don't. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=732.0s)]
*  I'm not going to press charges against him while someone may at some point. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=733.0s)]
*  It's not going to be me because I don't have the information. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=736.0s)]
*  I have the instinct and that's all I need. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=739.0s)]
*  And the same is true, very true for deception. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=741.0s)]
*  And if you're watching someone, I don't want to name names because I don't mean Lindsey Graham, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=744.0s)]
*  and you look at that person and you're like, I think that person is trying to sell me something. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=748.0s)]
*  I think that person may not be telling the full truth. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=753.0s)]
*  You are right. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=756.0s)]
*  You are right. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=757.0s)]
*  Our main weakness as people is that we override the truth as delivered by our instincts by our higher mind. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=758.0s)]
*  And we talk ourselves out of knowing what we already know. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=765.0s)]
*  You already know. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=769.0s)]
*  And you know because God gave you those instincts as maybe the most important gift you received at birth to protect you from deception and harm. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=771.0s)]
*  Your instincts are not trying to sell you something. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=782.0s)]
*  They're not trying to get elected to anything. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=786.0s)]
*  Their only job is to serve you. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=788.0s)]
*  So do not ignore them. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=791.0s)]
*  You know lying when you hear it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=793.0s)]
*  I felt this during Covid. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=796.0s)]
*  I don't think I passed high school biology. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=798.0s)]
*  Pretty sure I didn't. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=801.0s)]
*  I may have gotten the answers on the test from my then girlfriend, now my wife. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=803.0s)]
*  Actually, I did. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=808.0s)]
*  I'll just be honest. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=809.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=810.0s)]
*  I cheated. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=811.0s)]
*  I did. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=812.0s)]
*  I've never admitted that to anyone. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=813.0s)]
*  Don't tell my children. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=815.0s)]
*  But that's true. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=816.0s)]
*  I just didn't understand it. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=817.0s)]
*  And so I cannot pretend to be grounded in the hard sciences because I'm not. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=819.0s)]
*  I'm deeply grounded in human nature and in the way that people communicate because that is my job. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=823.0s)]
*  And when they started telling me things on television, I knew instantly they were lying. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=828.0s)]
*  I had no idea why. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=834.0s)]
*  I didn't know what the larger purpose was. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=835.0s)]
*  I still have no idea. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=838.0s)]
*  I can speculate. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=841.0s)]
*  I won't do it here. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=842.0s)]
*  What was that? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=843.0s)]
*  What was the point of that? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=844.0s)]
*  Well, to increase their power, to make weed stores more profitable and close down churches. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=846.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got that. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=852.0s)]
*  But what was the big picture goal of that? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=853.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=857.0s)]
*  But I knew the first day when I watched Tony Fauci talk on my show, I interviewed him. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=858.0s)]
*  I had no idea Tony Fauci was lying. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=864.0s)]
*  I booked Tony Fauci. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=866.0s)]
*  Tony Fauci is like the longest serving federal employee. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=868.0s)]
*  He lives in my neighborhood in D.C. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=870.0s)]
*  Yeah, lock him up. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=872.0s)]
*  Well, he's not locked up. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=874.0s)]
*  He's wandering through our dog park with Secret Service protection at your expense, by the way. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=875.0s)]
*  Do you have Secret Service protection? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=880.0s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=882.0s)]
*  He hasn't been locked up. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=883.0s)]
*  He's been rewarded in Georgetown University. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=884.0s)]
*  He's paying him even more money in federal tax dollars as a hero. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=886.0s)]
*  But I, on the basis of no evidence whatsoever, only an erring instinct, saw Tony Fauci in that interview. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=891.0s)]
*  And I was like, you're lying. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=899.0s)]
*  I didn't say that on TV, but I felt it so strongly. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=901.0s)]
*  And I spent the next week trying to figure out what he was lying about. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=904.0s)]
*  And then it became really obvious. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=906.0s)]
*  All of us are capable of that. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=908.0s)]
*  Every one of us is capable of that. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=910.0s)]
*  And the truth, by contrast, hits very differently. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=912.0s)]
*  When you hear somebody tell a true thing, say something out loud, something you never heard before, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=914.0s)]
*  something you've heard a million times but never thought about, when you hear a true word, [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=920.0s)]
*  it resonates within you like a tuning fork. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=926.0s)]
*  It hums. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=930.0s)]
*  You can't get it out of your head. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=931.0s)]
*  You may not know why it's true, but you know that it is. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=933.0s)]
*  The word, the true word, is the most powerful force in the world. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=937.0s)]
*  In the beginning was the word. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=944.0s)]
*  And when we hear something true, we know it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=949.0s)]
*  And the only reason that we don't act on it is because we've been talked out of it by professional liars [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=954.0s)]
*  or we doubt our own gut instincts about it. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=961.0s)]
*  And so what I would say to you is, do not doubt your instincts. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=965.0s)]
*  If you see someone, if you see Carmella Harris up there saying, vote for me, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=969.0s)]
*  I'm actually a farmer from downstate Illinois. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=974.0s)]
*  You can see the black earth in my hand. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=978.0s)]
*  That's my tractor behind me. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=981.0s)]
*  Vote for me, I'll give you a tax cut and a free AR-15 or whatever. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=982.0s)]
*  She's basically making that pitch. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=987.0s)]
*  She's running as some kind of right winger. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=990.0s)]
*  Have you noticed this? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=992.0s)]
*  Yeah, the defund the police chick is somehow now a conservative. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=994.0s)]
*  Right, okay, got it. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=997.0s)]
*  I don't even need to know her history. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=999.0s)]
*  I don't need to know anything about her. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1001.0s)]
*  I listen to her talk and I think, you're lying. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1003.0s)]
*  You're lying. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1006.0s)]
*  And this is before I even know that she was, you know, Montel Williams side piece or whatever. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1007.0s)]
*  I know nothing about her. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1012.0s)]
*  That's just verification of what I already felt. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1016.0s)]
*  I knew that without even calling Montel and asking him. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1021.0s)]
*  I knew who you were. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1026.0s)]
*  And we all do. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1029.0s)]
*  So I would say hone your spidey senses these next six weeks because you're going to be lied to at a volume with a level of aggression you've never seen before. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1032.0s)]
*  And the command will always be the same. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1042.0s)]
*  Ignore what's right in front of your face. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1044.0s)]
*  You didn't see that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1046.0s)]
*  That's not real. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1047.0s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1048.0s)]
*  That's really the message. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1050.0s)]
*  You're crazy. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1051.0s)]
*  You can only trust us. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1052.0s)]
*  The rest is disinformation. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1053.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1056.0s)]
*  First of all, anyone who uses the phrase disinformation is a liar. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1057.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1064.0s)]
*  We're done. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1066.0s)]
*  Disinformation is not a category. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1068.0s)]
*  There's only one category. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1071.0s)]
*  Truth or falsehood. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1073.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1074.0s)]
*  Disinformation is another way of saying you're saying something that's inconvenient to me. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1077.0s)]
*  You are criticizing me. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1083.0s)]
*  I don't like what you're saying. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1085.0s)]
*  Shut up or go to jail. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1087.0s)]
*  That's not a valid category. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1088.0s)]
*  That's totalitarianism. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1090.0s)]
*  That's tyranny. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1092.0s)]
*  So anyone who uses the word disinformation is immediately on the liar's side. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1093.0s)]
*  Don't listen to another word. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1099.0s)]
*  That person is your enemy. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1101.0s)]
*  Listen only to people who care about the only thing that is worth caring about, which is is it true or not? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1102.0s)]
*  Is it actually true? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1112.0s)]
*  And the people who care about whether it's true are your guides through a dark time, and they're your only guides. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1114.0s)]
*  And they're not many of them. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1121.0s)]
*  And I just want to say I'm so grateful that we have two of them tonight. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1122.0s)]
*  I'm going to introduce them in order. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1125.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1127.0s)]
*  Consider doing this. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1128.0s)]
*  Imagine going to your computer, looking at your entire browsing history on the web, everything you've looked at. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1129.0s)]
*  Now imagine hitting print and then signing your full name at the bottom, maybe with your Social Security number, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1136.0s)]
*  printing out that browsing history with your name on it and nailing it to the front door of, say, your house for everybody in the world to see. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1141.0s)]
*  Maybe that would be fine. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1149.0s)]
*  Maybe not. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1151.0s)]
*  And while you're at it, actually, take a copy of that same list of everything you've looked at on the Internet and post it in the break room at work. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1152.0s)]
*  And then, in fact, go farther than that. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1158.0s)]
*  Blow that up and put it on a billboard over a major highway on your commute to work. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1160.0s)]
*  Here's everything I've been looking at on the Internet. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1165.0s)]
*  Would you want to do that? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1167.0s)]
*  You don't have to be a creep to think maybe that's not something I'd want to do. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1169.0s)]
*  But in effect, that's what you're already doing every single day unless you already use the sponsor of this video, ExpressVPN. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1173.0s)]
*  You are allowing all of your online activity to become public. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1181.0s)]
*  Why? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1186.0s)]
*  Because Internet service providers can see every website you have ever visited. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1187.0s)]
*  Yes, even if you're in incognito or private browsing mode, that doesn't really work. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1192.0s)]
*  And in the United States, your Internet service provider can then sell your data to whomever they please, including the government. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1198.0s)]
*  And they do, by the way. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1204.0s)]
*  So what can you do about that? [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1206.0s)]
*  Well, you can do what people in our office do, particularly when we're abroad, but also when we're here. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1208.0s)]
*  And that's encrypt your online activity before it even reaches the Internet service provider so no one can see it. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1214.0s)]
*  It's private. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1219.0s)]
*  Privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1220.0s)]
*  So keep it close. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1222.0s)]
*  We use ExpressVPN to do that. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1224.0s)]
*  That's our Internet provider. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1225.0s)]
*  Our Internet provider cannot see what we're doing on the Internet because we use ExpressVPN. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1228.0s)]
*  They can't record it. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1234.0s)]
*  They can't share it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1235.0s)]
*  They can't sell our browsing history because they never have it to begin with. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1236.0s)]
*  Why don't they have it to begin with? [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1239.0s)]
*  Because ExpressVPN reroutes our online activity through secure servers and changes our IP address and makes you more anonymous to apps and websites trying to track us. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1240.0s)]
*  It'll do the same for you. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1250.0s)]
*  What we like about it is it's so easy to use, even if you're not a tech genius. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1251.0s)]
*  You tap one button on whatever device you're using, whether it's your phone, your laptop, your tablet, your desktop, and you know that your privacy is secure. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1257.0s)]
*  Once again, privacy is a prerequisite for freedom. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1265.0s)]
*  You can't be free unless you have privacy. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1269.0s)]
*  And if you want to start reclaiming your privacy, do yourself a favor and use our special link to get three months of ExpressVPN for free. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1271.0s)]
*  Just go to ExpressVPN slash Tucker. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1278.0s)]
*  That's Express E X P R E S S VPN dot com slash Tucker. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1281.0s)]
*  So the first who's going to join me in just a second is my friend Larry Elder, who I've known for a really long time. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1288.0s)]
*  He's a wonderful man. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1295.0s)]
*  He's a wonderful man. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1297.0s)]
*  And of the many things that we have in common, Larry Elder and I are both from Southern California, which used to be the kind of thing that you know you bragged about. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1301.0s)]
*  Now I tell everyone I'm from Sheboygan. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1311.0s)]
*  No one believes me, but I tell them that actually walk a shot. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1313.0s)]
*  But whatever. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1317.0s)]
*  But it used to be I'm 55 when I was a kid. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1320.0s)]
*  We felt very sorry for anybody who was not from Southern California. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1323.0s)]
*  You wouldn't say it right to their face because you don't want to be mean. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1326.0s)]
*  But we just thought they were deeply, deeply unfortunate. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1329.0s)]
*  They just didn't know they couldn't afford the bus fare or whatever. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1331.0s)]
*  But if you didn't live in Southern California, we were sad for you because it was such a wonderful place. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1334.0s)]
*  It was the greatest place. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1339.0s)]
*  It was the apogee of human civilization. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1340.0s)]
*  And I still think that. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1343.0s)]
*  And it matters what's happened to California. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1345.0s)]
*  And I find myself since I live as far from California as you can possibly live in the state of Maine now. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1347.0s)]
*  You know, it's like a distant fact to me. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1352.0s)]
*  It's like a typhoon in Bangladesh. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1355.0s)]
*  Like I feel sad, but it doesn't really affect me. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1358.0s)]
*  But it actually does affect me. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1361.0s)]
*  It's our largest state, actually. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1363.0s)]
*  And it is a bellwether. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1365.0s)]
*  What happens in California does tend to move east inexorably. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1367.0s)]
*  And so we have to care. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1372.0s)]
*  And what is happening in California? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1374.0s)]
*  Well, I can promise you the entire American news media colludes to hide the truth of what's happening in California from you. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1376.0s)]
*  Because they don't want you to know what they want to do to you is the truth. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1385.0s)]
*  And Larry Elder knows he cares enough to have run for the governorship of California. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1390.0s)]
*  He's probably the last sensible person who ever will. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1396.0s)]
*  It's a one party state. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1399.0s)]
*  But he made an honorable and good faith effort to dislodge Gavin Newsom. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1401.0s)]
*  Some of us were really rooting for him. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1406.0s)]
*  I had him on for his announcement one Thursday night. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1409.0s)]
*  And the next night was my last show because I got fired. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1412.0s)]
*  So I wasn't able to cheer him on for my perch at a TV channel. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1414.0s)]
*  But I was certainly from the sidelines. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1418.0s)]
*  So Larry Elder is going to come out in about 30 seconds and tell us what the state is actually like. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1420.0s)]
*  Because you should know even if you live here in the beautiful, unchanged Midwest. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1426.0s)]
*  And the second person we're going to talk to is Robert F. Kennedy Jr. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1430.0s)]
*  And the one thing I would say about Bobby who I've been friendly with and really admired for a long time. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1434.0s)]
*  Before it was even cool, I had some secret opinions about Pharma that I didn't want to share in public since they were our biggest advertiser. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1440.0s)]
*  But I have for many years thought he was on the scent. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1448.0s)]
*  Like one of my dogs hunting down a pheasant in a cornrow. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1454.0s)]
*  I was like, yeah, you're getting warmer there, Bobby. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1458.0s)]
*  But Bobby's life is amazing. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1461.0s)]
*  I could go on for hours. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1464.0s)]
*  I'll do it in one sentence. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1465.0s)]
*  What's happened to Bobby Kennedy over the last 18 months gives me hope for this country. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1466.0s)]
*  Because there's no one, you know, there's no one who's going to be able to do it. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1472.0s)]
*  And I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1476.0s)]
*  And I'm going to be able to do it. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1478.0s)]
*  You see that's great, right? [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1480.0s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1481.0s)]
*  Did their [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1483.0s)]
*  Havoc, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1497.5s)]
*  and pretends that he's on your side as he's lying right to your face to send [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1506.36s)]
*  your children to go die in some pointless foreign war and Bobby Kennedy [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1509.4799999999998s)]
*  is actually trying to save your children from dying young from preventable [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1513.24s)]
*  disease and if you're like me you've never voted for a Democrat in your life [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1517.76s)]
*  and you never are going to but you ask yourself like wait a second maybe this [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1521.8799999999999s)]
*  is all fake actually and it is the real divide is not between Republicans and [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1526.4799999999998s)]
*  Democrats the real divide is between the liars and people brave enough to tell [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1535.28s)]
*  the truth and Bobby Kennedy's in the latter category as you're about to find [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1540.32s)]
*  out so with that I am honored to introduce for an update on the biggest [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1548.2s)]
*  most important state the Golden State of California my friend Larry Elder [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1554.2s)]
*  Larry Elder I'm so honored you're here are you aware that Tucker does not wear [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1565.28s)]
*  socks I don't wear socks no I don't you get to a certain age and you're like you [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1574.6399999999999s)]
*  know I still pay my taxes and get a driver's license but there's some [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1580.8799999999999s)]
*  things I'm not doing I don't want to know what else you don't wear I'm gonna [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1583.56s)]
*  commando unit let me just say that excuse I beg your pardon [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1591.48s)]
*  doesn't take much for me to get right to the vulgar newsroom and deep inside me [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1596.68s)]
*  um so Larry you as I said I got fired right after you announced I was sitting [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1601.4s)]
*  I killed your show I came on this show on Thursday and I announced I was running [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1609.56s)]
*  for president and by the way this is a kind of the scene of the crime for me [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1614.88s)]
*  you had the first GOP debate here in Milwaukee and I was required to get three [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1620.44s)]
*  polls where I said 1% are better to qualify so I turned in three polls where [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1627.08s)]
*  I had 1% or better I get a phone call from Ronnie McDaniel and she said one [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1631.56s)]
*  of the polls you can't use I said which one she said Rasmussen I said why she [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1635.44s)]
*  said because it's affiliated with the Trump campaign and it is true that the [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1640.64s)]
*  rules are if anybody commissions a poll that person can't use it nor can any [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1644.0s)]
*  other candidate use it so after the announcement was made that elder didn't [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1648.84s)]
*  qualify Rasmussen puts out a tweet and says we're not affiliated with Trump [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1652.52s)]
*  there's no reason why elder can't use me so I submitted a fourth one and she said [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1656.48s)]
*  you submitted it too late so my lawyer is the former chair of the Federal [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1659.8s)]
*  Election Commission Tucker and he told me that by failing to apply the debate [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1665.1599999999999s)]
*  criteria fairly to elder what the RNC did essentially was to give an in-kind [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1668.9599999999998s)]
*  contribution to the eight candidates who did make it on the debate stage and [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1674.48s)]
*  based on the value of the time at Fox News that's a hundred million dollars so [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1678.44s)]
*  I told them I flew here to Milwaukee anyway on the eve of the debate I said [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1682.8s)]
*  if you don't put me up there by two o'clock I'm going to file a complaint [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1686.72s)]
*  with the FEC for a hundred million dollars and tick tick tick I thought [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1690.56s)]
*  they were gonna blink they did not so they didn't put me on as you know and I [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1694.7s)]
*  have filed that complaint so we'll find out what happens. So I guess my takeaway [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1697.92s)]
*  would be are you saying the RNC is not totally on the level? Shockingly I think [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1701.6s)]
*  their goal Tucker was to reduce the number of candidates they felt that 17 [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1709.3999999999999s)]
*  was too many in 2016 they wanted to reduce it to a more manageable number I [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1713.6399999999999s)]
*  guess I don't really know and Tucker I wasn't trying to displace Donald Trump I [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1717.32s)]
*  knew he was going to be the nominee but there are some issues I thought were not [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1723.32s)]
*  talked about and I felt if I could get those issues front and center I do my [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=1726.52s)]

*  five years later and all the other assassinations that we saw during the [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3201.96s)]
*  1960s so I just wanted to complete that thought but that was I mean that was [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3206.7200000000003s)]
*  over 60 years ago and that institution you know those files are still classified [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3211.04s)]
*  as you well know better than most and those institutions remain intact and [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3214.8s)]
*  except for one series of hearings in 1975 there's been no meaningful effort [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3219.2s)]
*  and you sort of wonder like at what point do we learn the truth about [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3225.32s)]
*  everything federal agencies have done with our money in our name and at what [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3229.92s)]
*  point are they reformed I mean I think it's really you know we pad there's an [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3233.48s)]
*  act called the JFK assassination papers act it requires all those documents be [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3240.84s)]
*  released the American public by 2018 all the documents pertaining to my uncle's [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3246.84s)]
*  death and President Trump when he ran the first time in 2016 promised to [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3251.28s)]
*  release them and then he didn't which always struck me as odd and then [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3257.52s)]
*  President Biden ran promising to release him and he didn't I had the [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3263.2400000000002s)]
*  opportunity recently as President Trump directly why he did not release them and [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3267.1800000000003s)]
*  he said that Mike Pompeo called him and said please do not let me relate make me [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3273.4s)]
*  the release these it is gonna be a calamity for our country but President [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3282.44s)]
*  Trump says if he at this time if he's going to release them and I believe [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3289.64s)]
*  that he will [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3294.44s)]
*  so can I say why would why would Mike Pompeo who I don't think was even born [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3297.8s)]
*  or had just been born when your uncle was murdered why would he have an [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3304.08s)]
*  interest in keeping those documents secret well clearly it's not to protect [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3308.2799999999997s)]
*  any individual because the virtually all the individuals who were directly [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3312.72s)]
*  involved in my uncle's death and many are now dead and many of those have you [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3318.7599999999998s)]
*  know gave deathbed confessions or gave confessions of various kinds before [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3324.4s)]
*  they died but it must the only I think the only supposition that is rational is [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3329.04s)]
*  that it's about protecting an institution and I think you know in the [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3337.28s)]
*  last tranche of documents that were released and that New York Times even [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3342.0s)]
*  reported this that which had and the Times has been one of the major [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3348.92s)]
*  bulwarks against conspiracy theories that you know that depart from the [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3353.0s)]
*  single-shooter Lee Harvey Oswald killed John Kennedy they've been the big [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3358.0s)]
*  bulwark against that so it's extraordinary that they finally [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3363.68s)]
*  reported that Lee Harvey Oswald was a CIA asset and that the CIA made went to [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3367.44s)]
*  great lengths to conceal that not only for the Warren Commission and as most [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3373.86s)]
*  of you probably know Alan Dulles who was the head of the CIA who my uncle fired [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3379.04s)]
*  after the Bay of Pigs and then come back into public life to get himself [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3385.88s)]
*  appointed to the Warren Commission and he was really the only commissioner that [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3391.92s)]
*  was there for every meeting he was the only one that was paying attention all [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3398.2000000000003s)]
*  of the other ones like Chief Justice Warren was the Chief Justice Supreme [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3403.2000000000003s)]
*  Court he had a full-time job the other ones were congressmen and senators other [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3407.16s)]
*  well-known individuals were fully occupied by their work the only one for [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3412.44s)]
*  whom it was a full-time job was Alan Dulles and his function was to make sure [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3418.16s)]
*  that any questions about the CIA involvement were quashed and he concealed [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3423.56s)]
*  the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald had been recruited into the agency in 1957 and [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3430.96s)]
*  1958 and sent on a mission to Russia which was a false defection mission and [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3436.24s)]
*  then brought back to this country and so the first time you know many of us who [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3442.3199999999997s)]
*  been studying the assassination knew this but has never been reported in the [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3447.24s)]
*  mainstream press and and after that last tranche of documents was released five [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3452.16s)]
*  years ago the New York Times finally acknowledged that and there may be [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3457.9599999999996s)]
*  other information related to that that they don't want released but I have no [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3462.04s)]
*  idea what it is. So what does it take I mean you can't have a democracy in a [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3468.24s)]
*  system where the public has no idea what its government is doing and that's what [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3472.16s)]
*  we have now so how do you fix that what would it take to actually bring [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3475.32s)]
*  transparency to the federal agencies? Yeah I mean let me answer that in a second but [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3479.48s)]
*  to follow up on your what you know why this is important for democracy my when [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3486.0800000000004s)]

*  the first time and you know we didn't you know they would there'd been there'd [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3509.52s)]
*  been this this tremendous resistance to starting the CIA in this country the OSS [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3514.2s)]

*  World War two but Congress both Republicans and Democrats were very very [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3525.7999999999997s)]
*  reluctant to do it because they said secret police agencies are associated [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3529.92s)]
*  with totalitarian states the Gestapo, the Stasi, SAVAK in Iran, PEEP in [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3536.3199999999997s)]

*  consistent they're antithetical to democracies you can't have them they're [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3552.52s)]
*  inconsistent with a democracy so they've been very reluctant to do it and then in [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3556.36s)]
*  1948 and so they disbanded the OSS after World War two and then Truman became [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3561.16s)]
*  convinced that we had one weapon really which was the atomic bomb and he didn't [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3567.64s)]

*  things to do espionage which is intelligence gathering in 1948 and [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=3585.3599999999997s)]

*  Milgram concluded was that a figure of authority can persuade people the [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4190.0s)]
*  average person 67% of people to override their most closely and [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4200.4s)]

*  involved in a giant Milgram experiment where we had a medical doctor [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4220.0s)]
*  which doctor to be more specific well we had dr. Fauci we all know and who was [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4228.04s)]

*  weeks later everybody put him on everybody put two of them on and he [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4250.92s)]

*  infectious respiratory illness you do not need a vaccination and yet he changed [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4263.88s)]
*  his mind and he said the best vaccine you can have is to have to have the [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4269.24s)]
*  disease there's nothing better you'll never beat it then he said even if you've [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4273.64s)]
*  had it you need to get the shot so they were telling us things that they knew [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4279.4s)]
*  were wrong but we we were doing it because it was an authority telling us [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4284.0s)]
*  and then and it also there's another phenomena that anybody who disagrees [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4288.24s)]
*  with that authority becomes the enemy they become dangerous they have to be [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4293.759999999999s)]
*  silenced now the good news is that 33% of the people in the Milgram experiment [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4299.839999999999s)]
*  got up and walked out [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4308.24s)]

*  so and you know that sounds like hyperbole but think about it they they [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4429.72s)]
*  figured out you know the most important right is freedom of speech and Hamilton [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4434.8s)]
*  Madison and Adam said we put that in the First Amendment freedom of expression [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG28ZnNQh6I&t=4440.76s)]
