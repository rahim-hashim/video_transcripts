*  I [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=30.0s)]
*  Somebody told me yesterday that you're you lead the field among stand-ups for death threats [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=49.68s)]
*  Yeah, I was the first one to get him why [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=54.82s)]
*  I had this when I was yeah, I don't know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=60.92s)]
*  What do you mean? You don't know? I mean, I don't know exactly. So I had this when I was starting in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=64.76s)]
*  National and Poonz was doing this like fake [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=70.4s)]
*  fake [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=73.0s)]
*  reality show [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=74.52s)]
*  pitches it was like a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=75.9s)]
*  The idea was they went up it was all faked [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=77.36s)]
*  But they all found a box of pitches for a reality show up and like the offices of NBC or something [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=79.56s)]
*  But the craziest pitch is possible one was like I can throw up on command [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=85.1s)]
*  Another was like I watched that. Yeah. Yeah, there's a guy who drank apricot and just like barfed everywhere and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=89.36s)]
*  Mine was called the amazing racist [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=95.04s)]
*  Off the amazing race and was just like a super overboard [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=98.16s)]
*  Right. They came to me the idea and I was like, that's funny, but let's like really go for it if we're gonna go for it [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=101.48s)]
*  No, but that was a thing. I've seen that. Oh you have the you're amazing racist. Yeah going to the black convenience store in a clan outfit [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=106.4s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=112.48s)]
*  So either you get it or you don't if you're mad I can see why you get mad but also like why I [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Mean that's over the top that of course your joke if I'm throwing oranges wait at a Mexican yelling go back to Africa [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=119.56s)]
*  That you can't see maybe or like wait, but you're Jewish like right [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=127.8s)]
*  So if I'm wearing a clown outfit and I'm a comedian as a Jew wearing a clan outfit [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=131.88s)]
*  Probably not in the clan probably not the clad you see it's ridiculous [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=137.68s)]
*  Anyway, so my buddy Duncan Trussell who's a great comic and hilarious and weird he [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=140.8s)]
*  Early websites. He built a website saying if you prank my friend Ari Shafir [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=146.4s)]
*  Send him a prank call [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=151.44s)]
*  Record it. I'll give you 20 bucks for the best one [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=153.44s)]
*  This is before all that stuff came out [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=155.76000000000002s)]
*  So the national impetus DVD came out and then somebody ripped it to the internet [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  So pretty early YouTube was like this without context of national impoons just me going. Hi, I'm Ari Shafir [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=159.96s)]
*  I'm the amazing racist. Let me do this horrible thing right now [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=165.92000000000002s)]
*  Anyway, so people like saw it googled my name [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=168.56s)]
*  The first thing that came up was Duncan before you even click on the you know, the Google search [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=170.48s)]
*  It says Ari Shafir phone number [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=174.56s)]
*  So that was it your actual phone? Yeah. Yeah, so the but it was pre-doc saying it was before any of that [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=177.04s)]
*  You know before America got dangerous. Yeah, so I would just start getting phone calls. It was great [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=182.56s)]
*  Like what I'll fucking kill you you think you're so funny [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=188.32s)]
*  One of them was I picked up a bunch of Latinos Mexicans [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  One of them was I picked up a bunch of Latinos Mexicans say I want you to fix my deck and then drove them to the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=195.2s)]
*  INS building [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=201.04s)]
*  It started yelling la migra and they ran out whatever whatever it was funny [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  Nobody was hurt in the making of it [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  But people took it seriously people took it seriously with my favorite one was I'll build a deck in your ass homes [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=209.28s)]
*  I would just get calls all the time. I had to put my ringer on mute. Do you think I mean [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=216.56s)]
*  They weren't serious though. None of them were real [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=220.64s)]
*  So when now when people go I would been threatened i'm like shut up, this isn't a real thing [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=223.28s)]
*  I've been getting it for 20 years. But do you think anybody was actually offended? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  It's instructive because I got I would get a few like messages facebook back then or myspace even and it was like [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=233.52s)]
*  Fuck you. You're a piece of shit. I'm mexican. How dare you and then I like right back like, you know [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=240.0s)]
*  It's just a joke. I actually paid all those guys 50 bucks took them back to where they work in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=244.88000000000002s)]
*  Um, like nothing actually happened [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  Um [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=251.6s)]
*  And I drove them to a library wasn't even like, you know, it just looked like the ins building [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=252.79999999999998s)]
*  um [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=257.92s)]
*  And then they would respond like, oh, okay. I actually did think it was funny [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=259.36s)]
*  I laughed when I saw it. I'm like, so we went from laughing exactly. He's threatening me because you're supposed to [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=262.56s)]
*  And that is what it is. Yeah, right people feel this like moral obligation to be mad about certain [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, but your real reaction is you were laughing [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=272.96s)]
*  So do you ever get people walking out of your shows? Yeah all the time [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=275.84s)]
*  All the time, why do you think they do that number of reasons too dirty is the main. Yeah, I don't want to hear about sex [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, so that's that's an okay one. Yeah, it used to be the dirty comics were like it's cheap [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=284.96s)]
*  You're dirty. Oh you talk about blowjobs and it was like, okay fine [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=290.0s)]
*  And so then the clean comics were like i'm a well-written comedian. I could do, you know, whatever [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=293.44s)]
*  um [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=297.68s)]
*  And they would just look down on us, but it wasn't a moral thing right now [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=299.68s)]
*  It's a moral thing they put them on a moral high ground [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=303.2s)]
*  They put these people on moral low ground. So like you're kind of evil for doing it not just like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=306.16s)]
*  Cheap or easy you're you're wrong. You are wrong. You're immoral. Yeah, and it's like but it's the same thing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=311.20000000000005s)]

*  I had to hear something. I didn't like to hear but in a functioning society [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=362.64s)]
*  Like you have a man at home to calm you down. Maybe that's part of the problem [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=365.12s)]
*  Well, you yeah you so you see it at the shows the man that's with them. Sometimes it's either like [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=368.24s)]

*  I mean you're allowed to say more things or there are fewer [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=491.92s)]
*  umpires or they're just we're allowed to say more things or [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=495.76s)]
*  People let us say more things everybody's allowed to say. Yeah, right [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=498.88s)]
*  Yes [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=501.12s)]
*  It felt like there for a while. There are only like four things you were allowed to say [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=502.4s)]
*  And now I hear people just giving opinions. So jen z is way better than millennials [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=506.16s)]
*  Why jen z? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=511.12s)]

*  So I was a skier [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=523.2s)]
*  In what late 80s snowboard started mid 80s. Yeah. Yeah [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=524.88s)]
*  And [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  Everyone's like i'm not skiing. That's my fucking dad. I'm a snowboarder. It's cool [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=529.1999999999999s)]
*  And then a generation passed and now the kids like i'm not snowboarding. That's my father [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=533.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so they go the opposite way. I just I stayed true to skiing and never changed. Yeah [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=538.4799999999999s)]
*  You still ski? Yeah. Yeah, all mountains should be no snowboard mountains. I completely agree [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=543.3599999999999s)]

*  And i'm like trying to do it and then I was just down [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=581.7600000000001s)]
*  That hurts [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=584.32s)]
*  Yeah, your bindings don't release when you fall off a ski lift. Yeah [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=586.0s)]
*  It was on the floor though. And so I was probably put my head up some old man [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=589.12s)]
*  Just shoved my head back down because it was kind of chopping it off [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=592.1600000000001s)]
*  So you think people in their 20s are better than people in their 30s? Yeah [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  So anyway, these people the gen zers looked at the millennials their ants and their fucking whatever and they're like you guys are angry [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=598.08s)]
*  And we don't want to be like you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=605.6s)]
*  And they understand at least for stand-up comedy like we know they're not serious you guys didn't know they weren't serious [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=607.2s)]
*  We know they're not serious [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=612.72s)]
*  so when they say [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=614.4000000000001s)]
*  I don't know. Let's bring slavery about let's give it another chance. We know you're you're being ridiculous. We know it's jonathan swift. It's it's it's fine [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=616.8000000000001s)]
*  So then they're like well now we can laugh. You don't mean that are you ever offended by anything? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=624.24s)]

*  Have you ever heard a joke where you're like, ah, i'm not into it. Yeah, there's certain times [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  If like if I just heard my dad speak about the holocaust and I hear a holocaust joke i'm like just not in the mood [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, um, but there are other times you're you're but also i'll just quietly [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=649.92s)]
*  leave [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=654.4s)]
*  Or if it's like political jokes, i'm like, I don't I don't get the references here. Right. I just don't follow it [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=656.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I noticed that at breakfast this morning you're not covering falling politics like is that a good guy? [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=661.9200000000001s)]
*  But how are you going to deal with I mean? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=666.1600000000001s)]
*  There are some political stories are sort of unavoidable [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=668.5600000000001s)]
*  Like the current one with biden like how are you like what do you make of that? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=671.52s)]
*  Like the like his physical condition his mental condition. I just hear people talking. Oh you haven't seen any of it [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=675.84s)]
*  a little like from from people referencing on stand-up comedy clips [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=682.32s)]
*  Like shane had one where he's like talking about how he left the stage real slow and he was talking about like i've done that drunk [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=687.12s)]

*  Really if it's on i'll avoid i'll leave the room. Why it's hatred [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  It's it's terrible. It's put you in a terrible mental state for for some of you don't affect you [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=707.6s)]
*  Everyone thinks they're making a difference. They're not [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=712.4s)]
*  I mean you had a popular show on on like a major network [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=715.76s)]
*  Yeah, you also didn't make a difference [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=719.76s)]
*  Rogan doesn't make well, I got fired. Yeah, but like this idea like i'm gonna change everything [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=722.08s)]
*  Yeah, the high level guys who had to reach who had to reach maybe you could because you reach a lot of people [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=727.12s)]
*  I did but like I agree with you you being upset about biden or trump. It's like what is it doing? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=732.0s)]
*  It's gonna happen regardless. It's like being upset about the rain [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=737.76s)]
*  You really think so? So it sounds like you don't buy the premise of democracy [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=741.12s)]
*  Listen [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=745.9200000000001s)]

*  Yeah, so like they I always loved how they felt about our government's crooked. We can't do anything [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=761.04s)]
*  Let's get drunk and do the worst coke in the world [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=767.04s)]
*  and that's what they [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=769.76s)]

*  Well, it wasn't caused by smoking. Yeah [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=816.48s)]
*  It's caused by the ozone [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=819.12s)]
*  so [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't pay a day. It's gonna happen regardless why why? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=823.04s)]
*  lose sleep over but what about the idea that [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  Um [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=829.7600000000001s)]
*  If you don't do anything about it, then it just gets worse and worse and worse if society doesn't do anything about it [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=830.96s)]
*  It gets worse and worse if I don't do anything about it. It's not going to change your moral obligation to vote [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=835.36s)]
*  If you don't vote you're not allowed to complain can I tell you something that no one seems to get on my side on [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=842.0s)]
*  If you think the system is corrupt. Yeah [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=848.08s)]
*  Participation in the system is you? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=851.74s)]
*  cosigning the system [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=854.3800000000001s)]
*  So it's like it doesn't matter which side you're voting on this corrupt they both lie to you two party only possibilities [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=856.48s)]
*  Which is what they're revolting in in hong kong. Yeah. Yeah, here's your two possible choices only [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  Just saying okay. Well, i'll take this one is you saying yeah this system. I agree with it and I don't agree with the system [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=866.96s)]
*  Well, I at all i'm sympathetic to what you're saying [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=872.96s)]
*  i'm actually not dismissing you out of hand because I think you're making a pretty solid point the the problem though is [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=874.88s)]
*  It could get to a point where they show up at your house and start hassling you directly who? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=880.64s)]
*  The government to vote [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=885.44s)]
*  No, no, no to I mean the government gets in the wrong hands like it can be pretty [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=887.44s)]
*  intrusive [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=891.9s)]
*  I guess [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=893.2s)]
*  So yeah, but like here's two problems with that one. It's a worst-case scenario way of living right? [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=894.72s)]
*  Um, I mean i've heard the holocaust is coming back my entire life. This can lead to the holocaust [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=901.36s)]
*  George bush it could be hitler trump was hitler trump was definitely hitler everybody's hitler [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=907.84s)]
*  And i'm like, I don't where where is this happening? [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=913.8399999999999s)]
*  Um, so it's like you hear these worst-case scenarios all the time [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=916.8s)]
*  They don't come to fruition and also it's like you still won't have any effect on it when they were talking about going to war with iran [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=919.68s)]
*  They're like, this is a nuclear holocaust and everyone was bitching about it [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=924.48s)]
*  And I was skiing [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=928.0799999999999s)]
*  And i'm like you guys can lose your last days if there's a nuclear holocaust coming these are your last days [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=930.0s)]
*  And I spent it skiing and you spent arguing online with a stranger [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=935.1999999999999s)]
*  I like who's god gonna say did it right? You know, that's that's that's actually completely [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=939.1999999999999s)]
*  Like you're not actually affecting it [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=946.4s)]
*  And if enough people there's a whole book in the jewish bible called ecclesiastes. It basically makes this point really. Yeah, interesting you should [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=948.56s)]

*  I think I do think that the sabbath laws are [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1573.14s)]
*  You know like if you're using somebody else to do something that you're not allowed to do [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1576.82s)]
*  Yeah, well I talk about the loopholes in that special where it's like you're actually not allowed to fully ask them [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1580.82s)]
*  Can you turn this light on because then that's like you're doing it? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1584.74s)]

*  It's so loophole it's great [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1604.58s)]
*  But what was the moment where you decided so you can't use electricity I was in a dorm room in a in a [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1607.78s)]
*  Shiva that's closed now in in bai vigan jerusalem [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1614.26s)]
*  And there was a light a reading light above my bed and you could use that to like read talmud before you go to sleep [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1617.06s)]
*  Or whatever left it on and shavas [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1622.5s)]
*  and what I was going to do was take a [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1625.3s)]
*  Hand washing cup. There's like a ritual hand washing to do in the mornings and or bread [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1628.1s)]
*  Um, and I was going to put that [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1632.98s)]
*  Over the light it was like this little ball and I was going to put it over like drown the light [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1635.14s)]
*  So with light still on it just drowned out the cup kept falling [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1640.1s)]
*  Kept putting it on there kept because it's round the bay. It just kept falling off [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1644.1s)]
*  It wouldn't stay on and the light was in my eye and it was frustrating. You want to sleep? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1648.18s)]
*  You can't and at some point I was like i'm just going to turn it off [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1652.26s)]
*  It's friday night. I'm not allowed but then my so the the entrance to the yeshiva was like right here [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1656.5s)]
*  My window is right here. So anyone coming in or out would see my light go off [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1661.94s)]
*  and they'd be like [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1666.42s)]
*  We're all these super orthodox jews. No light can go on or off. We'll we'll notice that on a friday night [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1667.86s)]
*  And I was like fuck i'll get caught i'll get in trouble if I do this [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1673.46s)]
*  So I didn't do it [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1677.86s)]
*  I didn't even do it didn't break any law [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1679.22s)]
*  But I thought about it for like a couple years the fact that I was more worried about a man getting me in trouble than god [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1682.26s)]
*  When it's god's law, it's not man's law [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1690.18s)]
*  um [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1692.9s)]
*  Jaywalking sure i'll make look for a cop right do that, you know, but but the sabbath stuff [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1694.26s)]
*  That's all just god. I shouldn't give a fuck about jews [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1698.66s)]
*  Seeing me. Um, there's I've in the Torah. There's like a worse punishment for someone who steals in secrecy than it steals brazenly [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1701.62s)]
*  Because at least stealing brazenly exactly you're not worried about man catching exactly and you're like well fuck god either way [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1709.32s)]
*  But but I don't give a shit about man [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1714.68s)]
*  So the fact that I was more worried about people getting me in trouble than god and I was talking about I was like [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1717.16s)]
*  I don't think I believe in him or I wouldn't have done it if I believed there was this like [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1721.48s)]
*  You know old man in heaven saying don't do this [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1726.6s)]
*  It'll be bad for your mortal soul. I just wouldn't do it [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1729.16s)]
*  Uh compared to like if your dad's in the room [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1733.08s)]
*  You don't masturbate [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1736.04s)]
*  Right because you believe he's real of course and his reaction is pretty obvious what it would be [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1737.56s)]
*  but [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1742.28s)]

*  And I was like [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1752.6s)]
*  I think i'm out [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1753.72s)]
*  Maybe the lesson is you care too much for other people think [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1756.04s)]
*  No, I mean that's another way to look at it. Yeah. Yeah. So anyways, my friends got met [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=1760.12s)]

*  And then he like crumpled up a turn and I but we all knew the order so the crowd didn't know and I'd smell like [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2498.4599999999996s)]
*  That's like, um, that's like it's got a nutty aroma [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2503.66s)]

*  I asked people what questions do you have and sometimes like what's with the wigs? I'm like, oh, okay [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2529.7400000000002s)]
*  Well, it's a loophole. You can't be attracted to your neighbor's wife [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2534.46s)]
*  So hair is something you're attracted to [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2538.94s)]
*  So you cover up your hair [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2541.26s)]
*  So it's not your hair. It's some fucking asian lady's hair [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2543.26s)]
*  You know, which is actually better hair [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2546.7799999999997s)]

*  Um, and you just do stuff like what are the what are the pillows? I'm like what pillows what do you mean? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2551.66s)]
*  Oh, it's your fucking bag that you have for your for your [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2555.8199999999997s)]
*  Tallis or fill in [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2558.7s)]
*  That you carry it looks like a pillow to them [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2560.22s)]
*  I never it's just as it was a way of looking at stuff like and so the same questions would come up [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2561.98s)]
*  Over and over again and i'd riff try to be funny and i'm like if the same question keeps coming up [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2567.02s)]
*  I [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2571.9s)]
*  This is something I should cover and if a question came up once ever then i'm like, all right, that's just one guy [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2573.1s)]
*  One of us like why are jews afraid of cats? I'm like that's just one jew you knew bro. That's not a stereotype [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2579.18s)]
*  That was just one jew [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2583.74s)]
*  Um, and so I would just try to cover everything [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2585.34s)]
*  That's not a thing 100% is not a thing [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2589.26s)]
*  um [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2592.06s)]
*  So yeah, I would just try to and then I would try to tweak it and tweak it and tweak it and then I'd have [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2593.34s)]
*  To do this thing where it's like I had to see if I was wrong [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2596.62s)]
*  Which I don't ever do in my stand-up [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2599.66s)]
*  But it had to be correct. I couldn't be wrong about the religion. Yeah [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2602.06s)]
*  Yeah, yeah [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2606.22s)]
*  So like I started doing a bit about that fucking through a hole in a sheet and then my friend was like that's not a true thing [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2607.18s)]
*  I'm like fuck [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2612.38s)]
*  I had other rabbis had this giant bit a closer about noah [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2613.82s)]
*  And his and his his 40 he had 40 children and how his wife was the real hero because her pussy must have been blown [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2618.94s)]
*  Out and then a rabbi in copenhagen was like, hey loved it the whole thing. He didn't have 40 kids [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2624.38s)]
*  And I was like no he did he go [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2630.54s)]
*  No [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2632.78s)]
*  He had two two sons. I forget now two sons and three daughters, whatever. Yeah, yeah, and their husbands [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2633.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and it was like it just wasn't 40. I was like no [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2638.94s)]
*  He goes he goes I don't mind. I don't care. I'm just telling I love the whole thing [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2641.9s)]
*  I'm just telling you that wasn't that's not right and I had to lose it [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2644.94s)]
*  I had to lose a fucking five-minute like crushing chunk because it wasn't correct [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2648.0600000000004s)]
*  Any other bit I was doing I could just like fuck it. I made up a detail [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2652.54s)]
*  But why were you fact checking your own stuff? It had to be because I was doing a thing about a religion [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2656.06s)]
*  It was doing a factual informational hour, which I've never done. Did you have any complaints? Yeah [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2661.6600000000003s)]

*  It's it's respectful. So who is saying that it was a love letter to my religion. It sounds like it actually [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2683.6600000000003s)]
*  In in my artistic way in the the comedy way, but people can't don't you think people can smell the intent behind? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2689.5s)]
*  Well, that's what it was. So it was like a couple outliers were like, let's look for something angry in the world [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2695.6600000000003s)]

*  It seeps through if you're on instagram and just like you see people weighing in on stuff. It's just like it kind of comes into your [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2743.0200000000004s)]

*  But it does illustrate like in real time what this would be like somebody like lost on their phone as his chicky likes [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=2770.7000000000003s)]

*  And people asking for things [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4463.04s)]
*  But even to weigh in on this or that i'm like a lot of fucking tasks. I didn't realize. Yeah, I don't realize how much [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4465.36s)]
*  Responsive that's what it was the overwhelming amount of responsibility [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4472.86s)]
*  And i'm not in a high responsibility field [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4478.32s)]
*  You know, that's true [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4481.599999999999s)]

*  Oh, it was so freeing before [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4492.88s)]
*  So here's what I noticed when I did the jew special [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4495.68s)]
*  It was weird because I've never done this before but I was living with a ghost for about five years [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4498.96s)]
*  I was living with a guy who was dead [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4503.04s)]
*  That that version of me isn't here anymore [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4505.04s)]
*  Right, like the yeshiva student the yeshiva kid. Yeah, he's gone. He's been long gone [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4508.0s)]
*  And I was living there and trying to remember this ancient religion and ancient time in my life [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4513.04s)]
*  And I was lost and it was a very lonely hour. Usually it's like in relation to other things [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4517.68s)]
*  And I finished it and I kind of came for air [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4524.16s)]
*  And I looked around and everybody was very angry [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4527.4400000000005s)]
*  I came back into the world [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4531.04s)]
*  And it was like everyone's mad about everything. Yeah [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4534.24s)]
*  um [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4538.16s)]
*  My friends were obsessed [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4539.04s)]

*  And it's like none of this concerns you [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4558.42s)]
*  None of this concerns you [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4560.9s)]
*  That that is a trans swimmer or that this covid vaccine or that it's like dude [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4562.98s)]

*  So I was like dropped out pop back in and everybody was on each other's throats. Everybody's so actively political [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4588.900000000001s)]
*  Uh, uh, I how do you avoid that? I don't read the news. I try to change the subject. I try to have [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4595.56s)]
*  I try to have tools [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4602.12s)]
*  Change the subject. How do you change the subject? [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4603.72s)]
*  How do you focus on positive only resolutely non-political person with a public voice left? [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4606.2s)]
*  There's a few of us my friend big j we were talking once we got a we did a week together in miami probably the worst city in america [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4612.4400000000005s)]

*  A girl growing up in florida. They will not reward your a plus in scott high school. They'll reward your new hairstyle. Yeah [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4631.5599999999995s)]
*  anyway, we got a beach house and we're talking he goes I like biden this was [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4639.24s)]
*  Three years ago. I was like, why do you like biden? You don't vote he goes [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4644.12s)]
*  I hear about him less than the other guy [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4647.0s)]
*  I'm like what a great reason to like one over the other. Yeah, we do hear way more about this guy than that guy [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4649.08s)]
*  What if you're a non-political? I just want you to be away from me you deal with it [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4654.92s)]
*  Um, yeah, you avoid it you learn how to change a subject [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4660.36s)]
*  But aren't aren't a lot of comedians pretty absorbed with it [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4663.48s)]
*  Yeah, but we don't even know anything. Yeah, i've noticed it's like we don't know anything. We're weighing in [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4666.92s)]
*  So here's what I do. It's like you start getting an argument and we're like well [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4671.96s)]
*  Mainly my stance is I don't care [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4675.88s)]
*  But if you're asking me to take a stance on ford verse chevy, you know something that doesn't matter. What do you think's better? It's like well [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4679.24s)]
*  95 of my reaction is I don't know or care whatever I can get a better deal on is good [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4686.66s)]
*  But with that other five percent i'm going to say I think chevy's better [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4692.2s)]
*  Why I just kind of feel that way [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4696.2s)]
*  Okay, so everybody's only publicly weighing in on their five percent and not their 95 percent, which is I don't give a fuck [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4698.36s)]
*  No one cares about women's college swimming [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4705.32s)]
*  No one's ever cared about women's college swimming. You don't think so? No [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4707.88s)]

*  It's a good way to do it [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4783.64s)]
*  Instead of like weighing in and go, I know you're right and weighing it. It's like keep talking [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4785.32s)]

*  And it was like I remember walking down the steps in my apartment then just collapsing on the steps [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4883.96s)]
*  And then like keep walking and then I met someone in front of the conference or another comic [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4889.5599999999995s)]
*  We just hugged and we sat on the on the on the sidewalk like with our feet on the street [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=4892.44s)]

*  No, it's nothing [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5254.68s)]
*  Even I even had an uber driver. I came back from charlotte [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5256.28s)]
*  I was doing a gig in charlotte when it happened and I came back sat on an uber driver and he was talking he was like, uh, [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5259.56s)]

*  It's just weird. They're I don't know. It's like it's it's sad but like [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5270.84s)]
*  There's him and his daughter and there's seven other people they don't seem to give a fuck about those seven other people [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5275.72s)]
*  And i'm like right right. That's fair. You got it [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5281.0s)]
*  That's that's where these jokes are when some celebrity dies and i'm mocking them online. It's because like you guys [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5283.72s)]
*  Value celebrity life over a normal life. Well, you also made a pretty biting point. I thought [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5289.22s)]
*  Well, i'll tell you my reaction which is I never criticize anyone when he dies. Okay, right? So there's that but i'm not a stand-up [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5295.64s)]
*  But I thought you made a totally fair point i'm not against kobe bryant, but he was credibly accused of rape [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5302.679999999999s)]
*  They hassled the woman until she dropped the dropped out right started spreading rumors about her seven other people seeming inside [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5307.4s)]
*  I was like no during the trial, right? [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5313.08s)]
*  And stuff we wouldn't hold by today and he he admitted that she never gave consent [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5316.28s)]
*  But he implied non-verbally that there was consent and that he strangled her [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5321.4s)]
*  So like there was something there his words [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5326.36s)]
*  Although at the time I didn't realize I now know she does not think she gave me consent [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5328.919999999999s)]
*  It's like all right [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5334.2s)]
*  so [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5335.799999999999s)]

*  He's also he's so clean on there [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5930.6s)]
*  But I don't think he's that clean [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5933.64s)]
*  I think he's like a boozer and a fun guy [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5935.8s)]
*  From what I hear. I don't know. So that's just totally that's not even a factor in comedy [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5938.76s)]
*  Yeah, I did like I did like when he goes uh when they were like [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5942.76s)]
*  Hey, you're losing the ratings to the other guy to the to the daily show guy [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5945.24s)]

*  But if you want to hear about a good lip sync battle, i'm your guy. Well good for him. Yeah exactly know who you are [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5957.8s)]

*  Make it a joke [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5968.92s)]
*  so many comics louis said this because comics fuck themselves over because [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5970.28s)]
*  They were like, it's just a joke. It's just a joke [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5974.44s)]
*  But as an audience member you're like but a lot of you guys are not joking legitimately you're making serious statements [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5975.96s)]
*  So how are we the audience to know when you're joking and when you're not? [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5980.92s)]
*  This guy might be the worst president of all time. That's not a joke. No make it a joke [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5984.92s)]
*  This guy's a worse president than kermit was at being a fucking I don't I don't know. I don't know [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5990.68s)]
*  But there's a joke possible [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5995.72s)]
*  So then what do you make of chapelle? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=5997.64s)]
*  In january is a great comment. Well, of course he is [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6000.6s)]
*  But there's also a seer and i'm not there's not a criticism. Yeah, just i've seen it of what? [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6003.400000000001s)]
*  Well, there's it it's it's all like his he did this the tranny special he did was like an editorial [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6008.52s)]
*  It was not he was not joking. He was serious. Is that good or bad? There's a thing i'll say that happens to a lot of people [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6016.4400000000005s)]
*  Um, you get some and it's not necessarily him [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6024.04s)]
*  Because everyone's on their own path [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6027.8s)]
*  But you get some backlash [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6030.04s)]
*  Yeah [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6032.6s)]
*  And then instead of just allowing that every backlash you want I think it comes from a place of you want to win those people over [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6033.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's like they're not the guy. You're not the guy they think [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6039.64s)]
*  And you want to win them over but then what happens is [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6042.68s)]
*  Your creative output is spent trying to win over people who hate you instead of trying to please the people who do love you [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6046.52s)]
*  And that's your core group and keep honoring them [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6054.44s)]
*  And these other people it sways them all it's so smart when the people go really I just got it [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6057.719999999999s)]
*  That is a really smart observation. Thanks buddy. It's not just comedy that no i'm saying [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6062.759999999999s)]
*  Fucking anti-semite. Well, we can all we can be is a brain. You have a high verbal intelligence. I'll say [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6067.639999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's a really insightful thing to say. It's not just comedians. By the way, he'd do that [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6073.5599999999995s)]
*  Right, right, right. Right. Yeah [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6077.32s)]
*  And then it just keeps going further and further over until you this warped fucking golem version of yourself [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6078.6s)]
*  Yes [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6084.120000000001s)]
*  And like what happened to you and i've seen it they won actually they won your enemies won the critics won [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6085.160000000001s)]
*  They they distorted you. Mm-hmm. And it's not even like let me do a good joke about this. It's hey, I was already done with that [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6090.280000000001s)]
*  So i'm not gonna keep doing jokes [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6096.84s)]
*  I'm not so people ask me about when I did this ju things like you should come out in a helicopter and do whatever i'm like [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6098.84s)]
*  Guys, that was a throwaway line on fucking three minutes [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6103.64s)]
*  I you only hear about so that's what you want me to be. I was never going to cover that again [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6106.759999999999s)]
*  That was the one joke about the fucking lakers [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6112.28s)]
*  I moved on to other stuff [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6114.92s)]
*  You want me to live in that forever? That's that's crazy. That's what you keep doing [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6116.759999999999s)]
*  Also artists do this when they get positive feedback [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6121.08s)]
*  Well, it's like i do a bunch of different paintings, but this one's about deer seem to sell more [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6123.799999999999s)]

*  Progression as a visual artist as a painter. So how do you keep in? [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6132.36s)]
*  Can't read any of it. You can't read any feedback positive feedback is just as deadly as negative [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6137.96s)]
*  Yeah, people tell you we like that you I liked you this is exactly right. Yeah, can't read anything can't allow it in [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6142.92s)]
*  That's right. You can you as a comic we got something that nobody gets is immediate reaction [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6149.0s)]
*  Uh, I can hear the laughs. Yes, we know when it's good and when it's bad [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6154.92s)]
*  And sometimes when you're starting somebody like no no, they were laughing in the back you couldn't hear i'm like they're facing me [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6159.0s)]
*  I can hear I got the best seat in the house for the laughs [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6163.88s)]
*  And I know when there's good laughs and bad laughs and I know even in that 15 minute set that I thought was bad [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6166.28s)]
*  There was one joke that killed and the other 14 were not good [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6170.5199999999995s)]
*  So i'm aware what the line was for this crowd and I failed and it's okay and they tell you like no [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6173.5599999999995s)]
*  There's that I can tell [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6178.5199999999995s)]
*  From immediate feedback. I don't have to go home and go who was saying anything about it online. I know what worked [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6180.839999999999s)]
*  Every time they come out with a thing against comics. They're like and this fucking crowd was like this crowd doesn't know me [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6187.400000000001s)]
*  Especially if it's at the cellar the stand or the comedy story. This is not our crowds [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6192.76s)]
*  They're just there for the show and we're going on and if you're making them laugh, that's a bunch of strangers laughing [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6196.360000000001s)]
*  That's all the feedback you need [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6201.400000000001s)]
*  or [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6203.08s)]
*  A bunch of strangers not laughing and that's also great feedback [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6204.12s)]
*  You know [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6207.72s)]
*  Occasionally you'll get a comedian go. Hey, there's something there. Don't give up on that joke. Wait, what? [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6208.76s)]
*  Everything you're saying is um true and wise more important [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6212.84s)]
*  But there's also the reality of touring for any gig, which is you wind up in a hotel room alone [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6217.08s)]
*  Yeah, and there's nothing to do. It's depressing and you're on your phone and you're like, I wonder what the reaction to this was [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6223.08s)]
*  That's fair and I should say this I fall [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6229.8s)]

*  There's no email on there [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6331.5599999999995s)]
*  There's a maps app but not google maps because they don't want those people don't be tracked [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6333.88s)]
*  So it's some other maps app. I think there is a ride share app [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6337.88s)]
*  um [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6342.84s)]
*  And some sort of music playing app I think but not spotify because they don't want anybody out of them you [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6344.759999999999s)]
*  The light phone 3 is about to come out with a camera unrelated like it takes a picture on [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6350.12s)]
*  So that's all I use my phone for so that would be for me. Yeah, I want one where I can't get this stuff on there [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6354.28s)]
*  I can't get email. I'll check it at home. I want to be able to text and not have to do this [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6360.44s)]
*  Which is fucking annoying, right? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6365.0s)]
*  So a full keyboard they used to have the one that flipped open like that [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6367.719999999999s)]
*  The lg envy and you can text like that flip phone, but you could text like that [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6370.84s)]
*  It's a breeze. Loved it. I gave up email [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6374.759999999999s)]
*  Completely no email. I don't do no email no email [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6377.719999999999s)]
*  How do you deal with like long form? [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6381.48s)]
*  I text that's it and I try to make I mean I i'm sure I miss a lot [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6383.48s)]
*  You know and I um, how does someone send you? Okay, so they can send you a link you can open read this [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6388.2s)]
*  Yeah, or pdf or I just don't deal with stuff [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6392.759999999999s)]
*  Wow, and because I think it's it's just it takes too much time. Yeah [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6395.879999999999s)]
*  I think i've lost probably half to a full decade of my life to this right? [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6401.0s)]
*  And so it might be worth saying, you know, i'm i'm an artist. I'm a creator. I'm a little eccentric [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6405.4s)]
*  I've got a weird personal life and i'm just not playing along with your conventions [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6410.839999999999s)]
*  You could probably pull that off. You're also in a position where you're successful enough [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6414.599999999999s)]
*  Where you'd be like guys deal with it for me like handle this [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6418.2s)]
*  Yeah, but there's not that much actually you can bang it out on text [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6421.799999999999s)]
*  And then then you can get to the bottom of it every day [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6425.0s)]
*  Then you go to sleep with nothing and make a phone call like hey explain this to me [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6427.639999999999s)]
*  Let's go over it real quick. It's gonna take us 10 minutes not texting. It'll take us five hours [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6431.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't talk it out a ton of phone calls out. Okay, because you can't do those at two in the morning [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6435.4s)]
*  Yeah [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6440.04s)]
*  Yeah, so you tell I wish there was a way to send a text schedule send a text [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6441.24s)]
*  Can you make more at some point will standards be able to make more money? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6445.72s)]
*  On the internet than they made on tv. They already are they already are. Yeah, they already are [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6450.68s)]
*  So it's like it's pretty wild the lack of caring they have for [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6455.4s)]
*  These conventions now some of the comics have made so much money. They've re-imprisoned themselves [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6460.04s)]
*  And that's why they usually come out against a comic who crossed the line because they're afraid of their own money kind of going away [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6465.64s)]
*  Instead of just defending their friends [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6471.88s)]
*  When when harvey weinstein came out? [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6473.96s)]
*  When it came out about harvey weinstein [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6477.0s)]
*  Um, they went to tarantino and it's like well you've worked with him. You need a way [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6479.32s)]
*  You need to make your statement and he said something along the lines of hey guys [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6483.64s)]
*  I've known this guy for 25 to 30 years. He was at my wedding. I was at his or vice versa whatever [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6487.08s)]
*  Um, this has been a friend for a long time. You need to give me some time to think about this [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6493.4s)]
*  And it seemed reasonable enough and they kind of went away and I don't even know if he ever said anything [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6497.88s)]
*  But what's saying anything going to do anyway? Exactly. You just they need more of that [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6502.12s)]
*  But they're all scared of losing their positions. They sell out their friends la comics more than new york [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6506.12s)]
*  So the more money they make the more cowardly they become [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6510.68s)]
*  We all wanted to do another our own thing and then this money in prison they had these jobs [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6513.24s)]
*  I mean I I make fun of rogan once in a while [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6516.92s)]
*  Where I was like I remember when he was still in la and I was like hey i'm coming to town [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6519.16s)]
*  I'm gonna go on a hike [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6523.0s)]
*  He goes, oh I can't I gotta interview some guy and I was like, I just cancelled he goes nice coming from australia [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6524.28s)]
*  I gotta fucking do it and I was like oh for your job [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6529.08s)]
*  He said shut up. All right, oh you wouldn't do it for millions of dollars. No, I would but don't ignore [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6532.6s)]
*  Are you worried about getting too successful where you can't take four months off and go to miyanmar? I I [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6537.0s)]
*  No [[01:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6544.76s)]
*  no [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6546.36s)]
*  The problem becomes when you have a like this guy and that guy where like you guys rely on me for money [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6547.48s)]
*  Yeah, so now it's a separate thing and that's when I didn't realize that's what comedy central did to me [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6553.08s)]
*  um, you got employees [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6558.44s)]
*  Well, they were like well, there's all these like [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6560.759999999999s)]
*  You have all these staff members. You have all these people going to shoot your show will kick you out [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6563.24s)]
*  They'll be out of work. They're not going to pay their rent or you can comply [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6567.0s)]
*  And you're like, oh fuck how horrible are they? [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6570.599999999999s)]
*  They're just really horrible [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6574.28s)]
*  Like they are right I get that that feeling they're done now they're elf which is sad because it was a good platform for comedians [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6576.28s)]
*  I don't take any [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6582.759999999999s)]
*  Happiness in their demise. So that's actually my last question is about is about the new platform for comedians [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6584.28s)]
*  Like how central is rogan to all this to this ecosystem? [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6589.16s)]
*  I mean he is the best the amount of support he has [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6592.679999999999s)]
*  I mean there's times where he goes so some big guy some oliver stone wants me to podcast but I can't I have this open [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6597.32s)]
*  Micro on today or tomorrow so i'm already booked. I want to promote this open micr [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6603.0s)]
*  Whereas everybody else would go well the name oliver stone will get more hits in this open micr [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6607.32s)]
*  So I can't he's just like i'm the i'm the name i'm joe rogan [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6611.16s)]
*  So I want to put this guy on or that guy on and this guy's funny. I want to push him to a big platform instead of like [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6614.92s)]
*  What's going to help me book my show? It's like interesting. I'll help me [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6622.2s)]
*  He's just the casual talking about the outlawness of stand-up has helped all of us [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6625.0s)]
*  Whether or not you've been on his show or not [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6630.52s)]
*  He's made stand-up more popular [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6633.08s)]
*  You know, so now we we can all just I mean it's succeeding in a lot. It's a crazy level [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6635.8s)]
*  So what like what's the effect on a stand-up's career of going on rogan? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6640.76s)]
*  Uh, well one time is not as big as as it once was because it's now there's thousands of episodes [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6647.72s)]
*  um [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6654.28s)]
*  But guys like theo von launched off like a good early appearance tim dillon launched off that dave smith, you know really [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6655.4s)]
*  Became well known. I know all three good guys. Yeah. Yeah, and you do well on that joey d as but like it was consistent ones [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6662.679999999999s)]
*  you know, um [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6670.04s)]
*  It's not like it's kind of like the tonight show with johnny carson was a long time ago [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6673.16s)]
*  It's like it what they say like you go on there. You're a star and everyone you talk to from back then like no [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6676.679999999999s)]
*  No, no, you're eighth time on there. You're a star [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6680.28s)]
*  But that whole week people recognize you but unlike carson, I mean rogan makes the call himself [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6683.08s)]
*  He doesn't have yeah like scouts in the clubs at night. Mm-hmm [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6688.2s)]
*  Yeah, he's like wow this lady was like [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6691.72s)]
*  female open micer [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6694.52s)]
*  We're all getting high in the back and then you have to walk past the original the the room [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6696.92s)]
*  And you kind of like go in there, especially if you're high or drunk. It's great watching some [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6701.88s)]
*  High level unknown comic you just it's it's great. It's laughs. You know, it's free laughs [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6706.04s)]
*  um [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6711.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's like you're passing by a live stand-up comedy show on your way out of work [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6713.08s)]
*  It's it's the best and he's in there laughing because you're great [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6717.160000000001s)]
*  He was always really great car simp the carlin was like that he'd sit in the back [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6720.04s)]
*  He knew who he was and if you did well, I'd be like, hey, that was really good set [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6723.4800000000005s)]
*  He knew not to just keep that to himself. He knew what george carlin saying good set would mean [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6726.76s)]
*  Did you know him? I met him once never said it to me [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6733.08s)]
*  But if I never had a good set like your shit at all ever had a good set in front of him [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6736.360000000001s)]
*  But uh, but if he was there and he saw you he tipped me 20 bucks to get him a deli sandwich [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6739.96s)]

*  And joey and he goes hey, i'm sorry. I'm giving you guys a raise [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6943.1s)]
*  But i'm like no one's offering us [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6946.46s)]
*  That much definitely not more he goes. No, you guys are headliners. You should make headliner money [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6948.62s)]
*  I'm giving you 250 a set so we'd come home with like as much money as I would make [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6952.54s)]
*  pretty much [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6957.58s)]
*  on my own headlining [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6958.78s)]
*  That I never got any work by the way, but like it would have been the same and also never touched my wallet [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6961.1s)]
*  And went out to the finest restaurants [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6966.38s)]
*  You know, it was it was great. That's amazing. Yeah, why do you think he does it? [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6969.18s)]
*  I don't know. He's a positive guy. So for a while. He just brought joey dies with him [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6973.5s)]
*  And then um, and joey was pretty coked up back then and sometimes he just would not show up [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6978.46s)]
*  Um [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6986.14s)]
*  And he could bring a local but he had to be supportive to the scene [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6989.18s)]
*  He got to help guys that are struggling and he brings his joey and then joey would he get to the airport [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6992.38s)]
*  He's like joey, where are you doing answer his phone and then he'd land in the new city. He's like, where are you goes? [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=6997.18s)]
*  Something came up. I missed my flight and it's like you I was at the airport. He missed your flight. He just [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7001.900000000001s)]
*  Coke excuses, you know, yeah [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7006.46s)]
*  And so he's just like he's unreliable. He might not show up it became too much [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7008.62s)]
*  But instead of saying you can't come anymore. He goes i'll just bring a second opener. So if you don't come i've still got somebody [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7013.26s)]
*  It's it's nuts to have an employee go. I just don't show up a lot like I guess i'll hire two employees then [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7021.74s)]
*  Just firing the guy [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7027.1s)]
*  He was like he's too funny. He's got to be supportive [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7028.780000000001s)]
*  It's our responsibility [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7031.26s)]
*  That's remarkable. Yeah, so I try to do that with like young comics. It's like, you know [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7033.34s)]
*  It doesn't one time I was wait. So when when your opener gets too high to to show up at the airport [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7038.3s)]
*  You're okay. No, i've never had a guy like that people are too whatever but like no i'm like i'll pay for your meals [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7043.66s)]
*  If we're out like at a diner after spots, it's like, ah, I got it. Don't worry about it because that's a real [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7047.900000000001s)]
*  I remember one of those he was like brand new to la he took us all out for like the standard hotel [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7053.02s)]
*  Um late night food he paid like three times in a row i'm brand new to line this isn't normal for someone you get around [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7058.219999999999s)]
*  But not consistently get rounds. That's weird [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7064.54s)]
*  And we're at carney's where it was a chilly dog place [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7067.179999999999s)]
*  And I was like, let me get this one. It was broke [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7071.0199999999995s)]
*  I couldn't afford the standard hotel, but the carney's like it's three dollars each, you know [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7073.82s)]
*  and um [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7077.98s)]
*  He goes no. No, it's okay. I'm like dude, please let me get there's also like a man sort of like hierarchy thing [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7079.0199999999995s)]
*  You can't pay him for me. I don't know you like that [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7084.46s)]
*  um [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7086.86s)]
*  And I insisted and he goes, okay. Thank you [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7088.22s)]
*  Appreciate that and then later we're walking back to the comments where he goes [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7091.18s)]
*  Hey, just so you know, like it's not a power position when I pay for you [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7094.14s)]
*  It's just like that standard meal for me is is about a quarter to you [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7096.86s)]
*  It's about worth a one five nickels. Yeah, that's why I pay for it. It doesn't it's it's meaningless [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7101.9800000000005s)]
*  It's not for power. I thank you for buying me carneys, but like [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7108.7s)]
*  That's all I have more money. So take some [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7112.3s)]
*  You know, like if I could just I just go get coffee at your spot [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7114.78s)]
*  I don't have to ask so when rogan got attacked when they tried to claim he was a racist of all things [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7117.820000000001s)]
*  Um, oh, yeah, it didn't see what it had like no effect. It had no effect [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7123.26s)]
*  Also comics supported him. I think this is what you gotta do when there's there's this like meteor of hatred coming at anybody [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7127.820000000001s)]
*  You get it plenty [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7133.66s)]
*  Uh other people have gotten to play. It's just meat [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7134.9400000000005s)]
*  It's solid ball and for a meteor to break up it needs to start breaking up and you get the image where it's like a piece [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7136.7s)]
*  Falls off a piece falls off in the atmosphere a piece falls off piece falls off [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7141.98s)]
*  So what support does from other people in your industry? [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7145.419999999999s)]
*  Either broadcasting or comedy is it shoots a fucking hole through that meteor a little hole and that starts to break it up [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7148.62s)]
*  A lot faster if you have a few commerce you go guys. You just don't understand comedy. That's just a joke [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7154.0599999999995s)]
*  He doesn't mean that you're out of your mind. It creates [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7159.0199999999995s)]
*  Doubt in the yes, that's right. And then it breaks up really fast when there's no doubt [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7162.379999999999s)]
*  It's just fucking ball that fuck sorry that fucking blows everything up [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7166.94s)]
*  What happened to look I don't know louis ck, but I I [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7170.46s)]
*  At the height of that. I always thought he was really talented. So I read about it and I [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7174.22s)]
*  You know, whatever was embarrassing that story, but it was not a crime that I could tell [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7178.38s)]
*  How did he wind up getting destroyed? [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7182.78s)]
*  For that puritanical. I think there's something in society like no matter if you're big we want you down [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7185.74s)]
*  I think it's because it says something about me that i'm not big instead of like let me rise up to his level [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7191.66s)]
*  Right, let me take you down. So in comedy it works in a few ways [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7196.94s)]
*  You're an evil person you steal jokes. You're hacky. You're um, um racist [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7200.78s)]
*  Roseanne racist carlos mancia steals jokes, uh, larry the cable guy [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7207.98s)]
*  Hacky these are all things I don't you know necessarily agree with or not agree with but this is what they say [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7212.54s)]
*  Uh, this guy lied about something. Uh, this guy did that but they're just like either way we're going to take you down [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7216.62s)]
*  It's not about one thing [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7221.9s)]
*  If it was about one thing i'd be like the society doesn't like that thing right but since it's about lots of things [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7223.34s)]
*  It's like what the common factor is you're big. You're all big. Let's take it down [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7228.62s)]
*  Um [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7234.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah with roseanne she offered like a [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7236.06s)]
*  Legitimate explanation that lady looks white [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7238.22s)]
*  I saw a picture of her. She looks like an old jewish lady. Yeah [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7240.78s)]
*  And then it's like that's a believable [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7244.06s)]
*  Fucking retort but it's like we want you out of here. Do you know her roseanne? I've met her a few times great person [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7246.62s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know her that well, but truly a cool interesting person lunatic absolutely 100% but in touch with [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7252.3s)]
*  Something deep she's not a shallow person vibe on stage and it's not even jokes [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7260.700000000001s)]
*  It's just a vibe and she just gets people on a wave like it's pretty pretty special [[02:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7265.02s)]
*  but um [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7269.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know they go after rogan they go after louis [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7270.780000000001s)]
*  I think it was that I think because what they were going after him for was puritanical [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7272.62s)]
*  Oh, yeah, it was you're not doing sex the way we do but [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7276.700000000001s)]
*  I mean when I was in college, I started bringing up verbal consent [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7280.459999999999s)]
*  and it was [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7283.66s)]
*  It was brought up by virgins [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7285.58s)]
*  Who had never really experienced sex? [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7288.459999999999s)]
*  If you ask any normal woman how they feel if a guy's like may I kiss you? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7292.379999999999s)]

*  And I guess he did it anyway [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7479.26s)]
*  And I saw him afterwards like hey great special same thing as the other one like just you know [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7480.7s)]
*  That's not the facts are wrong. Do what did you want just like that rabbi told me but like they did say yes [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7485.34s)]

*  But yeah, it's like let me get the facts right definitely. Um [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7497.26s)]
*  So anyway [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7502.14s)]

*  And say what happens so with louis it's like he asked someone [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7522.46s)]
*  For two girls come back to your hotel room, which by the way [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7526.62s)]
*  Always implies women aren't idiots. You know what they want at least you know what they want [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7530.46s)]
*  No victim blaming, but if I walk out with a hundred, but there are no surprises if you right this is you know [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7536.219999999999s)]

*  you know [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7559.34s)]
*  So anyway, if you defend him, it's like he asked for verbal consent and got it [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7560.54s)]
*  And they go well as high-powered manager try to shut these girls up or this is the defend them game or his friend [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfZjJuskLLs&t=7564.7s)]
