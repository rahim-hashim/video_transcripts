# Banned Opposition Leader Călin Georgescu: Antony Blinken & Emmanuel Macron Killed Romanian Democracy
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk)
*  First of all, I wish to mention that all my actions represent nothing but a selfless sense of duty to my people, to my Romanian people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=0.0s)]
*  And of course, I have a dream of freedom and dignity for the Romanian people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=15.0s)]
*  I was denied by the globalist mafia, which they control this region like a colony. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=23.0s)]
*  And of course, it's the same, let's say, intelligence group also present in this region, as well as the group which they try to destroy the campaign of President Trump as well. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=38.0s)]
*  It was just a copy-paste with different subjects, including that I was falsely accused about foreign interference, particularly, of course, the Russian interference, exactly as President Trump was accused in the past. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=58.0s)]
*  Nevertheless, there is no evidence. And of course, related to this foreign interference, I would just to mention that ULSA system, 100% in Romania, was and it is coordinated and controlled by foreign interference. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=81.0s)]
*  Before these elections was controlled by the former Secretary of State from United States, Blinken, and all the neocons. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=103.0s)]
*  And after the President Trump and Trump-Vance administration is totally controlled by France. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=115.0s)]
*  So actually, the current Romanian president today is President of France Macron. So, Suresh Macron, if I can say. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=124.0s)]
*  Yeah, yes. In any case, the point is that very clear, I was an outsider. And because I was an outsider, they didn't control and or didn't, let's say, had any any suspicion in the early beginning, in the first round about this I'm speaking. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=139.0s)]
*  And my narrative was totally devoted to my people and was totally related to what we can do alone, how we can be how we can be Romanian independence. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=166.0s)]
*  And with this narrative, including a program which I present for Romania, food, water and energy. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=182.0s)]
*  I succeed in the first round on the first place. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=190.0s)]
*  And in the moment when you are outsider. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=195.0s)]
*  Of course, they alert immediately because they can lose, they realize they can lose the power and the money. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=199.0s)]
*  Moreover, the most important point was in the moment when I said when I pronounce the word peace, the immediately they alert in the moment when I said peace because they need war. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=211.0s)]
*  And this was the main important point. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=227.0s)]
*  After the first round. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=231.0s)]
*  Everything. Let's say the system was alert immediately. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=233.0s)]
*  And everybody knows that the Romanian people that was for interference, which they control totally the situation. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=238.0s)]
*  And of course, the, the system in Romania just they put into practice what they decide, in a sense to to ban me immediately. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=250.0s)]
*  So in the second round. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=261.0s)]
*  Was started in December, six, with Romanian living outside of the country. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=265.0s)]
*  We had three days voting process. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=273.0s)]
*  So we start on six, was seven and eight in Romania. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=278.0s)]
*  So in the, in the day of six. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=282.0s)]
*  In the afternoon, they cancel totally the elections. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=286.0s)]
*  The process was started in the morning. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=294.0s)]
*  Until afternoon I had almost 70%. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=297.0s)]
*  And they stopped the council. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=302.0s)]
*  So the second round of election was illegally and unconstitutionally canceled. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=307.0s)]
*  They stolen the vote. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=313.0s)]
*  Totally. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=315.0s)]
*  And they accused me as I said, they forced me accused me about Russian interference. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=317.0s)]
*  Of course, there are not evidence and until today when me and you we have this interview is no evidence at all. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=324.0s)]
*  Just to underline that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=333.0s)]
*  Is copy paste as President Trump suffer a lot during his campaign. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=337.0s)]
*  Absolutely the same situation. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=343.0s)]
*  They didn't come with any new stuff. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=345.0s)]
*  Just the same one. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=350.0s)]
*  But in any case, they consider that they don't have to come back anymore to the second round. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=354.0s)]
*  And they promote another elections, which they are coming in the month of May. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=363.0s)]
*  This year. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=369.0s)]
*  So in one month from now. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=370.0s)]
*  Which is another fraud. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=373.0s)]
*  Even bigger than before. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=375.0s)]
*  This I wish to be very clear. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=377.0s)]
*  I made an application also for the second elections. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=380.0s)]
*  They black me again. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=385.0s)]
*  And in this moment. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=390.0s)]
*  Legally, I have no rights to. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=393.0s)]
*  Participate to any campaign for the position as President of Romania. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=397.0s)]
*  I wish to to mention to you the most important point, which in fact. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=405.0s)]
*  They alarm them. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=412.0s)]
*  And the most important is peace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=416.0s)]
*  Peace and freedom. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=419.0s)]
*  Because to the second one, just I want to say that they have fear. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=422.0s)]
*  Of free Romania. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=428.0s)]
*  More than fear war. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=430.0s)]
*  This I wish to be very clear. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=435.0s)]
*  The second one. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=437.0s)]

*  Genuine peace. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=450.0s)]
*  Exactly as President Kennedy said in 1963. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=452.0s)]
*  In front of American University. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=457.0s)]
*  Was a fantastic speech. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=459.0s)]
*  And today. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=461.0s)]

*  In. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=485.0s)]
*  One or two minutes I can tell you. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=487.0s)]
*  Every third person. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=489.0s)]
*  Says today. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=491.0s)]

*  I fear. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=504.0s)]
*  This is a most important point of control of them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=506.0s)]
*  The only thing. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=511.0s)]
*  We have to fear. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=513.0s)]
*  Is fear itself. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=515.0s)]
*  Said President Roosevelt in 1933. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=517.0s)]
*  And this is absolutely exactly today. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=520.0s)]

*  Confident and unafraid. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=530.0s)]
*  We must labor. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=532.0s)]
*  Towards for the strategy of peace. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=535.0s)]
*  This is a most important point. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=537.0s)]
*  And I wish to ask you. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=540.0s)]
*  One point also myself. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=543.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=545.0s)]
*  We know how much cost. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=546.0s)]
*  The war. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=548.0s)]
*  But you know how much cost the peace. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=549.0s)]
*  How much cost. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=552.0s)]
*  How much cost it because everybody. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=554.0s)]
*  We are talking about peace. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=557.0s)]
*  But it's not implemented. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=559.0s)]
*  So the only chance. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=561.0s)]
*  In the real sense. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=563.0s)]
*  Which I can see and this was. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=565.0s)]
*  The main important point. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=567.0s)]
*  In Romania which I have seen also. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=569.0s)]
*  Not only. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=571.0s)]
*  What I said myself but what they said Romanian people. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=573.0s)]
*  Is President Trump. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=576.0s)]
*  It's only chance for everybody to arrive at the peace. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=578.0s)]
*  To back to democracy. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=581.0s)]
*  Not only in the United States. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=583.0s)]
*  Everywhere. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=585.0s)]

*  It's not just you we're all being watched. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=589.0s)]
*  Every time we go online. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=592.0s)]
*  Data brokers record everything you do when you sign on. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=594.0s)]
*  Your phone. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=597.0s)]
*  Your iPad. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=598.0s)]
*  Your computer doesn't matter. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=599.0s)]
*  People are watching you and some people think that's fine. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=600.0s)]
*  You've got nothing to hide. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=602.0s)]
*  But that's exactly the story they tell you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=604.0s)]
*  To get you to lower your guard. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=607.0s)]
*  The more you expose yourself. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=609.0s)]
*  The more money they make by selling information about you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=611.0s)]
*  It's pretty sick actually. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=614.0s)]
*  Congress has not banned it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=616.0s)]
*  And instead. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=618.0s)]
*  The rest of us are here to fend for ourselves. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=619.0s)]

*  To win. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=750.0s)]
*  The first round. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=752.0s)]

*  About peace. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=756.0s)]
*  During the campaign. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=758.0s)]
*  They asked me only. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=760.0s)]
*  For war. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=762.0s)]
*  Only permanent. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=764.0s)]
*  And permanently I spoke about peace. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=766.0s)]
*  So this was all the campaign. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=768.0s)]
*  And of course. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=770.0s)]
*  Another point. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=772.0s)]
*  Very very. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=774.0s)]
*  Very important. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=776.0s)]
*  Was my program food water and energy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=778.0s)]

*  To change. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=784.0s)]
*  The system of Romania. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=786.0s)]
*  And this was based. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=788.0s)]
*  As. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=790.0s)]
*  Everybody who knows about. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=792.0s)]
*  Hamilton. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=794.0s)]
*  Ideology. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=796.0s)]
*  I wish to make. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=798.0s)]
*  In a sense to be totally. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=800.0s)]
*  Independent. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=802.0s)]
*  To provide. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=804.0s)]
*  Performance economy. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=806.0s)]
*  But depends only by. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=808.0s)]
*  Your natural resources. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=810.0s)]
*  Not by that. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=812.0s)]
*  This was a situation. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=814.0s)]
*  So we can be. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=816.0s)]
*  A Hamiltonian. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=818.0s)]
*  Powerhouse. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=820.0s)]
*  In Eastern Europe. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=822.0s)]
*  Side or also in Europe. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=824.0s)]
*  Just because we have to follow. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=826.0s)]
*  The best. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=828.0s)]
*  Which we had in the world. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=830.0s)]
*  And one of the best which I recognize myself. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=832.0s)]
*  Is the. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=834.0s)]
*  Founding father of United States. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=836.0s)]
*  Alexander Hamilton. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=838.0s)]
*  So this was the. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=840.0s)]
*  And for this I was accused. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=842.0s)]
*  That I'm not good enough for them. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=844.0s)]
*  Well you are. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=846.0s)]
*  Prevented. I mean your democracy. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=848.0s)]
*  Was shut down. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=850.0s)]
*  But if you're against war. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=852.0s)]
*  And against debt. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=854.0s)]
*  You had to know that those are the two. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=856.0s)]
*  Issues that really matter. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=858.0s)]
*  To the globalist war and debt. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=860.0s)]
*  They're in favor of both. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=862.0s)]
*  So were you surprised when you were accused. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=864.0s)]
*  Of being a Russian agent and kicked out of. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=866.0s)]
*  Romanian politics. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=868.0s)]
*  You know. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=870.0s)]
*  They cannot. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=872.0s)]
*  How I can say. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=874.0s)]
*  It's impossible to change. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=878.0s)]
*  So fast. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=880.0s)]
*  So I can tell you what they did. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=882.0s)]
*  It's. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=884.0s)]
*  It's not a surprise for me. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=886.0s)]
*  They are not. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=888.0s)]
*  Destroying the democracy. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=890.0s)]
*  They are destroying lives. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=892.0s)]
*  And it's not about. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=894.0s)]
*  Democracy. It's about. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=896.0s)]

*  People free. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=900.0s)]
*  This is very important. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=902.0s)]
*  To know. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=904.0s)]
*  And. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=906.0s)]
*  This showed to us. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=908.0s)]

*  We have. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=918.0s)]
*  We have not democracy. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=920.0s)]
*  Because it's impossible to. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=922.0s)]
*  To find so many things. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=924.0s)]
*  Today. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=926.0s)]

*  Well simply was. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=996.0s)]
*  An intervention. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=998.0s)]
*  They don't. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1000.0s)]
*  Very clear. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1002.0s)]
*  They don't need. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1004.0s)]
*  Free Romania. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1006.0s)]
*  And. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1008.0s)]
*  Free Romania. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1010.0s)]
*  To be mentioned that. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1012.0s)]
*  The largest. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1014.0s)]
*  Military base. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1016.0s)]
*  Of NATO. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1018.0s)]
*  Is. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1020.0s)]
*  Is in Romania. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1022.0s)]
*  Probably you know about that. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1024.0s)]
*  And of course they want to. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1026.0s)]
*  To. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1028.0s)]

*  World War III. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1034.0s)]
*  From Romania. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1036.0s)]
*  And with this situation of course. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1038.0s)]
*  They can involve. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1040.0s)]
*  All Europe. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1042.0s)]
*  And also United States. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1044.0s)]
*  So these they have interest. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1046.0s)]
*  They have interest in war. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1048.0s)]
*  What do you mean they want to launch. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1050.0s)]
*  World War III from Romania. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1052.0s)]
*  Because. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1054.0s)]
*  Let me tell you how. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1056.0s)]
*  Is a situation. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1058.0s)]
*  It's a key gateway. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1060.0s)]
*  Which can. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1062.0s)]
*  Can cancel. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1064.0s)]
*  Can protect. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1066.0s)]
*  The humanity to go in the war. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1068.0s)]
*  Or can go. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1070.0s)]
*  To the war. Why? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1072.0s)]
*  Because it's the largest boundary. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1074.0s)]
*  Which Romania has is Ukraine. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1076.0s)]
*  We discussed about 380 miles. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1078.0s)]
*  Only for Romania. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1080.0s)]
*  In compare. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1082.0s)]
*  Poland has almost. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1084.0s)]
*  330 miles. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1086.0s)]
*  And Hungary. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1088.0s)]
*  Around 80 miles. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1090.0s)]
*  Geographical. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1092.0s)]
*  Geographically. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1094.0s)]
*  Is very important as well. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1096.0s)]
*  So the largest. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1098.0s)]
*  Boundary. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1100.0s)]
*  Again. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1102.0s)]
*  For Ukraine is Romania. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1104.0s)]
*  And. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1106.0s)]
*  In this situation of course. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1108.0s)]
*  Romania. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1110.0s)]
*  Is the asset. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1112.0s)]
*  For European Union. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1114.0s)]
*  For Macron. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1116.0s)]
*  In order to launch. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1118.0s)]
*  The war. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1120.0s)]
*  Strategically. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1122.0s)]
*  So number one. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1124.0s)]
*  Is the most important. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1126.0s)]
*  Strategical point. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1128.0s)]
*  Romania. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1130.0s)]
*  Is a security framework. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1132.0s)]
*  For the Black Sea. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1134.0s)]
*  Is a region influence. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1136.0s)]
*  Regional influence. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1138.0s)]
*  For Moldova. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1140.0s)]
*  And also is a leverage. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1142.0s)]
*  For economic and for energy situation. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1144.0s)]
*  And they know. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1146.0s)]
*  About that. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1148.0s)]
*  They know very well about that. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1150.0s)]
*  They want to turn. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1152.0s)]
*  NATO. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1154.0s)]
*  On an. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1156.0s)]
*  Offensive force. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1158.0s)]
*  And we know very well. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1160.0s)]
*  That NATO is defensive. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1162.0s)]
*  Organization. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1164.0s)]
*  And this was my point. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1166.0s)]
*  All the time. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1168.0s)]
*  First of all I said is not our war. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1170.0s)]
*  We have nothing to do. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1172.0s)]
*  We have nothing to do. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1174.0s)]
*  We have nothing to do. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1176.0s)]
*  We have nothing to do. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1178.0s)]
*  The national interest is. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1180.0s)]
*  Diplomatic negotiation. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1184.0s)]
*  And we can be. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1186.0s)]
*  A peace mediator. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1188.0s)]
*  Romania. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1190.0s)]
*  And they don't like that. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1192.0s)]
*  Because they want to. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1194.0s)]
*  Of course. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1196.0s)]
*  They want to cover many things. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1198.0s)]
*  Which even today. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1200.0s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1202.0s)]
*  Exactly what. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1204.0s)]
*  They pushing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1206.0s)]
*  For war. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1208.0s)]
*  And of course my position was exactly. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1210.0s)]
*  Against them. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1212.0s)]
*  Was totally contrary. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1214.0s)]
*  That. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1216.0s)]
*  So the most important. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1218.0s)]
*  Is that the people are. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1220.0s)]
*  Behind me. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1222.0s)]
*  And all the. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1224.0s)]
*  Romanian people of course. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1226.0s)]
*  They. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1228.0s)]
*  Almost the majority of Romanian. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1230.0s)]
*  People of course they have this position. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1232.0s)]
*  Against. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1234.0s)]
*  Any intervention. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1236.0s)]
*  And any participation. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1238.0s)]
*  For war. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1240.0s)]
*  They know my position and of course. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1242.0s)]
*  For this reason they cancel immediately. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1244.0s)]
*  Any way. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1246.0s)]
*  For me in order to arrive to candidates. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1248.0s)]
*  For presidents. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1250.0s)]
*  Even that today. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1252.0s)]

*  When me and you were talking. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1256.0s)]
*  We have this interview. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1258.0s)]
*  I have more than. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1260.0s)]

*  and I'm sure [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1368.0s)]
*  one point [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1370.0s)]
*  that [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1372.0s)]
*  if [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1374.0s)]
*  if [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1376.0s)]
*  United States particularly [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1378.0s)]
*  wants an [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1380.0s)]
*  alliance, not a [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1382.0s)]
*  vessel, an alliance, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1384.0s)]
*  very strong, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1386.0s)]
*  they have to support the patriots [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1388.0s)]
*  particularly from Romania [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1390.0s)]
*  and other Brussels bureaucrats. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1392.0s)]
*  So we are [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1394.0s)]
*  sure that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1396.0s)]
*  in one day everything can be turned. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1398.0s)]
*  Today [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1400.0s)]
*  or tomorrow, but it will happen. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1402.0s)]
*  You know Romania [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1404.0s)]
*  right now is a most [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1406.0s)]
*  important country in the world. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1408.0s)]
*  It's Alpha [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1410.0s)]
*  and Omega. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1412.0s)]
*  For a new era of peace, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1414.0s)]
*  of dignity, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1416.0s)]
*  of love, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1418.0s)]
*  prosperity. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1420.0s)]
*  And I'm saying this because it's a boundary [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1422.0s)]
*  between bad [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1424.0s)]
*  and good. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1426.0s)]
*  And this boundary [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1428.0s)]
*  has to be [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1430.0s)]
*  closed. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1432.0s)]
*  Because if we close [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1434.0s)]
*  this door for war [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1436.0s)]
*  that means peace. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1438.0s)]
*  If we open this key gate, as I said [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1440.0s)]
*  in the beginning, it's a war. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1442.0s)]
*  And we don't have to [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1446.0s)]
*  have this. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1448.0s)]
*  I mean my opinion is that this war [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1450.0s)]
*  is a shame of humanity. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1452.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1454.0s)]
*  And it's [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1456.0s)]
*  there is not [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1458.0s)]
*  any rational human [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1460.0s)]
*  justification [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1462.0s)]
*  for endorsing [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1464.0s)]
*  war. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1466.0s)]
*  Doesn't exist. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1468.0s)]
*  So what they [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1472.0s)]
*  don't like is [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1474.0s)]
*  if Romania breaks [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1476.0s)]
*  free, [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1478.0s)]
*  we'll follow other countries. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1480.0s)]
*  You understand me? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1482.0s)]
*  So this they don't need. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1484.0s)]
*  It will be a [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1486.0s)]
*  domino's fall. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1488.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1490.0s)]
*  And this [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1492.0s)]
*  terrifies them [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1494.0s)]
*  that one country, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1496.0s)]
*  particularly Romania, to be free. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1498.0s)]
*  But this is our values [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1500.0s)]
*  which we want to share. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1502.0s)]
*  This is our flag which we want to share [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1504.0s)]
*  with the United States and also with other countries. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1506.0s)]
*  Peace, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1508.0s)]
*  democracy and freedom. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1510.0s)]
*  We don't give up. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1512.0s)]
*  This is our values. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1514.0s)]
*  And we have to go straight [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1516.0s)]
*  to that. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1518.0s)]
*  Even the situation looks now [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1520.0s)]
*  complicated. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1522.0s)]
*  In one day [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1524.0s)]
*  can be changed. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1526.0s)]
*  Because [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1528.0s)]
*  we have been in our [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1530.0s)]
*  lands [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1532.0s)]
*  since time [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1534.0s)]
*  immemorial. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1538.0s)]
*  So [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1542.0s)]
*  we are here [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1544.0s)]
*  from the early beginning of the history. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1546.0s)]
*  And all [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1550.0s)]
*  our [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1552.0s)]
*  history [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1554.0s)]
*  is plain by [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1556.0s)]
*  heroes, by [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1558.0s)]
*  kings, devoted [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1560.0s)]
*  to the country and to the land. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1562.0s)]
*  Romanian people [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1564.0s)]
*  is a brave people, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1566.0s)]
*  is a great people. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1568.0s)]
*  And we discuss also that [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1570.0s)]
*  exactly like Maga [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1572.0s)]
*  make America great again, we said [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1574.0s)]
*  make Romania great again. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1576.0s)]
*  Because we strongly believe [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1578.0s)]
*  in our power. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1580.0s)]
*  We strongly believe in us. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1582.0s)]
*  We strongly believe [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1586.0s)]
*  that this is our land [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1588.0s)]
*  which we did receive from Brussels [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1590.0s)]
*  or from other [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1592.0s)]
*  countries, we received from God [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1596.0s)]
*  with his power of love. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1598.0s)]
*  We trust in God. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1600.0s)]
*  We setting on [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1602.0s)]
*  on [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1604.0s)]
*  energy resources. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1606.0s)]
*  We love our families. We believe [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1608.0s)]
*  in Christianity [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1610.0s)]
*  and in Christian [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1612.0s)]
*  families. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1614.0s)]
*  We believe in our land. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1616.0s)]
*  So we shall win. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1618.0s)]
*  Sooner or later we shall [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1620.0s)]
*  win. Of course [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1622.0s)]
*  it's a matter of time. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1624.0s)]
*  And I can understand again [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1626.0s)]
*  that you cannot change the system [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1628.0s)]
*  in one hour. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1630.0s)]
*  My narrative [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1632.0s)]
*  exactly was this during the campaign. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1634.0s)]
*  I don't want to [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1636.0s)]
*  change the people. I want to change the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1638.0s)]
*  system. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1640.0s)]
*  And for this they are afraid [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1642.0s)]
*  about me and afraid [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1644.0s)]
*  about the people which are behind me. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1646.0s)]
*  So [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1648.0s)]
*  I recognize [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1650.0s)]
*  only one [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1654.0s)]
*  important partner, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1656.0s)]
*  the United States, particularly [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1658.0s)]
*  in the moment [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1660.0s)]
*  when we have [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1662.0s)]
*  this administration, Trump, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1664.0s)]
*  and President Trump is our [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1666.0s)]
*  guarantee that he can solve [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1668.0s)]
*  the situation in Europe. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1670.0s)]
*  He can solve the situation as [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1672.0s)]
*  peace everywhere because [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1674.0s)]
*  you know, I can tell you that [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1676.0s)]
*  President Trump is not only [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1678.0s)]
*  a leader in the United States. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1680.0s)]
*  He's a leader [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1682.0s)]
*  in the world because [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1684.0s)]
*  a real leader, a leader in fact [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1686.0s)]
*  saves [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1688.0s)]
*  lives. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1690.0s)]
*  Don't send people [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1692.0s)]
*  to death. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1694.0s)]
*  And if we [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1698.0s)]
*  know that and if we believe [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1700.0s)]
*  on that, we strongly believe on that, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1702.0s)]
*  we shall succeed [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1704.0s)]
*  sooner or later. For this [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1706.0s)]
*  reason I said that Romania is the most important [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1708.0s)]
*  country in the world. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1710.0s)]
*  And I know very well what I'm saying [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1712.0s)]
*  because it's exactly [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1714.0s)]
*  the key gates [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1716.0s)]
*  to close the door [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1718.0s)]
*  or to open the door, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=1720.0s)]

*  very well in this [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2086.0s)]
*  pandemic, [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2088.0s)]
*  which they want to control us [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2090.0s)]
*  beside any other things. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2092.0s)]
*  Also, they want to control [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2094.0s)]
*  the vote. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2096.0s)]
*  And in the end, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2098.0s)]
*  I can tell you that [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2100.0s)]
*  the most important is that [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2102.0s)]
*  we expose [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2104.0s)]
*  with this situation is corruption. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2106.0s)]
*  You ask me how I can feel [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2108.0s)]
*  how is the situation. I feel good [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2110.0s)]
*  because we expose the corruption [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2112.0s)]
*  after so many years. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2114.0s)]
*  We expose them [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2116.0s)]
*  to dramatically situation [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2118.0s)]
*  where we are. That in fact [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2120.0s)]
*  we have not anymore democracy. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2122.0s)]
*  Because it's impossible, even [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2124.0s)]
*  that was a foreign interference [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2126.0s)]
*  or other interference [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2128.0s)]
*  by whatever, because I said [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2130.0s)]
*  I was based [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2132.0s)]
*  on voluntary support [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2134.0s)]
*  in my campaign, but even [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2136.0s)]
*  was interference, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2138.0s)]
*  how you can destroy the democracy [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2140.0s)]
*  in, you know, in few weeks. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2142.0s)]
*  This does mean that [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2144.0s)]
*  we have not democracy [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2146.0s)]
*  anymore. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2148.0s)]
*  And here we are. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2150.0s)]
*  Moreover, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2152.0s)]
*  of course, they [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2154.0s)]
*  don't like the position, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2156.0s)]
*  the system of President Trump [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2158.0s)]
*  and in general, the position [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2160.0s)]
*  of administration Trump [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2162.0s)]
*  and they are totally [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2164.0s)]
*  related with what [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2166.0s)]
*  European Union [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2168.0s)]
*  does [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2170.0s)]
*  right now. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2172.0s)]
*  And you know very well that [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2174.0s)]
*  European Union establish [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2176.0s)]
*  globalist [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2180.0s)]
*  government [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2182.0s)]
*  with unelected people. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2184.0s)]
*  Even [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2186.0s)]
*  Ursula [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2188.0s)]
*  Bordenlein [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2190.0s)]
*  is not an elected person. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2192.0s)]
*  She was just [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2194.0s)]
*  nominated. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2196.0s)]
*  So we have to fight [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2198.0s)]
*  globalist [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2200.0s)]
*  globally, this I wish [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2202.0s)]
*  to mention, globally. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2204.0s)]
*  We [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2206.0s)]
*  cannot accept [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2208.0s)]
*  just islands [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2210.0s)]
*  of sovereignty. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2212.0s)]
*  In the ocean [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2214.0s)]
*  of globalist, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2216.0s)]
*  we have to understand [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2218.0s)]
*  that we need a global [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2220.0s)]
*  network of sovereignty [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2222.0s)]
*  countries. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2224.0s)]
*  So we have to be an union [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2226.0s)]
*  of countries which [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2228.0s)]
*  we fight for sovereignty. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2230.0s)]
*  Because the flag [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2232.0s)]
*  of peace, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2234.0s)]
*  democracy and freedom [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2236.0s)]
*  which United States [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2238.0s)]
*  today has, we have [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2240.0s)]
*  to keep also this flag. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2242.0s)]
*  And also [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2244.0s)]
*  countries around us. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2246.0s)]
*  And in fact, [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2248.0s)]
*  all of us, we have [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2250.0s)]
*  to work and to fight for peace. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2252.0s)]
*  Not just to stay [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2254.0s)]
*  to wait a decision from someone. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2256.0s)]
*  It's in our capacity [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2260.0s)]
*  to demonstrate [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2264.0s)]
*  that the human being [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2266.0s)]
*  has a power [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2268.0s)]
*  to fight for peace [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2270.0s)]
*  and for democracy. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2272.0s)]
*  Otherwise, we are just slaves. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2274.0s)]
*  You know, I was accused [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2276.0s)]
*  that I want to [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2278.0s)]
*  kick out Romania from European Union [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2280.0s)]
*  and from [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2282.0s)]
*  NATO. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2284.0s)]
*  So my answer [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2286.0s)]
*  also time was the following. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2288.0s)]
*  I like the alliance [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2292.0s)]
*  only if they serve [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2294.0s)]
*  the nations. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2296.0s)]
*  Not to enslave it. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2298.0s)]
*  I wish to be very clear. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2300.0s)]
*  Not to enslave it. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2302.0s)]
*  In this moment, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2304.0s)]
*  we are just a client [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2306.0s)]
*  state. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2308.0s)]
*  Just a client state. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2310.0s)]
*  And this [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2312.0s)]
*  must end. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2314.0s)]
*  Because we are not slaves. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2318.0s)]
*  We are free people. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2320.0s)]
*  And I said to you [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2322.0s)]
*  from the very beginning, I have a dream. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2324.0s)]
*  And my dream [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2326.0s)]
*  is freedom, dignity [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2328.0s)]
*  for the Romanian people. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2330.0s)]
*  For this [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2332.0s)]
*  we have to fight. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2334.0s)]
*  And we don't give up. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2338.0s)]
*  Because we know that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2340.0s)]
*  it's in our power and together with [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2342.0s)]
*  God we can succeed. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2344.0s)]
*  Because God is with us. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2346.0s)]
*  And it's normal to be this situation [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2350.0s)]
*  because show us [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2352.0s)]
*  how wrong [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2354.0s)]
*  was this system. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2358.0s)]
*  And how many problems. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2360.0s)]
*  And how I can say [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2364.0s)]
*  violation of [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2366.0s)]
*  the human rights [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2368.0s)]
*  they did [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2370.0s)]
*  until today. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2372.0s)]
*  So it's very important [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2374.0s)]
*  that the corruption [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2376.0s)]
*  was exposed. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2378.0s)]
*  And all the situation was exposed. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2380.0s)]
*  Because we are living [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2382.0s)]
*  under [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2384.0s)]
*  a cartel [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2386.0s)]
*  of [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2390.0s)]
*  censorship [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2392.0s)]
*  and lawfare. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2396.0s)]
*  They are using [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2398.0s)]
*  the law just for them. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2400.0s)]
*  You understand me? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2402.0s)]
*  Not for the people. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2404.0s)]
*  Exactly as President Trump [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2406.0s)]
*  had [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2408.0s)]
*  all these problems [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2410.0s)]
*  in the campaign. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2412.0s)]
*  Because censorship is [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2414.0s)]
*  a political police. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2416.0s)]
*  A political [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2420.0s)]
*  persecution [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2422.0s)]
*  and legal abuse [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2424.0s)]
*  which we are facing today. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2426.0s)]
*  It's a situation [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2430.0s)]
*  which is incredible to have [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2432.0s)]
*  in a term in Romania. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2434.0s)]
*  In the situation when [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2436.0s)]
*  we consider that we are in [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2438.0s)]
*  European Union, we are NATO members. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2440.0s)]
*  We have a common understanding [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2444.0s)]
*  about what we have to do. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2446.0s)]
*  No, this is not. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2448.0s)]
*  We have to change the system. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2452.0s)]
*  Exactly as I proposed to change the [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2454.0s)]
*  economic system. Exactly as I said [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2456.0s)]
*  about [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2458.0s)]
*  Hamilton presence [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2460.0s)]
*  and ideology. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2462.0s)]
*  We have to change all these things. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2466.0s)]
*  Otherwise we remain [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2468.0s)]
*  just slaves [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2470.0s)]
*  in our own country. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2472.0s)]
*  We have [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2474.0s)]
*  rich natural resources. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2476.0s)]
*  We have to [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2478.0s)]
*  consider that [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2480.0s)]
*  we have to base on our natural resources [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2484.0s)]
*  not to debt. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2486.0s)]
*  Because what they offer to us [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2488.0s)]
*  they offer [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2490.0s)]
*  technocracy [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2492.0s)]
*  and debt. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2494.0s)]
*  And I propose to Romanian people [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2496.0s)]
*  and to [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2498.0s)]
*  other countries [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2500.0s)]
*  freedom and dignity. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2502.0s)]
*  This is my offer. Instead of [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2504.0s)]
*  technocracy and debt. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2506.0s)]
*  Even if they prefer this [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2508.0s)]
*  they prefer because [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2510.0s)]
*  they [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2512.0s)]
*  abuse all these people [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2516.0s)]
*  so many years. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2518.0s)]
*  And exactly as I said, they have [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2520.0s)]
*  to consider a free country [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2522.0s)]
*  as Romania could be. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2524.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2526.0s)]
*  Thank you Mr. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2528.0s)]
*  Gjescu. Thank you for spending this time [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eat9NlWfKwk&t=2530.0s)]
