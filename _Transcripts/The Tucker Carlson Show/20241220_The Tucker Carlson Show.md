# Jenner Furst Secret Chinese Biotech Programs, and the Documentary That Could Put Dr. Fauci in Jail
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E)
*  Thank you, Dr. Fauci. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=0.0s)]
*  So I lived at the beginning of COVID in Northwest DC [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2.6s)]
*  where I'd been most of my life [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  and there were actual yard signs that said, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=7.0s)]
*  thank you, Dr. Fauci. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=9.8s)]
*  Yeah, the title is ironic. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=11.8s)]
*  But I don't think, so you told me before we went on [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=14.88s)]
*  that you're from Brooklyn, Massachusetts originally. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  I spent most of my life in Northwest DC. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=19.8s)]
*  They're very similar, well-educated, affluent, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=21.34s)]
*  enormous self-regard. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=26.16s)]
*  These are communities that think a lot of themselves. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  And it was those communities in retrospect [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=31.8s)]
*  that were the ones that posted the thank you, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=34.72s)]
*  Dr. Fauci signs. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=36.44s)]
*  Am I imagining that? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=37.8s)]
*  No, that happened. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=38.92s)]
*  Yeah, but in those specific communities, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=40.400000000000006s)]
*  in the richest, best educated communities, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=42.68s)]
*  I don't think you saw a lot of thank you, Dr. Fauci signs [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  in Gary, Indiana or Detroit. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=48.16s)]
*  You saw them in Bethesda, Santa Monica, Brookline, DC. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=49.52s)]
*  Yeah, and I'd lived in New York for two decades [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=55.28s)]
*  by that point and I don't think a lot of people [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=58.92s)]
*  in New York were thanking Dr. Fauci. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=61.24s)]
*  I don't think the sanitation workers [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  were thanking Dr. Fauci. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=65.92s)]
*  The nurses weren't thanking Dr. Fauci. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=66.76s)]
*  I mean, it's a farce. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  It's an illusion. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=69.68s)]
*  The truth is far from that. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=71.44s)]
*  Professor Putnamчес is [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=73.8s)]
*  editor of Says American [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=78.94s)]
*  Magazine [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  and journalist [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=80.84s)]
*  Great [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=81.78s)]
*  Real [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=87.74000000000001s)]
*  army [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  brother [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=95.68s)]
*  and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=98.88s)]
* い [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=100.0s)]
*  And but I want, because everything is so politicized, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=101.56s)]
*  particularly COVID, I just want to be clear for our viewers [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=106.12s)]
*  who you are. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=110.16s)]
*  Opposition to COVID policy, to mandatory vaccination, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=114.36s)]
*  questions about where the virus came from, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  these are kind of staples on the right. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=121.08s)]
*  They weren't at the time, by the way, I can tell you, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=123.16s)]
*  but they are now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=124.68s)]
*  And silence and signs that say thank you, Dr. Fauci, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=126.64s)]
*  are sort of signifiers of liberalism. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=130.36s)]
*  I don't quite know how that happened, but it did. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=132.88000000000002s)]
*  Where are you? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=134.8s)]
*  I'm nowhere, honestly. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to use my brain about what happened. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=138.8s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=141.8s)]
*  And I don't think I can, I think I've lost confidence [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  in all political tropes about this topic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  And it really helped me see what was happening before [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=152.68s)]
*  with every other topic, because I consider myself [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=157.68s)]
*  a cynical person. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=161.8s)]
*  I've been investigating these type of scandals [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=163.12s)]
*  and crimes for a long time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=166.24s)]
*  COVID was about 10 times or a hundred times bigger [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=167.6s)]
*  than any fraud or crime I've ever investigated. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=170.82s)]
*  And I think politics really was key to the manipulation, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=175.44s)]
*  dividing people, and I just see it in everything now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  Keys to manipulation, so that implies you don't think [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  politics drove it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  Politics was a tool that the people behind this used [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=188.08s)]
*  to subdue the population? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=192.52s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the folks who are in positions [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=194.0s)]
*  of enormous power, power that I think is greater [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  than nation states, really, it's transnational global power, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  corporate power, I think that they benefit greatly [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=206.60000000000002s)]
*  from the population being divided and fighting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=210.84s)]
*  amongst themselves about issues that are not even the truth. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=213.76s)]
*  And in this case, 99% of people on the planet were abused, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=217.72s)]
*  they were poisoned, close to 20 million of them were killed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=223.28s)]
*  And in that context, they all lost, and a very small, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  small portion of people on this planet, in the thousands, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=233.72s)]
*  benefited greatly, even though they were responsible [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=238.68s)]
*  to some extent for this crime. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  And so it's insane to think that for the people [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=244.34s)]
*  who were responsible for this, that it was a win-win scenario [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=248.22s)]
*  for them, while the rest of the planet was clearly [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=252.1s)]
*  a lose-lose scenario. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  There's nothing political about that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=255.89999999999998s)]
*  I feel like pounding my fist on the table in agreement. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=257.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=259.94s)]
*  That's so nicely put. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=260.78s)]
*  Okay, let's start at the beginning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=262.42s)]
*  What was this virus, where did it come from? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  I think that, I wanna give you an easy answer. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=267.38s)]
*  But I think, I don't think we're ever gonna know [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=271.7s)]
*  exactly the moment that this virus emerged from a lab, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=273.74s)]
*  but we do know that the virus did not emerge [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=278.74s)]
*  from the wet market in Wuhan, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=280.66s)]
*  and that it didn't emerge in December, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=282.58000000000004s)]
*  it likely emerged in August, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=284.42s)]
*  and that it was the product of research [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=287.22s)]
*  that was funded by the United States, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=290.66s)]
*  and the writing was on the wall that this research [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=294.02000000000004s)]
*  could have caused a pandemic for five years, at least, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=297.22s)]
*  and there were regulations in place not to fund this research [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=301.5s)]
*  that Fauci and others violated to fund this research. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=304.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=307.5s)]
*  So in that context, whether it got on someone's sleeve [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=308.34000000000003s)]
*  on their way to lunch, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=312.34000000000003s)]
*  or whether it was released intentionally, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=313.3s)]
*  everything we know about this virus has been a lie. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=316.02s)]
*  So the form of research that created it is called, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=320.14s)]
*  often called gain of function, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=323.38s)]
*  which in crude terms effectively makes a virus, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=325.7s)]
*  it's manipulation of a virus to make it more dangerous [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  in order, say, researchers [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  to create more effective vaccines against it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=333.34s)]
*  I think that's correct. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=335.09999999999997s)]
*  That's the company line. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=336.26s)]
*  That's the company line. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=338.06s)]
*  But it's so self-evidently reckless [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=339.18s)]
*  that it was banned, or sort of banned, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=342.02s)]
*  under the Obama administration. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=345.62s)]
*  Is this correct? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=347.74s)]
*  Yeah, it's an interesting story. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=348.58s)]
*  It's really what you'll see in the film, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=350.34s)]
*  is that on the surface, you have this scandal with COVID, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=353.22s)]
*  you have this virus that doesn't appear to be natural, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=356.58s)]
*  and you have a cover-up, clearly. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=359.98s)]
*  I mean, if we can't prove the moment the virus leaked, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=362.58s)]
*  or the exact origin, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=365.18s)]
*  we can prove that there was a cover-up. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=367.02s)]
*  There's more than enough evidence to do that right now. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=368.74s)]
*  But the story didn't start with COVID. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=373.3s)]
*  The story started almost 20 years ago. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=375.5s)]
*  The story started really after 9-11, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=377.66s)]
*  and you have a country that's reeling from a terrorist attack, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=380.38s)]
*  and then the anthrax attacks happen, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=384.29999999999995s)]
*  and Anthony Fauci raises his hand [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=386.7s)]
*  to be the point person for bio-defense research. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=389.82s)]
*  And all of a sudden, billions of dollars go to his department, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=394.58s)]
*  and really out of the supervision of the Pentagon, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=399.09999999999997s)]
*  and other areas of the government that had regulated it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=402.62s)]
*  And for the last 20 years, this has been a debate. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=405.97999999999996s)]
*  And the sort of coverage that was happening during the pandemic [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=409.62s)]
*  really thrived on the idea that this came out of nowhere, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=414.9s)]
*  and it's a natural disaster, and we all need to band together, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=417.94s)]
*  and we don't know much about what it is, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=421.86s)]
*  and we just need to be patient with the government, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=423.34s)]
*  patient with the science, patient with the medicine. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=426.21999999999997s)]
*  It was the opposite. We knew all about this virus. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=430.41999999999996s)]
*  It had been researched for close to a decade. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=432.94s)]
*  The vaccine for this virus was in research [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=435.41999999999996s)]
*  for almost five years prior to the virus happening. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=437.66s)]
*  And many scientists, like the folks in my film, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=441.58s)]
*  have been ringing the alarm that this was an existential risk [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=445.94s)]
*  to humanity for close to two decades. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=449.74s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=453.22s)]
*  It's absurd. It's insane. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=455.3s)]
*  Those are big facts to keep secret for five years. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=456.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=460.62s)]
*  And there were other, and what I discovered in looking into it [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=462.02s)]
*  was that you start to see a pattern [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=465.18s)]
*  and that there were other events. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=468.26s)]
*  In fact, you brought up Obama regulating gain of function. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=470.06s)]
*  Well, that happens right at the same time [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=474.1s)]
*  that there's an Ebola outbreak in West Africa. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=475.94s)]
*  And there is a connection to gain of function research [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=479.02s)]
*  as a potential origin for that outbreak, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=483.26s)]
*  and it was successfully covered up. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=485.18s)]
*  And you find the same people who were implicated in that outbreak, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=487.5s)]
*  including Anthony Fauci, on secret teleconferences [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=490.74s)]
*  right after the news breaks about COVID. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=494.1s)]
*  And they actually happen to be people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=496.98s)]
*  who write the most passionate papers that COVID came from nature, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=499.5s)]
*  people who were previously suspected [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=503.14000000000004s)]
*  of being the source of a lab leak. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=506.22s)]
*  So we can say those people were lying [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=507.78000000000003s)]
*  when they claimed it came from the wet market in Wuhan? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=510.66s)]
*  I think that there's no way a reasonable person [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=513.38s)]
*  can look at the evidence here [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=516.62s)]
*  and think that people were telling the truth, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=519.5s)]
*  think that Anthony Fauci was telling the truth, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=521.9s)]
*  think that the scientists who wrote these papers [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=524.42s)]
*  wrote them with any ethical standards [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=526.58s)]
*  and that they didn't commit fraud. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=529.86s)]
*  It appears that they all committed some form of fraud, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=531.86s)]
*  whether it be scientific fraud. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  Some of these crimes are felonies. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=537.02s)]
*  They committed perjury. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=539.3000000000001s)]
*  Multiple scientists committed perjury in front of Congress. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=541.1s)]
*  Anthony Fauci committed perjury in front of Congress. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=543.78s)]
*  But what we have to remember about Fauci [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=547.34s)]
*  is he's been playing this game for 50 years. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=550.38s)]
*  He knows how DC works. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=552.46s)]
*  He knows how to operate. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=553.7800000000001s)]
*  And the reason why he may get away with committing perjury [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=557.38s)]
*  is because he was the one who made the regulations, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=561.74s)]
*  for the most part, on what gain of function [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=564.5s)]
*  would be and would not be. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=566.7800000000001s)]
*  And he excluded that dangerous research in Wuhan. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=568.6600000000001s)]
*  And on paper, it wasn't gain of function. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=571.74s)]
*  And that's the type of game that's been played [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=575.4200000000001s)]
*  for, like I said, decades now. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=578.02s)]
*  I have too many questions. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=580.26s)]
*  I don't want to overwhelm you with unrelated questions. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=581.1s)]
*  No, no, no, but there's- [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=583.7s)]
*  You know a lot, but I also want to speak in a way [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=584.54s)]
*  that people can approach this story [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=587.34s)]
*  because it's mind-bending. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=589.58s)]
*  So let me just go back before I lose the thread. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=591.46s)]
*  You mentioned this has been going on [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=593.98s)]
*  since the anthrax attacks, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=595.58s)]
*  which really were the pretext that Fauci used [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=596.86s)]
*  to grab all this money and power. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=600.02s)]
*  Well, we can't blame Fauci for all of it. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=601.78s)]
*  It was really Dick Cheney who had been very successful [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=603.78s)]
*  at using 9-11 to achieve other things, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=607.42s)]
*  like an invasion of Iraq. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=610.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and the erosion of all of our civil liberties, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=612.0200000000001s)]
*  the permitting torture, violating the Geneva Convention. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=616.46s)]
*  These things were all in play after 9-11 [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=620.38s)]
*  because we were in a war against terror. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=623.0200000000001s)]
*  And anthrax was painted as a continuation [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=625.58s)]
*  of the war against terror. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=629.58s)]
*  The truth is, is that as Bush and Cheney were leaving office, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=631.34s)]
*  it was released that anthrax was not a terrorist attack. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=635.58s)]
*  Anthrax was an inside job from a scientist at Fort Detrick, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=640.62s)]
*  one of our bio weapons facilities. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=644.14s)]
*  So I remember that vividly. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=646.18s)]
*  I had White Powders sent to my house, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=648.98s)]
*  had the bio team come at that, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=650.42s)]
*  you know, 2001, I'll never forget it. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=651.78s)]
*  But we never really got a definitive answer on who sent. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=657.4599999999999s)]
*  I mean, there was the person, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=660.74s)]
*  first Stephen Hadfield was accused falsely by the media, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=662.38s)]
*  including the media organization I worked for at the time. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=666.62s)]
*  There was another guy that's since died. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=668.9s)]
*  Well, died is a very generous way [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=673.98s)]
*  of putting what may have happened to him. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=678.54s)]
*  Do you think he did it? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=681.78s)]
*  Do you think he was murdered? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=682.7s)]
*  I think that when he began saying that he didn't act alone [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=684.9s)]
*  and that the media's version of his story [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=691.14s)]
*  was very far from the truth. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=693.34s)]
*  And when members of Congress started believing [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=695.02s)]
*  that he didn't act alone, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=697.7s)]
*  he suspiciously committed suicide [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=699.1800000000001s)]
*  by taking a bunch of Tylenol. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=703.5s)]
*  So I don't really know many accomplished scientists, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=706.1400000000001s)]
*  bio terrorists, experts, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=710.7s)]
*  people who understand all the different compounds [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=713.74s)]
*  that can kill them very peacefully and very fast, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=715.7s)]
*  who would take a lot of acetaminophen to kill themselves. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=718.38s)]
*  It's just very suspicious. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=720.98s)]
*  And the timing was even more suspicious. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=723.46s)]
*  And I think what I learned was that in many ways, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=725.58s)]
*  Anthony Fauci's whole sort of advancement [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=730.0600000000001s)]
*  into this unchecked power [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=733.4200000000001s)]
*  and to becoming the most prominent scientist on the planet, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=735.0600000000001s)]
*  the largest funder of biomedical research on the planet [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=740.26s)]
*  was predicated on a hoax. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=744.7800000000001s)]
*  And to this day, he's never admitted [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=747.26s)]
*  that anthrax was not a terrorist attack. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=749.4200000000001s)]
*  And you can't find that anywhere in his book. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=752.62s)]
*  If it wasn't a terror attack, what was it? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=755.06s)]
*  Anthrax was a false flag attack. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=757.8599999999999s)]
*  And anthrax like 9-11 allowed for the complete deregulation [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=759.9399999999999s)]
*  of bio weapons research, of bio defense research. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=764.3399999999999s)]
*  And if you go back in time, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=768.14s)]
*  you see this confluence of things. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=770.54s)]
*  You see the science advancing in very exciting ways, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=773.54s)]
*  like CRISPR, the ability to edit genes, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=777.9799999999999s)]
*  to do things we've never been able to do before. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=781.06s)]
*  And you see this idea that we're under attack [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=783.58s)]
*  and that the enemy may use unconventional means to attack us. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=788.1s)]
*  And bio weapons immediately came into focus [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=793.86s)]
*  because of the anthrax attack. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=797.98s)]
*  And that was used to fund a lot of countermeasures, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=800.1s)]
*  quote unquote countermeasures for bio weapons. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=804.1s)]
*  But the interesting thing about gain of function [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=807.7800000000001s)]
*  and the interesting thing about doing this research [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=810.7800000000001s)]
*  in the first place is that in order to create [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=812.86s)]
*  a countermeasure for an agent that's never been known [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=816.7s)]
*  or created or a virus that doesn't exist, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=821.26s)]
*  you have to create the agent and the virus. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=823.86s)]
*  And so it creates a weapon, a pandemic [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=827.02s)]
*  that has never been seen by man before [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=832.94s)]
*  and arguably carries more risk than it carries benefit. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=835.7s)]
*  And Fauci was almost evangelical about this research [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=840.74s)]
*  to the point that it was suspicious. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=845.22s)]
*  And scientists like Richard Ebright and others, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=847.58s)]
*  the Cambridge Working Group, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  I mean, the debate started almost directly [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=852.4200000000001s)]
*  after anthrax and Fauci began doing this research. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=854.98s)]
*  I mean, the debate started in like 2002 [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=858.46s)]
*  that we should not be directing all of our research dollars [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=861.5s)]
*  into this one narrow field of quote pandemic preparedness. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=865.22s)]
*  And yet Fauci did and amassed so much influence and power [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=871.0600000000001s)]
*  in that system that he was able to shut down every critic. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=877.0600000000001s)]
*  And there were a lot of close calls [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=880.82s)]
*  and there were a lot of red flags, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=882.62s)]
*  after anthrax and before Ebola. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=887.0600000000001s)]
*  Fauci supported the engineering of avian flu in 2011 [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=890.38s)]
*  to make it airborne. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=895.1400000000001s)]
*  Bird flu is not naturally airborne. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=896.94s)]
*  It takes a while to transfer from its host, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=899.46s)]
*  birds to humans, happens with pigs, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=903.74s)]
*  it happens with other intermediate species. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=906.94s)]
*  And a scientist supported by Anthony Fauci [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=909.5s)]
*  used gain of function techniques [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=913.34s)]
*  in order to hone the virus to be airborne in humans. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=915.58s)]
*  So this was celebrated by Fauci as a victory of science. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=921.74s)]
*  There was a big debate on whether the results [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=927.22s)]
*  of this study should even be published. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=930.14s)]
*  They were published. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=931.9399999999999s)]
*  And Fauci and Francis Collins, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=933.5799999999999s)]
*  who was also the NIH director at the time of the pandemic [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=935.3s)]
*  and very much part of the whole problem that we faced, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=938.2199999999999s)]
*  they wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=945.6999999999999s)]
*  and said that this was a flu risk worth taking, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=947.8199999999999s)]
*  that doing this dangerous research could cause a pandemic, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=951.38s)]
*  but that it was a risk worth taking [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=955.02s)]
*  because we would be prepared for that pandemic. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=956.74s)]
*  Prepared with vaccines. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=959.9s)]
*  Yeah, and therein lies the next sort of issue is that, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=962.42s)]
*  I think clinicians, doctors who treat people, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=967.82s)]
*  folks that are pragmatic will take any remedy [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=971.74s)]
*  or any countermeasure that's effective [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=976.42s)]
*  to help their patients and would- [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=978.94s)]
*  In fact, I would replace the word pragmatic with humane. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=982.1s)]
*  Any way to stop suffering, anything. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=985.54s)]
*  So do your job was just to heal. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=988.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=990.66s)]
*  And I think that Fauci represents sort of almost [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=992.14s)]
*  this paternal grandfather-like figure, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=996.98s)]
*  self-proclaimed because no one asked for this, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1003.66s)]
*  whose job felt less about protecting people [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1007.34s)]
*  or developing things that could help all sorts of people [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1011.38s)]
*  and more about carrying a line [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1015.34s)]
*  on what was important in science [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1019.18s)]
*  and digesting science for people in a way that was, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1020.9s)]
*  if you look back, very infantilizing. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1025.46s)]
*  Well, this is how this works and that's how this works. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1028.1s)]
*  And if you listen to him at a podium, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1031.14s)]
*  he has an incredible bedside manner, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1032.86s)]
*  but he's failing to tell you [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1035.54s)]
*  every conflicting piece of evidence. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1037.7s)]
*  He's failing to tell you every piece of gray. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1041.74s)]
*  It's very black and white. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1045.02s)]
*  And he'd been doing that for years. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1047.1399999999999s)]
*  And I think the vaccine work- [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1049.8999999999999s)]
*  But there's always the bottom line. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1050.74s)]
*  Yeah, right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1051.58s)]
*  And the bottom line is the vaccine. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1052.4199999999998s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1054.06s)]
*  And so he's not a virologist. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1054.8999999999999s)]
*  He's an immunologist. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1057.58s)]
*  And really in many ways, his focus is vaccinology. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1059.34s)]
*  And so there are such things as virologist, epidemiologist, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1064.34s)]
*  and all those people were supported [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1069.5400000000002s)]
*  by his funding, his research, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1071.7800000000002s)]
*  but Fauci appeared to have one goal [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1074.18s)]
*  and one solution for problems, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1077.5800000000002s)]
*  which was to develop vaccines for them. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1079.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1081.46s)]
*  And I think like many doctors and scientists would agree, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1082.5s)]
*  vaccines are very important. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1088.0600000000002s)]
*  In fact, there could be a pandemic coming any day now [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1090.0600000000002s)]
*  that a vaccine may be the only thing to stop it. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1094.22s)]
*  And so much damage, this is very ironic, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1097.62s)]
*  so much damage was done by Fauci and others [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1100.4199999999998s)]
*  to the concept of vaccines [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1103.02s)]
*  that it could be a real tragedy when we actually need [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1104.46s)]
*  a vaccine and people are so distrustful of public health. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1109.78s)]
*  And I think that when you have very powerful people [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1114.9399999999998s)]
*  who have been in DC for decades, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1118.86s)]
*  they live in a bubble where they forget [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1121.46s)]
*  what the rest of the world is doing, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1123.78s)]
*  the way the rest of the world think. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1125.82s)]
*  And for some reason, in their calculus, in their head, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1127.5800000000002s)]
*  Fauci and others thought that this was the way [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1130.8600000000001s)]
*  to talk to people, these were the things to do, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1134.38s)]
*  and maybe they didn't understand the catastrophic risk. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1136.42s)]
*  It was five years ago this month [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1139.9s)]
*  that people started to drop dead [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1141.74s)]
*  in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1143.3s)]
*  Five years since the beginning of COVID, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1145.74s)]
*  tens of millions dead, societies reordered completely, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1147.94s)]
*  economies destroyed, and yet for some reason, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1151.98s)]
*  we still don't know answers to the most basic questions. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1154.5s)]
*  Where did this virus come from? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1157.74s)]
*  How did it get here? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1159.18s)]
*  Why did the government tell us to do things [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1160.62s)]
*  they knew wouldn't work? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1162.62s)]
*  None of those questions have been adequately answered, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1163.94s)]
*  and one man knows those answers. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1166.22s)]
*  His name is Dr. Tony Fauci. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1168.1s)]
*  Until now, nobody has really pressed, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1169.86s)]
*  and now a documentary filmmaker called Jenner First [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1172.9s)]
*  is out with a new film explaining exactly what happened. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1175.54s)]
*  The film is called Thank You, Dr. Fauci. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1179.98s)]
*  Jenner First spent years trying to get answers, [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1182.34s)]
*  and in that time, as he awaited Dr. Fauci's response, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1184.58s)]
*  he went through tens of thousands of pages of documents [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1187.54s)]
*  and pieced together the story, which is shocking. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1190.78s)]
*  We are proud to host that documentary here on TCN [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1193.02s)]
*  from December 20th to January 19th. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1195.94s)]
*  You will see it exclusively here on TCN. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1198.26s)]
*  Again, it's called Thank You, Dr. Fauci, and it's worth it. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1200.54s)]
*  Maybe, maybe there's another explanation. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1204.22s)]
*  One of the things that I learned but never hadn't known before [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1207.22s)]
*  was that there are a lot of people [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1210.14s)]
*  in our public health establishment [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1212.94s)]
*  who think vaccines are the point. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1214.22s)]
*  The point. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1217.74s)]
*  And this has gone on. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1219.54s)]
*  I've never been against vaccines, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1220.9s)]
*  and, you know, always been grateful for the Salk vaccine, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1222.14s)]
*  et cetera. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1225.14s)]
*  Took a bunch of vaccines myself. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1226.22s)]
*  But I'm not against vaccines. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1228.58s)]
*  I'm not against vaccines. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1230.74s)]
*  I'm not against vaccines myself. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1232.14s)]
*  But I always assumed that they were sort of tools [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1234.46s)]
*  used by physicians to heal people, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1237.0600000000002s)]
*  to save people from illness. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1240.0600000000002s)]
*  I didn't realize that this mindset [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1241.46s)]
*  was very different from that. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1245.0600000000002s)]
*  They were almost like vaccines were the point. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1246.0600000000002s)]
*  And this goes back, you know, I mean, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1249.26s)]
*  Diego Rivera, I think, painted a mural panel about vaccines. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1252.0600000000002s)]
*  Like, the worship of vaccines for their own sake [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1256.0600000000002s)]
*  is longstanding, and I don't understand it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1260.26s)]
*  Do you have any insight? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1262.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1263.26s)]
*  I mean, I think that if we looked [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1263.6599999999999s)]
*  at every other part of our government, our society, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1265.1799999999998s)]
*  that we can see the influence of money and, you know, companies. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1269.46s)]
*  And sadly, public health is no different [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1274.98s)]
*  than any other industry, any other part of our government. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1277.98s)]
*  They lobby. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1282.62s)]
*  They spend a lot of money. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1284.1s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry spends a lot of money. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1285.34s)]
*  There's a lot of money to be made on sick people. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1287.86s)]
*  And sadly, folks in positions that [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1290.54s)]
*  are making policy for America, which in many ways [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1295.18s)]
*  leads the world in a lot of this stuff, is very influential. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1298.58s)]
*  Those folks are sometimes compromised. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1302.54s)]
*  And I think that what you brought up about vaccines, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1305.62s)]
*  you can see the same thing across the rest [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1309.54s)]
*  of the pharmaceutical industry, that many times there [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1311.62s)]
*  is a cheap and effective cure for something that costs $2, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1315.02s)]
*  and it's not going to get promoted, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1319.26s)]
*  and it's not going to get talked about. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1320.82s)]
*  Because a new drug has to be developed, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1322.62s)]
*  and a new treatment has to be developed. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1325.62s)]
*  And instead of focusing on a ton of different things [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1328.58s)]
*  that could have stopped people from dying, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1331.5s)]
*  let's just take the research aside. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1334.26s)]
*  Let's just take the part that America [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1335.78s)]
*  could be responsible for the pandemic in the first place [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1338.26s)]
*  and that absolutely tragic crime. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1340.98s)]
*  The way that the public health establishment, in many ways [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1346.94s)]
*  run by Anthony Fauci, and I can explain that a little bit more, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1350.98s)]
*  had one focus, and that was to develop a vaccine. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1357.3s)]
*  And that people like Bob Redfield [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1361.22s)]
*  would tell you that it wasn't even the vaccine that [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1362.92s)]
*  could be the safest. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1366.7s)]
*  It wasn't the vaccine that could be the most reliable. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1367.78s)]
*  It was the vaccine that was going to be an mRNA vaccine. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1371.3s)]
*  And that really was the core of influence inside Warp Speed. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1374.94s)]
*  It was Moderna and Pfizer, and they [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1379.7s)]
*  got the first bite of the apple. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1381.54s)]
*  And J&J, of course, and AstraZeneca, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1383.5s)]
*  they also were part of it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1385.42s)]
*  But this mRNA technology, Fauci had [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1387.18s)]
*  been talking about it for years. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1389.52s)]
*  And it initially was for cancer. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1392.3400000000001s)]
*  It didn't work. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1394.3s)]
*  And they had shifted about four or five years [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1395.46s)]
*  before the pandemic into developing a pan-coronavirus, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1397.78s)]
*  pan-influenza vaccine. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1401.5s)]
*  And a lot of that research was happening in places like Wuhan. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1403.6599999999999s)]
*  And so it was almost a reverse engineered scenario, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1407.34s)]
*  where the number one cure for this virus [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1412.7399999999998s)]
*  was going to be an mRNA vaccine. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1415.7399999999998s)]
*  Despite the science, or regardless, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1417.8999999999999s)]
*  or whatever the testing or the safety, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1421.58s)]
*  that's what had to happen. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1423.7199999999998s)]
*  But the nature of an mRNA vaccine [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1425.58s)]
*  assisting from conventional vaccines is risky. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1428.3s)]
*  It's very risky, and it's also a miracle of science. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1432.82s)]
*  It's that we can teach our bodies [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1436.86s)]
*  how to fight these things and this kind of taking vaccine [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1438.5s)]
*  technology to the next level. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1442.62s)]
*  I mean, I think a layman would say correctly [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1445.34s)]
*  that in doing that, you're potentially tampering [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1447.6599999999999s)]
*  with the formula of life. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1450.26s)]
*  And we're not that intelligent as a life force. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1452.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, we use about 10% of our brains. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1457.1s)]
*  So to think that we could manage the fallout [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1459.26s)]
*  or the blowback in species that are a billion years old, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1462.62s)]
*  I think is extremely pompous and insane of humans to think that. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1466.78s)]
*  And that's what scientists also believed, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1472.3s)]
*  who didn't get the air time and who many of them [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1475.1s)]
*  their career suffered when they challenged Fauci [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1478.2199999999998s)]
*  on this premise, that this gain of function work, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1480.4199999999998s)]
*  forget about the vaccines, which are the flip side, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1485.26s)]
*  just the gain of function work alone [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1487.4199999999998s)]
*  is playing master of the universe. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1489.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes, and the idea of an mRNA vaccine itself [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1490.7s)]
*  sort of raises a lot of questions. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1494.38s)]
*  Are you sure that's a good idea? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1495.94s)]
*  Well, it's interesting that we're coming to this [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1497.18s)]
*  four or five years later. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1513.78s)]
*  I think if you look at a pattern of horrible scientific [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1515.98s)]
*  accidents and catastrophes, bad policy, bad products, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1520.06s)]
*  it takes usually a decade, 20 years, 50 years. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1524.3s)]
*  You'll see in the film, it's interesting [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1528.4199999999998s)]
*  you brought up Salk. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1529.8999999999999s)]
*  Salk had a competitor that was the oral polio vaccine. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1531.46s)]
*  And they were both racing to complete trials [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1536.02s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1538.26s)]
*  And there's data that suggests that that scientist, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1540.06s)]
*  Hilary Kroposki, who was in the Belgian Congo, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1542.86s)]
*  was using chimpanzee kidneys to propagate his polio vaccine [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1546.54s)]
*  against the concerns of a lot of scientists [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1551.78s)]
*  who worried that viruses could go from chimpanzees [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1554.98s)]
*  to humans really easily. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1558.58s)]
*  We have very similar DNA. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1559.7s)]
*  And he did those trials in 57 to 59. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1562.22s)]
*  And the first articulated outbreak of HIV [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1566.54s)]
*  is in 1959 in the same city that he did those trials. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1570.42s)]
*  And therein lies the most complex, hard to fathom [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1575.94s)]
*  conundrum. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1584.3s)]
*  You have people trying to save the world, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1585.3s)]
*  racing to save the world, trying to cure polio. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1587.18s)]
*  And they unintentionally cause another pandemic, potentially. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1590.42s)]
*  And fast forward 75 years, and it happened again. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1595.46s)]
*  And that is really what this story is about. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1602.1000000000001s)]
*  You can't play God with this stuff. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1606.3799999999999s)]
*  I mean, these things are, there's [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1608.42s)]
*  no way to model all the blowback. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1611.46s)]
*  Well, they're living organisms, for one thing. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1613.22s)]
*  They're not static. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1615.1s)]
*  So you can't fully understand them. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1615.86s)]
*  You can't. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1618.94s)]
*  And when you layer in arrogance, and you layer in unchecked power, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1619.58s)]
*  and you layer in lack of transparency and oversight, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1625.46s)]
*  the amount of damage that can be done from this work [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1630.1s)]
*  is exponential. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1633.62s)]
*  It's exponential at that point. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1635.62s)]
*  When you have people who haven't been challenged for 20 years [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1638.34s)]
*  on their decisions, and who have amassed so much power, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1641.58s)]
*  and just put yes men around them, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1644.8999999999999s)]
*  that's what the NIAID was. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  That's what the NIH was. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1649.06s)]
*  You've got to remember, out of anyone in HHS, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1650.6999999999998s)]
*  the overarching organization, Fauci [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1653.34s)]
*  was the most senior person in that entire organization. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1656.2199999999998s)]
*  And in many ways, I think he was seen [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1659.34s)]
*  as the most powerful person in that organization. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1661.78s)]
*  So if you look at the story of COVID, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1664.78s)]
*  you've got the CDC director, Bob Redfield, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1667.06s)]
*  who's known Fauci since the AIDS pandemic. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1669.46s)]
*  And he is completely and totally marginalized [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1672.9s)]
*  and iced out of the conversation. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1676.18s)]
*  And the entire time when Fauci is out in public, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1678.26s)]
*  he's saying, I'm just following the guidance of the CDC. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1681.14s)]
*  And anyone who had inside knowledge [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1684.82s)]
*  knew that Anthony Fauci was the one who had the most [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1686.46s)]
*  influence on that guidance, and that the CDC director wasn't [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1689.14s)]
*  even in the room. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1692.74s)]
*  And if you understand American bureaucracy, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1694.26s)]
*  you know how these alphabet agencies work. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1696.62s)]
*  And it was almost strategic that his title [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1699.66s)]
*  was in such a buried organization [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1704.18s)]
*  in the middle of the stack. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1707.06s)]
*  He'd have a lot more scrutiny if he was the head of HHS, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1709.1s)]
*  but for 50 years, he's had a title [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1711.78s)]
*  in a buried alphabet organization institute [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1714.1s)]
*  within HHS under the NIH. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1717.78s)]
*  After Cheney gave him these resources, [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1722.06s)]
*  it was understood that Cheney was the most, excuse me, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1724.82s)]
*  after Cheney gave Fauci these resources, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1727.58s)]
*  it was understood in those institutes [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1730.4199999999998s)]
*  that Anthony Fauci was the most powerful person in the NIH. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1733.3s)]
*  He had a direct line to the White House. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1737.06s)]
*  He had security clearance. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1739.5s)]
*  He had a line to Congress. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1741.82s)]
*  The NIH director wasn't doing anything like that. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1744.06s)]
*  The HHS director wasn't doing anything like that. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1747.02s)]
*  Fast forward to COVID, the HHS director [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1749.94s)]
*  came in with the administration, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1752.14s)]
*  former pharmaceutical executive, Alex Azar, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1754.22s)]
*  worked for Eli Lilly. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1757.5800000000002s)]
*  And you've got Bob Redfield, who's got a lot of integrity [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1761.26s)]
*  and believed that there was a lab leak. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1764.8200000000002s)]
*  And within weeks of having conversations directly [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1767.14s)]
*  with Fauci about that, he found himself locked out of the room. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1770.02s)]
*  And it's very convenient that Fauci [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1774.94s)]
*  appeared to be this little old man who [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1779.16s)]
*  is all about helping people. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1782.0800000000002s)]
*  And he's a scientist and science first. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1783.8000000000002s)]
*  And he's a doctor even. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1786.3600000000001s)]
*  He never really cared for patients. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1788.1200000000001s)]
*  We saw in Congress one of the questions that [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1790.28s)]
*  was directed at him during his hearing was, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1794.3600000000001s)]
*  did you treat any patients during COVID? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1796.6000000000001s)]
*  Were you there? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1798.64s)]
*  Did you intubate people? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1799.28s)]
*  Did you watch them die? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1800.48s)]
*  Of course he didn't. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1802.24s)]
*  And the truth about Anthony Fauci is a lot harder to digest. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1804.24s)]
*  And I think a lot of people were onto it for years. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1813.52s)]
*  But half the country believes he's a hero still. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1816.0s)]
*  How did that happen? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1820.24s)]
*  I've interviewed a lot of documentary filmmakers. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1821.96s)]
*  I've never met one able to explain his subject matter [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1824.76s)]
*  as clearly as you are. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1827.8s)]
*  So thank you for that. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1829.1200000000001s)]
*  I just want to go back to something [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1831.2s)]
*  at the beginning you said that COVID first [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1833.1s)]
*  made an appearance outside the lab in August of 2019. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1836.82s)]
*  So there's two narratives. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1844.82s)]
*  There's the narrative that we've been given [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1846.58s)]
*  for the last four years. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1849.42s)]
*  And there's the actual fact pattern [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1851.34s)]
*  and what is the closest to the truth that we currently have. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1854.02s)]
*  And if you take it chronologically [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1858.1799999999998s)]
*  and you ignore the media that came out [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1861.58s)]
*  that announced the pandemic was happening [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1865.1s)]
*  and that the source was a wet market, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1867.26s)]
*  and you just look at the facts that even existed [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1869.74s)]
*  on American intelligence servers at the time, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1873.58s)]
*  that there is more than enough proof and evidence [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1877.74s)]
*  to show that some sort of incident happened [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1881.06s)]
*  at the Wuhan lab in either August or September. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1884.1399999999999s)]
*  There was a push to redo the HVAC system in the lab. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1888.6999999999998s)]
*  There was a transition from civilian to military control [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1893.6999999999998s)]
*  of the lab. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1897.34s)]
*  They erased their entire database of coronavirus [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1900.82s)]
*  samples of all their different collections [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1904.26s)]
*  of different coronaviruses. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1907.6599999999999s)]
*  That summer. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1909.06s)]
*  All happening in sequence, all in the early fall, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1910.94s)]
*  late summer of 2019. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1916.42s)]
*  And then in October of 2019, there [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1919.9s)]
*  is a massive Olympic style event in Wuhan [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1923.8200000000002s)]
*  where teams from around the world, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1927.54s)]
*  from armed forces from around the world, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1930.26s)]
*  like in America our Navy, our Army, the Marines, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1932.5800000000002s)]
*  sent teams to Wuhan to compete. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1936.02s)]
*  And this was an event that had been scheduled for years. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1939.06s)]
*  It was a diplomatic event using sports and athleticism [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1941.86s)]
*  to bring different countries together. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1946.3799999999999s)]
*  And at that point, Wuhan was partially shut down. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1948.98s)]
*  That there is satellite photos of overcrowded hospitals. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1953.86s)]
*  That there were drills happening at the airport that [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1958.22s)]
*  were pandemic preparedness drills. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1962.22s)]
*  And that they were called drills, but really they were, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1965.18s)]
*  I think, active response to an actual pandemic outbreak, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1967.46s)]
*  an actual leak of a virus. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1971.54s)]
*  And this intelligence all existed [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1974.46s)]
*  before the World Military Games and before we sent our armed [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1979.18s)]
*  forces to compete in this event and we allowed our allies [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1985.7s)]
*  to send their teams to compete in this event. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1989.02s)]
*  And that event in October of 2019 [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1992.3400000000001s)]
*  was the original super spreader. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1994.78s)]
*  And what people, I think, don't know about COVID, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1997.22s)]
*  but that the researchers knew about COVID, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=1999.82s)]
*  was that it was incredibly contagious. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2003.06s)]
*  And that it has up to a five day dormancy period. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2005.98s)]
*  And on top of that, a lot of people are asymptomatic. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2009.34s)]
*  So you could have an event like the World Military Games. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2013.38s)]
*  And knowing what we know about this virus now, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2017.06s)]
*  by the time the virus was reported, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2020.9s)]
*  the virus had likely spread around the world multiple times. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2023.78s)]
*  And I know we all have friends who are like, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2027.86s)]
*  well, I was sick in January and I was sicker than I've ever been. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2029.62s)]
*  People say they were sick like that in October [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2033.94s)]
*  in places like Washington in November, Washington state. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2036.26s)]
*  My wife got sick in November in Spain. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2040.18s)]
*  And so that narrative checks out. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2043.94s)]
*  And all that happens after that, leading up to the point [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2047.1399999999999s)]
*  where basically the emergency room chaos of Wuhan leaks. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2050.7s)]
*  There's a doctor who posts some stuff on WeChat. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2055.5s)]
*  And he was immediately arrested and told [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2060.7799999999997s)]
*  to erase all of his stuff off of social media, [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2067.66s)]
*  because this is the way that the Chinese government was [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2070.3799999999997s)]
*  trying to contain the story. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2073.3799999999997s)]
*  And then when it became known that he was a doctor, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2075.5s)]
*  was trying to help people, the Chinese ended up giving him an award. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2080.06s)]
*  And a month later, he died. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2084.38s)]
*  And there are a lot of other suspicious deaths in China. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2087.06s)]
*  Of COVID? [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2089.86s)]
*  Of COVID, yeah. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2090.82s)]
*  And so I hope I'm explaining this in a way that's digestible. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2093.18s)]
*  I find that when you look this in the face and you really see it, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2100.7799999999997s)]
*  you have to remember that the rest of the world [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2107.18s)]
*  hasn't had that privilege or opportunity to understand [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2109.42s)]
*  how damning the evidence is, and how ugly the story is, [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2113.02s)]
*  and how many pieces of evidence that have existed for years now. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2117.98s)]
*  What drove me to make this film, I think, and fall into it was, OK, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2125.78s)]
*  I could buy that Anthony Fauci is not honest about everything. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2131.1s)]
*  I could buy that the United States government does nefarious things [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2134.66s)]
*  and potentially was funding research they shouldn't have been funding. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2138.54s)]
*  I could buy that the pharmaceutical industry would [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2141.98s)]
*  want to cover up a story like that, because after all, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2144.18s)]
*  they were going to make billions of dollars from the countermeasure [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2147.2599999999998s)]
*  of the vaccine. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2150.02s)]
*  What struck me the most was me, as a conscious sort of anti-corruption, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2151.82s)]
*  looks reads between the lines, doesn't trust media sources, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2158.02s)]
*  had existed in this bubble where even I was not aware [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2163.02s)]
*  that there was a grant proposal to do this work two years [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2168.46s)]
*  before the pandemic happened, and that it had been reported on [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2171.38s)]
*  for two years, and I didn't even know it existed. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2174.9s)]
*  And that was the most horrifying thing for me, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2178.58s)]
*  was that I was just another sucker. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2181.34s)]
*  I'm an educated, investigative reporter of sorts who doesn't, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2184.86s)]
*  like I said, trust anything. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2190.82s)]
*  I want to dig deeper. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2192.62s)]
*  I want to go and see. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2193.5s)]
*  And then I had lived in an algorithm that completely ignored this fact, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2194.94s)]
*  and it was horrifying to me. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2203.14s)]
*  And I learned that papers that I have trusted my whole life, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2205.38s)]
*  like the New York Times and the Washington Post, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2208.34s)]
*  were in some ways the largest distributor of state-sponsored propaganda [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2211.7000000000003s)]
*  in the country, and that they were republishing studies that [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2217.34s)]
*  had no scientific merit and putting them on the front page, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2220.94s)]
*  some of them before they even hit peer review. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2224.5s)]
*  Who was feeding them those stories? [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2227.46s)]
*  And then when a writer wants to write about something that isn't a bat, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2229.9s)]
*  a pangolin, or a raccoon dog, and that is more related to an apparent [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2235.02s)]
*  cover-up and a lab leak, espionage, a bunch of things that are [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2239.94s)]
*  extremely newsworthy, those writers were told they couldn't by their editors. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2243.94s)]
*  But here I am, just a civilian like everybody else, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2249.86s)]
*  believing that the news I'm getting is the news. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2252.3s)]
*  And I want to give credit to people on the right who have broken with [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2255.2200000000003s)]
*  the mainstream media and live in a world where they feel like they need [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2260.1400000000003s)]
*  to question everything now. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2265.3s)]
*  And I felt I already lived in that world. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2266.82s)]
*  And here I was completely seduced by mistruths, misinformation, [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2270.34s)]
*  propaganda for years. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2275.7000000000003s)]
*  Maybe the biggest lie about abortion is that it's just not a big deal. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2278.0600000000004s)]
*  That's not true, and studies show it. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2281.86s)]
*  A year after having an abortion, women overall had a 50% higher chance [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2284.54s)]
*  of needing psychiatric treatment and an 87% higher likelihood of [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2288.98s)]
*  personality and behavioral disorders. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2293.3s)]
*  That's not healthcare, it's a tragedy. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2295.6200000000003s)]
*  Preborn's network clinics are different. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2298.6600000000003s)]
*  When women choose life, Preborn commits to treating them body, mind, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2300.82s)]
*  and soul as well as the future baby. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2304.86s)]
*  It's the whole picture. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2308.1800000000003s)]
*  And it's affordable. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2309.7s)]
*  An ultrasound that can save a baby's life costs $28. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2310.8199999999997s)]
*  Preborn wants to sponsor 22,000 of those by year's end. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2314.3399999999997s)]
*  It's a great investment. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2318.66s)]
*  Donating is simple, just dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2320.3399999999997s)]

*  We are proud to get behind this. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2329.54s)]
*  All gifts are tax deductible, and Preborn has a four star [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2331.18s)]
*  share to rating because they do not waste money. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2335.46s)]
*  They're totally sincere. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2338.18s)]
*  There's a lot of indications, but I'm going to reveal something that [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2339.98s)]
*  other scientists also believe that is a lot scarier. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2344.9s)]
*  And I think a lot more scary for folks that protested the vaccine, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2351.42s)]
*  didn't put it in their body and think that they're better off. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2356.58s)]
*  The virus does things like this to you. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2360.18s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2363.5s)]
*  And everyone on the planet has gotten the virus multiple times. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2363.86s)]
*  And that the virus likely has fragments from HIV in it. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2367.7000000000003s)]
*  It has fragments from other viruses. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2371.78s)]
*  It creates neurological damage. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2374.9s)]
*  It creates damage in your heart, your liver. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2377.58s)]
*  It affects every part of your body. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2380.58s)]
*  Creates autoimmune disorders that are hard to even detect. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2382.78s)]
*  They're so pervasive in people's life. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2386.54s)]
*  Little things that if you look back, you'd be like, yeah, I sneeze about this [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2388.9s)]
*  thing all of a sudden. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2393.86s)]
*  I have allergies for this that I never had. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2394.6600000000003s)]
*  Or women whose menstrual cycles changed not simply from the vaccine, but from the [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2396.46s)]
*  virus. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2401.46s)]
*  People who still have long COVID right now. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2402.54s)]
*  And long COVID is not some phenomenon that's obscure. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2405.26s)]
*  It's directly tied to the synthetic nature of the virus. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2411.06s)]
*  Did you get COVID? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2415.5s)]
*  I got COVID. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2416.46s)]
*  It felt different. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2417.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it was different. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2419.2200000000003s)]
*  And you know what's interesting is I got the first two shots. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2421.62s)]
*  And after that, I was like, I'm not boosting. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2425.62s)]
*  I'm not doing it. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2429.2999999999997s)]
*  This has gone too far now. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2429.98s)]
*  And I believed that I was an asymptomatic person. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2432.3399999999997s)]
*  And that I wasn't really going to get COVID in the first place. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2437.58s)]
*  I was going to be asymptomatic. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2440.3399999999997s)]
*  And a lot of people are asymptomatic. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2441.8199999999997s)]
*  And what's so troubling about the virus is it has such different effects for [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2445.2599999999998s)]
*  different people. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2450.74s)]
*  And so for the most part, it strikes the elderly, the immunocompromised. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2452.2599999999998s)]
*  But you could have a genetic composition that makes you die from lung complications [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2458.7s)]
*  and appear to be a healthy person. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2464.3799999999997s)]
*  You could have a genetic complication that makes you die of a sudden heart attack. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2465.66s)]
*  And even worse, you could have a genetic composition that now two years later, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2470.22s)]
*  you're learning that you have a rapid stage three or four cancer. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2474.7799999999997s)]
*  And I say that because everyone can assume or accept that the vaccine could cause that [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2479.38s)]
*  problem. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2486.1400000000003s)]
*  But we need to open up the idea that the virus itself can cause those problems. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2487.42s)]
*  That is how ugly this virus is. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2492.06s)]
*  And the type of brain fog, complicity, you know, we all got a hit over that with this [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2494.98s)]
*  virus. I don't know if you remember when you got it. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2500.1000000000004s)]
*  I experienced fatigue and brain fog like I've never experienced in my life. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2502.98s)]
*  And there's certain people who now have. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2508.18s)]
*  It's sapped your life force, your will to live, your will to live. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2510.02s)]
*  And I've been depressed one day in my entire life. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2514.7s)]
*  Fifty five years, one day of depression. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2517.66s)]
*  And it was when I had covid. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2520.3399999999997s)]
*  That's impressive. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2521.8199999999997s)]
*  I wish I had whatever you're eating for breakfast. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2523.94s)]
*  Yeah, good. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2526.8599999999997s)]
*  But I never understood what people meant when they said, I feel depressed. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2529.5s)]
*  I've been sad, of course, many times, which I think is healthy. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2533.62s)]
*  But I've never had a feeling of hopelessness or true bleak, nihilistic despair ever. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2537.98s)]
*  Not one time in my life until Thanksgiving 2020 when I had covid. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2543.7400000000002s)]
*  And I couldn't believe it. I was worried. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2549.38s)]
*  Yeah. When I got it for the first time after being vaccinated, I said, this feels completely [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2552.38s)]
*  different than any other virus I've ever had. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2560.42s)]
*  I don't get sick much. I get sick like once every two years. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2563.42s)]
*  And I was very sick. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2567.14s)]
*  And then in the middle of the night, I started having trouble breathing. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2568.7799999999997s)]
*  And I was like, wow, this is scary. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2572.34s)]
*  And this was all before I made the film. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2577.46s)]
*  This was before I got the call to if I was interested in investigating Fauci. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2579.7s)]
*  So within a couple months before making this film, I had experienced covid and really was [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2583.98s)]
*  the sickest I'd ever been from the virus. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2591.06s)]
*  And I went and I was scared. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2593.98s)]
*  So I got Pax Lovet and I ended up getting better and then getting sick again about two [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2596.86s)]
*  weeks later. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2603.54s)]
*  And it didn't really feel like a great remedy. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2604.6600000000003s)]
*  It felt more almost psychological that it's going to help me. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2607.1400000000003s)]
*  And, you know, my symptoms were reduced, but then I got sick again. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2611.26s)]
*  And then something crazy happened. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2616.46s)]
*  I'm a healthy 40 year old man and I don't have any other medical complications. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2618.34s)]
*  And I have, as I said, a very strong immune system. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2624.1800000000003s)]
*  I only get sick rarely once every couple of years. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2626.66s)]
*  I got shingles right after I had covid and took Pax Lovet. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2630.7s)]
*  And I was like, how is this possible? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2635.98s)]
*  I mean, yes, stress, all these other things, but I don't fit the sort of bill for that. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2638.5s)]
*  You're not Edie. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2646.42s)]
*  No. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2647.42s)]
*  No. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2648.42s)]
*  And I found out that two of my cousins who are the same age as me had just gotten covid [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2649.42s)]
*  and had gotten shingles. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2653.8999999999996s)]
*  And I went online and I read that a lot of young people who get covid are getting shingles [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2656.06s)]
*  after they get covid. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2661.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'm sure people listening to this are going to say, yeah, me too. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2662.82s)]
*  That's crazy. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2665.62s)]
*  It's not a coincidence. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2667.7s)]
*  This virus directly targets your immune system and does things that are hard to even compute. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2669.44s)]
*  I mean, some of them are so varied in people, they're as varied as our DNA. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2676.34s)]
*  I had had that experience right before making the movie. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2683.62s)]
*  So I was very, I think, open minded to the idea that everything I was told was not necessarily [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2685.9s)]
*  the truth. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2692.7s)]
*  Because it was engineered and because genetics play a determinative role in illness and our [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2696.8599999999997s)]
*  response to viruses and our response to everything, is it conceivable that, whether by engineering [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2701.98s)]
*  or not, that certain genetic makeups are more susceptible to illness? [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2709.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2715.3799999999997s)]
*  And I think if the Chinese were actively constructing a bio weapon, that you would look at America's [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2716.8999999999996s)]
*  general health condition and that this virus disproportionately affects people with diabetes, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2725.5s)]
*  people with heart issues. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2733.94s)]
*  We live on a very poor diet here in the United States. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2736.46s)]
*  We're one of the richest, if not the richest country in the world. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2739.66s)]
*  And the quality of food we're eating is the opposite of what we should be eating. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2743.38s)]
*  We're eating poison every day. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2750.06s)]
*  And that's effectively permitted and lobbied for and we don't regulate it. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2752.26s)]
*  And so if you look at that from an outside looking in and know that we're in such poor [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2757.82s)]
*  health, it would make sense to make a virus that targets a certain genetic composition. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2762.34s)]
*  IBMI. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2766.86s)]
*  Sure. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2767.6600000000003s)]
*  And in fact, this was documented. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2768.7000000000003s)]
*  This is there was intelligence briefs that came out, you know, after the State Department [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2771.2200000000003s)]
*  report a year after the pandemic. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2776.34s)]
*  And those intelligence reports show years of knowledge about the Chinese bio weapons [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2778.86s)]
*  program. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2783.98s)]
*  And the question is, how did we develop years of knowledge about the Chinese bio weapons [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2785.26s)]
*  program? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2790.38s)]
*  Because we were effectively funding and supplying the Chinese bio weapons program with our [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2791.34s)]
*  most talented scientists who are giving them technologies they didn't already have. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2797.54s)]
*  And the exchange was so that we could spy on them. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2803.1800000000003s)]
*  And if that isn't a completely insane proposition, I don't know what is. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2806.3s)]
*  And we knew at that point, and maybe what caused such panic and alarm was that the Chinese [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2812.1800000000003s)]
*  were experimenting with things that were very, very questionable and dangerous. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2818.34s)]
*  They had genetically engineered a human embryo so that the child was born immune to small [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2824.54s)]
* pox and polio and I believe HIV and that there were programs in place to understand [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2832.1000000000004s)]
*  the Chinese genome as it pertained to viruses to. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2839.2200000000003s)]
*  Protect against viruses that were targeting the Chinese genome. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2845.06s)]
*  And of course, if you look at the flip side of that would be to make viruses that do not [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2850.2999999999997s)]
*  target the Chinese genome. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2855.2599999999998s)]
*  And I want to remind people who make it easier when you have an ethnostage. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2858.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2861.86s)]
*  It does. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2863.14s)]
*  And, you know, I think we have to remember that we are the front runner of those technologies. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2864.14s)]
*  So whatever the Chinese are doing, they're likely sifting that technology from us. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2869.74s)]
*  And the United States is not off the hook in crazy research and Anthony Fauci was pedal [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2876.54s)]
*  to the metal on this stuff for two decades. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2882.2999999999997s)]
*  So do we know whether the virus escaped intentionally or by accident? [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2884.9399999999996s)]
*  There are some breaks right now that are happening. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2891.7799999999997s)]
*  And I think right when the new administration gets in and a lot of folks who are very concerned [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2896.22s)]
*  with this issue and passionate about exposing the truth, we're going to know a lot more [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2901.4599999999996s)]
*  really quickly. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2905.62s)]
*  But there's some really concerning stuff that was just released that DOD officials had a [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2907.3799999999997s)]
*  briefing about the potential accident and the virus in October of 2019. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2913.4199999999996s)]
*  So previously, the intelligence was labeled sort of unanalyzed, that it was just on a [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2920.98s)]
*  server and we didn't see it, which of course is extremely suspicious. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2926.58s)]
*  I mean, we can see how many nose hairs someone has from a satellite at this point. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2930.42s)]
*  I mean, the idea that we wouldn't be able to sift one of the largest, most troubling [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2936.06s)]
*  signals that you could ever see on an intelligence server and have an alert set up for it just [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2940.58s)]
*  is it's illogical. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2945.62s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2946.78s)]
*  But we now know that they actually did meet and they did discuss this incident. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2948.18s)]
*  And we also know that the DOD was very privy to a proposal to create this virus. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2954.2599999999998s)]
*  It was called the Diffuse Proposal. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2960.74s)]
*  It was submitted in 2018. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2962.7799999999997s)]
*  It's taken four years for us to learn that 15 other US agencies saw that proposal before [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2965.2999999999997s)]
*  the pandemic. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2971.2599999999998s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2973.06s)]
*  So I mean, that does improve, but it certainly suggests an intentional act. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2974.14s)]
*  It does. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2980.98s)]
*  And then the part that is also very troubling that people whose anonymity I should keep, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2982.22s)]
*  who have security clearance and who did not disclose this to me in a very explicit way, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2992.16s)]
*  who signaled that they believe this to be the case, is that American scientists using [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=2998.34s)]
*  American research dollars at American institutions and with the federal government created a [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3006.58s)]
*  proposal partnering with a Chinese scientist at the Wuhan lab, Xi Jinping, who was also [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3013.06s)]
*  a Chinese military scientist. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3022.0s)]
*  Yes, it was a military lab, effectively. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3023.7000000000003s)]
*  It was a military lab and that many of the scientists even who were coming to the United [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3025.58s)]
*  States had dual affiliation with the military program. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3029.8199999999997s)]
*  And it is believed now that the Chinese funded the Diffuse Proposal. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3034.06s)]
*  What would stop them from funding the proposal? [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3039.18s)]
*  We gave them all the technology. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3041.22s)]
*  We outlined what we were looking to do. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3042.66s)]
*  Now if you read that proposal cover to cover, you'd have to be really, I think, scientifically [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3044.98s)]
*  knowledgeable and astute to understand what they were trying to do. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3052.62s)]
*  But the reality is what they were trying to do didn't make any sense in this proposal. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3055.2999999999997s)]
*  It was already subterfuge. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3058.06s)]
*  They were trying to go and take a virus that had never been seen before from the jungle, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3060.02s)]
*  from areas like Yunnan province where these viruses can jump out of nature and cross over [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3065.8599999999997s)]
*  into humans, take them into the lab and put a fur and cleavage site into the spike protein [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3071.18s)]
*  play with this part of the virus called DC sign or this pathway, which targets our immune [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3078.7s)]
*  cells and tells us not to fight the virus until it reaches our lymph nodes and that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3084.46s)]
*  we're being infected directly in our immune system. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3088.8999999999996s)]
*  And the proposal says how to do all of this. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3092.3799999999997s)]
*  And the purpose of the proposal apparently is to see what the virus will do. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3095.18s)]
*  And that the thing that the takeaway at the end of the proposal is that that they want [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3099.46s)]
*  to make a bat vaccine and go and they want to spray it in a cave so that a virus like [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3103.7799999999997s)]
*  this doesn't come out of nature. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3107.62s)]
*  And so anyone who's really looking critically, knowing what we know now, that part seems [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3112.2s)]
*  like bullshit and that the real purpose was to create a bio weapon that was very effective [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3116.9799999999996s)]
*  or to at least continue research on the spike protein and aspects of the spike protein that [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3124.2999999999997s)]
*  hadn't been resolved yet. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3132.48s)]
*  And when I say that is that the NIAID and Fauci was funding research about fur and cleavage [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3134.56s)]
*  sites and the spike protein because all of it was relevant to the mRNA vaccine because [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3141.92s)]
*  it was the part that they hadn't really figured out yet. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3146.92s)]
*  The fur and cleavage site causes this toxic reaction and there was research into it and [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3149.8s)]
*  Ralph Baric had done research into it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3155.68s)]
*  This is stuff that predates the pandemic by years. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3158.32s)]
*  And so this proposal in many ways is probably a continuation of that type of work. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3161.7599999999998s)]
*  But the proposal was also a cookbook on how to make a really dangerous coronavirus, one [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3169.3599999999997s)]
*  that would be devilish and one that would be worse than any that had ever been seen. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3174.6s)]
*  And the logic, I guess, is we got to know what's coming and prepare for it. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3180.16s)]
*  The irony is we weren't that prepared and a lot of people died. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3184.9199999999996s)]
*  The proposal itself says that effective countermeasures for a virus like this are currently chloroquine [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3191.24s)]
*  and remdesivir. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3197.3199999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3198.3199999999997s)]
*  Yes, the proposal in 2018 acknowledges chloroquine as an effective method for treating this type [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3199.3199999999997s)]
*  of coronavirus. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3206.52s)]
*  And so you have all these different reasons why this proposal does not see the light of [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3209.3599999999997s)]
*  day for years. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3214.2s)]
*  And thank God for a Marine in DARPA who finds it on an area of that server that is not classified, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3215.9199999999996s)]
*  which makes one believe that someone in the classified area of that program wanted this [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3227.56s)]
*  to be exposed. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3234.0s)]
*  And if Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Murphy did not expose this to the public, we may have [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3235.8799999999997s)]
*  never found out that this proposal existed. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3241.16s)]
*  Mind you, 15 US agencies saw the proposal and it was pitched to them two years before [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3244.56s)]
*  the pandemic happened. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3250.2s)]
*  How do travelers stay prepared for the unexpected? [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3251.48s)]
*  Well, when you're flying across the country or driving for hours crammed into crowded [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3254.44s)]
*  spaces, and yet most people don't think what they do if they got sick or someone they love [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3258.52s)]
*  got sick. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3262.48s)]
*  Have you thought about that? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3263.48s)]
*  Well, now it's the holidays. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3264.48s)]
*  It's the busiest travel time of the year and it's also flu season. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3265.48s)]
*  Everyone's stressed. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3268.6s)]
*  People are coughing. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3269.6s)]
*  And if you're unlucky, you could find yourself ill in a place where you need medication. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3271.04s)]
*  So what do you do about that? [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3274.88s)]
*  Well, thankfully there's a solution. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3276.16s)]
*  It's called JACEGO. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3277.68s)]
*  JACE, J-A-S-E-GO. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3278.68s)]
*  It's a compact kit of essential prescription medications for all of those unexpected health [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3279.68s)]
*  emergencies. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3285.52s)]
*  For infections, food poisoning and more. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3286.7599999999998s)]
*  It's designed to go wherever you go. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3289.7999999999997s)]
*  Think about that. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3291.72s)]
*  Snow hits, pharmacies close, flights get delayed, bad things happen. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3292.72s)]
*  If you have JACEGO, you're covered. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3296.42s)]
*  There's no scrambling, no worrying. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3298.04s)]
*  You can be content because you've got peace of mind. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3300.48s)]
*  So don't wait until you're stuck without essential medications. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3302.48s)]
*  It's crucification. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3306.64s)]
*  Is there going to be an ear infection? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3307.64s)]
*  Probably. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3309.64s)]
*  So go to JACE. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3310.64s)]
*  Go to JACE.com slash go. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3311.64s)]
*  J-A-S-E dot com slash go. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3313.64s)]
*  Use the code TUCKER to get your JACEGO with a special discount. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3316.16s)]
*  JACE.com slash go code TUCKER. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3319.96s)]
*  The big question here is why would the United States be working directly with what most [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3322.84s)]
*  people assume is its main enemy, China, to create a virus that disproportionately hurts [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3331.84s)]
*  the United States and then once caught doing it, covered it up on behalf of China. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3339.4s)]
*  And that cover-up continues. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3344.76s)]
*  There are no, I mean, the economic cost alone of the United States is hard to calculate, [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3345.76s)]
*  but it's, you know, biggest ever. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3349.1600000000003s)]
*  And there's no call for reparations from China for this. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3351.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's a head-scratcher, right? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3354.88s)]
*  But if you follow the money, this was the largest transfer of wealth in modern history. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3359.5s)]
*  There was a moment in the pandemic when literally billions of dollars a second were moving from [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3365.76s)]
*  the poor to the rich. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3371.64s)]
*  And anyone under a certain income bracket, no matter how you cut it, they lost. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3374.06s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3378.36s)]
*  PPP loans. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3379.36s)]
*  Do you own a house? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3380.96s)]
*  I did at the time, yeah. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3382.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3384.0s)]
*  Most people in their 30s now, like you said, you're 40, but they're not buying houses. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3385.0s)]
*  No. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3391.1200000000003s)]
*  Like this is a renting society post-COVID. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3392.1200000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3394.28s)]
*  And... [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3395.28s)]
*  It'll completely transform the social structure of the United States forever. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3396.28s)]
*  In ways that we don't connect as fluidly as we should. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3401.04s)]
*  Right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3406.1600000000003s)]
*  There is a nexus of tech companies, virus research, pharmaceutical companies... [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3407.6s)]
*  Biotech, we call it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3415.48s)]
*  Biotech, but even straight tech. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3416.48s)]
*  Right? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3418.92s)]
*  Metabiota is also owned by Google. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3419.92s)]
*  And if you are going to have, say, an effective bioweapons attack, you're going to need to [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3424.2s)]
*  control information. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3428.44s)]
*  And what I think a lot of people don't understand is the biggest client of all of these tech [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3431.08s)]
*  companies is the United States. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3434.8399999999997s)]
*  So before you see the announcement about the microchip or the new development, the US government [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3437.28s)]
*  has likely already purchased $5-10 billion worth of the technology and had it a year [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3442.1600000000003s)]
*  before and you don't know about that. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3446.92s)]
*  And there's privileges that come with that, obviously, because you can leverage, the government [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3450.7200000000003s)]
*  can leverage tech companies, as we saw with COVID, and can access data. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3455.6400000000003s)]
*  And this is carryover from 9-11. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3460.96s)]
*  The Patriot Act, alive and well. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3463.8s)]
*  Tech companies, at that point, I think, were primitive compared to what they are now. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3465.92s)]
*  I mean, I don't even think in 2001, we understood how online we would be living our life. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3470.12s)]
*  But COVID magnified that by 10. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3476.04s)]
*  I didn't even know what Zoom was before COVID. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3479.6800000000003s)]
*  I mean, Skype was a thing and it was like, why this is OK, FaceTiming, like, sure. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3483.0s)]
*  But like, our entire society moved to a remote existence. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3488.48s)]
*  So that benefited the companies that created those technologies. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3494.56s)]
*  I mean, Zoom stock went through the roof. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3499.04s)]
*  It benefited all this entire ecosystem of data. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3502.04s)]
*  And it also really benefited the intelligence community and others who could sift data that [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3505.4399999999996s)]
*  they weren't privy to. You and I are no longer having a conversation at a coffee shop. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3511.2799999999997s)]
*  We're having one on Zoom. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3515.48s)]
*  And, you know, that's one kind of gain, small compared to the other gains. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3517.6800000000003s)]
*  Let's just look at the pharmaceutical companies. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3525.08s)]
*  Over one hundred and twenty billion dollars between all of them in the first couple years [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3527.2000000000003s)]
*  of the of the vaccines going public. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3532.92s)]
*  And the stock market, you know, it was a perfect example of the elite, which I think Fouchy [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3536.44s)]
*  really represents, and that is very common in D.C. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3543.6800000000003s)]

*  People like yourself who know D.C. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3548.3999999999996s)]
*  know that when you make it to D.C., it's a party and the people back home aren't invited. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3551.08s)]
*  It's not about you being a Democrat. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3557.4399999999996s)]
*  It's not about you being a Republican. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3559.64s)]
*  D.C. is an insular system and that it is an elite system and that the most, you know, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3561.8399999999997s)]
*  deep pocketed lobbyists and people trying to influence policy forces from outside the [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3568.9199999999996s)]
*  country, having offices there and of course, America's largest corporations, you know, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3574.84s)]
*  engaging in whatever they can to have the law favor their interests. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3582.8s)]
*  That isn't that doesn't favor any constituents. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3588.92s)]
*  That doesn't have anything to do with what people voted on. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3591.44s)]
*  And everybody's very collegial with each other. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3594.08s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of mudslinging on social media and there's a lot of mudslinging on [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3596.1600000000003s)]
*  TV. But in the halls of Congress, everybody's very collegial with each other. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3600.64s)]
*  Everyone knows the game that's being played. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3605.7999999999997s)]
*  And I think that it's an illusion. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3609.08s)]
*  In the truth of what's actually happening most of the time is policies and actions that [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3612.44s)]
*  hurt the poor, that weaken the middle class and that ingratiate and further the wealth of the [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3620.68s)]
*  wealthy. And I think that's the most important thing. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3627.56s)]
*  Maybe that's my progressive, left leaning politics coming through. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3631.0s)]
*  I don't consider myself a political being anymore. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3634.8399999999997s)]
*  I think politics itself is sinister. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3637.36s)]
*  I don't think you can be a politician in America and not be compromised in some way, because at [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3640.08s)]
*  some point you've had to ignore a truth in order to promote yourself to get to the position [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3644.96s)]
*  you're in. But that's the system we created. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3650.3199999999997s)]
*  And COVID was a microcosm of every weakness that already existed in that system. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3653.72s)]
*  And so you have the worst event that ever happened, yet our stock market was on a sugar high [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3659.4s)]
*  for years. People got rich during COVID just from their stock positions. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3664.36s)]
*  Well, who has stock positions? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3669.6400000000003s)]
*  Not the guy working at the sanitation, you know, not the teacher. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3671.44s)]
*  You know, it was great for wealthy people who, oh my God, my kids can come with me on [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3677.84s)]
*  vacation. I can just take my work call from a golf course and the nannies are covering it. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3681.76s)]
*  If you lived in East Baltimore and you were African American and you were in a school [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3688.24s)]
*  district that was struggling, you didn't even log on for two years. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3692.8s)]
*  We lost a whole generation of kids to remote learning. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3696.32s)]
*  Those schools should have never been closed. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3699.88s)]
*  And yet you brought up all these places in the country that had thank you Dr. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3702.44s)]
*  Fauci signs. Well, what do they all have in common? [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3708.16s)]
*  These are upper middle class parts of the country. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3711.48s)]
*  Poor people did not get anything from COVID. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3714.48s)]
*  And if they continue to wave the flag of who they believe their political hero is, guess [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3717.68s)]
*  what? There's no politician who's really doing much for the poor. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3723.48s)]
*  There's some talking about doing stuff for the poor. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3727.48s)]
*  But what actually trickles down to the poor is very, very small. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3730.12s)]
*  And they are getting more and more disenfranchised. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3733.88s)]
*  And when you talked about reorganizing society, that was one of the biggest takeaways. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3737.16s)]
*  They are more and more disempowered now, the poor of America than they've ever been. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3742.24s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. And there are a lot more of them than there ever have been ever in [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3746.16s)]
*  any point in our history. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3749.56s)]
*  I'm very aware of that. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3752.08s)]
*  So, so the question of why does Washington continue to cover it up might be answered [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3753.6s)]
*  just by noting because they're the beneficiaries of it and they've got something to hide. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3761.48s)]
*  So like, why would they? [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3765.7999999999997s)]
*  It's working, right? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3768.24s)]
*  It's working. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3769.16s)]
*  OK, media went up, tech went up, stock market itself went up. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3769.64s)]
*  You got an election with an incredible turnout. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3774.24s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3776.8399999999997s)]
*  I mean, what's better to get people to come to the polls than racism? [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3777.96s)]
*  You know, a vaccine they shouldn't be taking, some kind of regime change that's happening [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3784.4s)]
*  illegitimately. I mean, we have to remember that if you really take a bird's eye view of [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3789.96s)]
*  the system, it benefits both parties. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3794.7999999999997s)]
*  It's not simply like the Republicans go and do a strategy that divides people and it just [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3798.48s)]
*  benefits Republicans. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3803.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3804.48s)]
*  It's this is a self-affirming loop. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3805.2000000000003s)]
*  I agree. I mean, that's what that's what in the end the trans stuff does is it does [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3807.96s)]
*  serve both parties, actually. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3813.0s)]
*  And I think the race hatred that has been imposed on us is not organic. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3815.1600000000003s)]
*  Does the same. It's all intentional. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3821.5600000000004s)]
*  It hurts both sides, too. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3824.2000000000003s)]
*  It hurts both sides. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3826.48s)]
*  What destroys your society ultimately. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3827.68s)]
*  But it definitely distracts people from, you know, other things. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3829.56s)]
*  You know, go hate each other. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3834.16s)]
*  Leave us alone as we elude it. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3835.36s)]
*  This isn't new. This is Bacon's Rebellion. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3837.56s)]
*  This happened at the end of the 1700s. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3839.7599999999998s)]
*  It's when black and white slaves united and took over Charlestown, Virginia. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3842.2s)]
*  OK, because the British were giving them too much taxes and they wanted more protection [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3848.48s)]
*  against Native Americans. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3854.64s)]
*  It's a very ugly story. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3856.08s)]
*  They successfully took over a colony for two years and the plantation class looked at [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3858.08s)]
*  that and said, we have a serious problem right here, because if they realize who the real [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3863.36s)]
*  enemy is and who's getting rich off their backs, we're we're fucked. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3868.0s)]
*  And the whole concept of chattel slavery and three fifths of a man and white people being [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3873.44s)]
*  better than black people was perfected at that moment because it's incredibly effective [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3880.16s)]
*  at dividing the poor right down the middle. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3885.7999999999997s)]
*  And look at when Martin Luther King got assassinated. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3888.7599999999998s)]
*  He was at the point where he was focusing on wealth disparity and programs for the poor. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3891.08s)]
*  That's when he got killed, not when he said that we're all created equal. [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3896.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3901.12s)]
*  And he's not the only one who got assassinated for moving a lot of people. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3902.96s)]
*  Yeah. So I just want to touch on the public health response after the [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3906.84s)]
*  virus became universal. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3916.04s)]
*  And you talked about why you think there was relentless focus on vaccines, the exclusion [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3918.04s)]
*  of other potential remedies, medicines, but masking, you know, physical separation of [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3924.04s)]
*  people. It was super obvious right away those were not effective, but they they were [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3934.08s)]
*  policy for years after that. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3938.96s)]
*  What was that? [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3940.6s)]
*  I think that Fauci believed that whatever it is you tell the public, it should be simple [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3941.6s)]
*  and there should be no room for confusion about the mandate you're giving. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3949.48s)]
*  What that leads to is the type of behavior where you're for something one day, you're [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3954.2s)]
*  against it the next day. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3958.3199999999997s)]
*  You don't have conclusive science on boosters for children. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3960.12s)]
*  In fact, there's no science for boosters to children. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3963.3199999999997s)]
*  They should have never been recommended. [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3966.2799999999997s)]
*  They should have never been recommended. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3968.24s)]
*  And yet they decided to augment that data and just make it simple for people. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3970.36s)]
*  I mean, this is giving them the benefit of the doubt and not assuming that there is a [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3976.32s)]
*  more nefarious reason why these policies existed, that we're all about ultra vaccinating [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3979.6s)]
*  people constantly. And it was also a lie that we should have been locked down in the first [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3985.88s)]
*  place and that our schools should have been closed in the first place. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3990.08s)]
*  That was a lie. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3992.48s)]
*  So when society is at the brink and everybody is going insane in their homes and can't get [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=3994.48s)]
*  back to work, can't go to a bar, can't go to a baseball game, everything about American [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4004.0s)]
*  society has shut down. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4008.84s)]
*  The amount of leverage you have to sell a solution that is completely black and white, [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4012.04s)]
*  that this is going to do it, this is going to bring us back. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4021.0s)]
*  And anyone who doesn't do it is the enemy. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4024.76s)]
*  That is, of course, really effective. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4029.0s)]
*  It was there couldn't be anything further from the truth. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4031.6s)]
*  It didn't stop the spread. It doesn't stop you from getting covid. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4033.84s)]
*  It doesn't stop a lot of things. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4036.96s)]
*  In fact, it itself makes you sick. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4038.92s)]
*  It of itself makes you sick. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4041.16s)]
*  Do you think we're getting the outline of the public health disasters caused by the [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4044.6s)]
*  covid virus and by the lockdowns? [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4052.4s)]
*  I mean, are we getting a sense of what the consequences are? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4055.44s)]
*  I mean, let's say masking in children. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4060.92s)]
*  There's children don't really get sick from covid. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4063.7999999999997s)]
*  Sure, they spread covid. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4067.0s)]
*  But let's be honest about what covid is. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4068.52s)]
*  It's the second most infectious virus in history. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4070.6s)]
*  Everybody gets covid. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4073.8s)]
*  Some people get sick. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4075.6s)]
*  Some people don't get sick. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4077.04s)]
*  Some people get really sick. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4078.68s)]
*  Some people get moderately sick. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4080.16s)]
*  If you have a comorbidity or you're elderly, you could die. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4082.96s)]
*  Our public health policy was about protecting a small portion of the population that was [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4088.7200000000003s)]
*  at risk of death, a small population. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4095.2000000000003s)]
*  So if we're going to be honest about that, that made no sense. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4099.5599999999995s)]
*  Right. So what makes more sense is to say grandma can't get this virus. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4104.8s)]
*  So we got to protect grandma and my son who's got cancer or my aunt who's got diabetes. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4109.16s)]
*  We got to make sure that they have safe places to go and that they're contained and this [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4117.72s)]
*  vaccine should be available for them. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4122.48s)]
*  Anything trial should be available because they're at risk of dying from this really [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4124.12s)]
*  scary virus. That's assuming that you don't know anything about the virus already. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4128.6s)]
*  That's a big assumption. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4133.360000000001s)]
*  Let's go back to the news coverage. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4134.96s)]
*  Right. How many times did we hear we don't know what this is? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4136.96s)]
*  We don't know what it does. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4142.84s)]
*  You know, policies to wash surfaces and wash your fruit in the sink. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4144.92s)]
*  You know, when that had nothing to do with the way that this virus spreads. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4150.92s)]
*  Because to admit that you know what this virus does is to admit that you'd been funding it [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4154.76s)]
*  for years and that you know what the fur and cleavage site is and that you know even the way [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4160.4s)]
*  that HIV viruses interact with coronaviruses because Fauci funded a study by the same [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4164.92s)]
*  scientists who are implicated in the COVID disaster to experiment with coronaviruses as [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4171.88s)]
*  an HIV vaccine. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4179.08s)]
*  In 2014. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4180.5599999999995s)]
*  So this is a Pandora's box. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4183.16s)]
*  You open it up just a crack and it blows open and all hell breaks loose. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4185.4s)]
*  So for almost a year lies were told about this virus, not just where it came from, but [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4190.92s)]
*  how to treat it, how it was spread. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4195.839999999999s)]
*  If we were honest about lab engineering, we would have been able to stop the spread in [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4199.48s)]
*  the way that it mattered the most. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4203.879999999999s)]
*  The problem is you can't get an emergency use authorization for a vaccine if there's [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4206.52s)]
*  another useful countermeasure. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4212.320000000001s)]
*  So if you look back at the media and you start and you look at it with cynical eyes and [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4215.360000000001s)]
*  you've lost trust for Anthony Fauci at this point, like I did, and I said, OK, well, I [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4219.76s)]
*  see one lie. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4224.400000000001s)]
*  You know, it's like in a true crime when the detective, the person tells one lie and [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4225.200000000001s)]
*  they're like, OK, well, this probably the killer because now they're lying about this one [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4230.400000000001s)]
*  thing. That's the way that it felt for me. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4234.88s)]
*  It's like, how could you tell lies this big and not be lying about everything? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4238.0s)]
*  I have to assume that you're lying about everything now. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4242.0s)]
*  That's a fair assumption. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4244.0s)]
*  And so, you know, you're going to push this experimental technology that. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4245.36s)]
*  Conservatively should take about five to 10 years to test in humans before you release [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4253.2s)]
*  it to the public. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4257.68s)]
*  That's going to make certain individuals and companies billions of dollars. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4259.4800000000005s)]
*  Money, by the way, that flowed back to the NIH and to Fauci's organization, we know now [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4264.6s)]
*  six hundred and fifty million dollars funded back to that organization through royalties [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4270.4s)]
*  from the pharmaceutical companies. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4276.52s)]
*  And there is a system in place that is favoring a fixed outcome. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4278.76s)]
*  And that outcome doesn't have anything to do with public health. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4285.6s)]
*  And it doesn't really have anything to do with the most effective thing. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4288.84s)]
*  It's got to be new and it's going to benefit. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4293.64s)]
*  It's got to benefit our friends. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4295.96s)]
*  And Moderna was a great friend to the U.S. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4298.360000000001s)]
*  government. In fact, Moderna was mostly funded by the U.S. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4301.16s)]
*  government for a period of time. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4303.6s)]
*  It was never really a successful company. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4305.240000000001s)]
*  They'd been working on that cancer program with mRNA. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4308.12s)]
*  It didn't stick. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4310.72s)]
*  They were also funded by the DOD directly. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4313.16s)]
*  So it's a pharmaceutical company being funded by the DOD, the Department of Defense. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4315.96s)]
*  And ultimately, this project was a big deal for Fauci and for others. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4321.88s)]
*  And this idea of this coronavirus vaccine and the way in which it got preferential [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4329.8s)]
*  treatment in the process is obvious. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4335.08s)]
*  In fact, there was a deal to develop this vaccine before the pandemic was even [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4338.64s)]
*  announced. And people will tell you, oh, no, that's just a coincidence. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4346.08s)]
*  The information sharing agreement with Ralph Barak, the guy who was involved in the [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4350.84s)]
*  research at Wuhan and Moderna and NIH and, you know, under Fauci's influence. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4355.76s)]
*  That was just a coincidence because it says on the paper MERS vaccine, not SARS [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4361.68s)]
*  vaccine. This is the type of trickery and tomfoolery and bullshit that runs [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4366.84s)]
*  bureaucracies. You know, you've been in the system long enough, you know what to [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4375.72s)]
*  put in an email. You know what a grant proposal should have and should not have [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4380.12s)]
*  in it. And you know if you're going to do an information sharing agreement before [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4384.4s)]
*  the world is hit with the worst pandemic of a generation for a vaccine to have a [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4388.0s)]
*  front runner position that you don't want to have too many fingerprints on that. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4393.24s)]
*  So let's call it a MERS vaccine and not a SARS vaccine. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4396.84s)]
*  All that happened. All that happened. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4401.04s)]
*  And the reason why it happened is because there was knowledge that this virus was [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4403.8s)]
*  going to ravage the world months before it was reported and that it's insane to [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4407.48s)]
*  think that Anthony Fauci, a preeminent infectious disease, you know, not a [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4412.839999999999s)]
*  virologist, but someone in public health who's been studying these viruses, did [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4419.4s)]
*  not get the fucking memo that a virus was spreading all over China before [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4424.16s)]
*  December. That's hard to believe. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4428.2s)]
*  So we were at a meeting here at TCN the other day and I looked around the room and [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4430.839999999999s)]
*  every other person had a kind of ruddy vitality, pink cheeks, alertness, bright [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4434.04s)]
*  eyes, full mental acuity and a cheerfulness you could almost smell. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4442.4400000000005s)]
*  And I asked, why does everyone look so good? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4448.68s)]
*  And part of the answer, of course, is they like what we do for a living. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4452.12s)]
*  It's really interesting. We think it's important. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4455.400000000001s)]
*  But another reason everyone looks so good is because they had all had a great night [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4457.8s)]
*  sleep. I'm not making this up. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4463.88s)]
*  Almost everybody here uses a new sleep technology from a company called Eat Sleep. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4466.52s)]
*  They sent it to us and everyone here loves it. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4473.240000000001s)]
*  It's called the pod. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4476.04s)]
*  It's a high tech mattress cover effectively that you add to your existing bed. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4477.4800000000005s)]
*  You don't need a new bed or anything like that. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4481.240000000001s)]
*  You just throw this over what you have. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4483.0s)]
*  What it does is adjust the temperature of your bed, warmer or cooler, depending on [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4485.08s)]
*  what you want. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4491.0s)]
*  And it maintains an ideal sleeping environment all night long. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4492.04s)]
*  So I didn't know this, but as you progress through different phases of sleep, your [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4495.88s)]
*  body's needs change. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4499.4s)]
*  And Eat Sleep automatically keeps things exactly where they should be in the sweet spot [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4501.64s)]
*  through the entire night. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4507.08s)]
*  It's been proven to increase the quality of your sleep, the amount you sleep every night. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4509.0s)]
*  It improves your recovery time from physical exertion and it may even improve your cognitive [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4514.92s)]
*  performance and enhance your overall health. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4519.8s)]
*  It seems to be doing that in our office. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4522.76s)]
*  So it learns and adapts to your sleep patterns over time and automatically adjusts the [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4525.24s)]
*  temperatures throughout the night through each phase of sleep. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4529.24s)]
*  And it does this independently for each sleeper on either side of the bed. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4532.52s)]
*  That's pretty cool. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4538.12s)]
*  So you can sleep well and feel much better and be more effective the next morning as [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4539.56s)]
*  we are here. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4545.72s)]
*  Try it for yourself. [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4547.08s)]
*  Go to ate sleep dot com slash Tucker. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4548.2s)]
*  Use the promo code Tucker to get an extra 350 bucks off the pod for ultra. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4551.0s)]
*  You can try it with zero obligation for a month. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4556.76s)]
*  And if you don't like it, just send it back. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4558.92s)]
*  Again, that's ate sleep dot com slash Tucker. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4560.92s)]
*  Better sleep today and look great in your morning meetings as our guys do. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4564.04s)]
*  China had the World Military Games, as you said, but it also sent, you know, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4570.36s)]
*  to hundreds of thousands of its citizens around the world, including from central China, [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4577.16s)]
*  around Wuhan, including to Milan, Italy and all of Western Europe. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4582.6s)]
*  And after they knew that this pandemic had begun, that the virus is on the loose. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4587.5599999999995s)]
*  How do you explain that? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4593.32s)]
*  Well, it's interesting because there is this theory that Anthony Fauci, a man with so much [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4595.0s)]
*  knowledge, understood that in the wrong hands, this disaster could be World War Three. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4602.04s)]
*  And that the reason why he covered it up was to prevent Trump from, you know, starting World War [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4607.4s)]
*  Three and making a declaration of war because of the actions of the Chinese. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4613.08s)]
*  Yeah, that plays well. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4619.16s)]
*  But I think that there's a much harder pill to swallow and that we covered it up because [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4620.92s)]
*  we were part of it. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4627.799999999999s)]
*  And what we did in the shadows that hasn't been reported yet, who knows how ugly that is. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4628.68s)]
*  And that's our government. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4635.4800000000005s)]
*  China is going to be China. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4637.4800000000005s)]
*  China is going to do what China does. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4638.76s)]
*  China is, for the most part, our enemy in the United States. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4640.84s)]
*  I don't consider them my enemy because I'm not a government. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4645.8s)]
*  I'm a citizen. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4648.68s)]
*  And I think that all governments potentially can be abusive. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4649.8s)]
*  Apparently. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4654.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah, my government is abusive. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4655.08s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4656.84s)]
*  So if people don't have civil liberties in China, if people can't report on things and [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4657.32s)]
*  they're censored on China, if the citizens are, you know, neglected and abused and manipulated [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4661.88s)]
*  in China, I have a logical explanation for that. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4671.24s)]
*  China is going to be China. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4677.0s)]
*  The part that I refuse to accept is that, you know, the great experiment of democracy, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4678.599999999999s)]
*  the sort of the leader of thought on the planet, the guardian of truth and democracy and, you [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4685.0s)]
*  know, the best system did the exact same thing and pretended like they were the good guy. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4691.5599999999995s)]
*  So I don't understand. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4698.599999999999s)]
*  I know he keeps beginning every sentence that I don't understand. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4701.0s)]
*  But I don't understand either. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4703.16s)]
*  Well, after five years, like where are the people, where are the courageous people in [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4705.639999999999s)]
*  the media or the Congress or the executive branch? [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4709.32s)]
*  Where are the courageous physicians, the researchers, the NIH? [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4712.599999999999s)]
*  They're all in the movie. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4717.4s)]
*  And that's what's so interesting is that if you look at this movie, there aren't that [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4718.76s)]
*  many then. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4722.76s)]
*  There aren't that many, sadly, but there are many that aren't in the movie. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4723.72s)]
*  But I think a phenomenon happened that I joined this party at a point of real, I think, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4727.72s)]
*  apathy, even for the people that fought so hard to expose the truth, because by that [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4737.0s)]
*  point there had been a grant proposal that got released to the public. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4743.4s)]
*  There had been all these damning emails to Fauci. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4746.5199999999995s)]
*  There had been all this and still no wide scale awareness. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4748.92s)]
*  And what's interesting is that's when I started making the film and in a way what [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4754.28s)]
*  feels like the bottom of this story is that all of this exists and no one's doing anything [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4758.12s)]
*  about it. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4762.5199999999995s)]
*  And for many people who are not really in love with Donald Trump's policies or find [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4763.8s)]
*  other aspects of that base hard to swallow, they feel this great hope now. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4771.72s)]
*  And three people in our film are going to be in prominent positions that are historic, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4778.04s)]
*  the nominations for these positions. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4788.28s)]
*  Jay Bhattacharya is going to run the NIH. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4790.92s)]
*  Wonderful man. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4794.84s)]
*  He's been smeared and maligned. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4795.8s)]
*  He's a wonderful scientist and virologist. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4797.96s)]
*  And he's a decent human being. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4800.36s)]
*  A very decent human being and someone who cares about helping people. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4801.96s)]
*  Yes, I totally agree. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4805.56s)]
*  He does not have any pharmaceutical underwriting. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4806.36s)]
*  He's got no weird agenda. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4808.6s)]
*  I totally agree. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4809.88s)]
*  No weird agenda. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4810.04s)]
*  Marty McCurry in the movie. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4811.32s)]
*  Marty McCurry is a wonderful doctor who did whatever he could to challenge some of the [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4814.76s)]
*  subjective medicine that was happening during COVID. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4822.12s)]
*  He believed in herd immunity. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4825.24s)]
*  He believed in a lot of things that were unpopular. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4827.08s)]
*  But the truth is that when he said the pandemic was going to spread all around the world back [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4831.24s)]
*  in January, he actually was not loved by Republicans and they called him an alarmist. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4835.72s)]
*  I remember. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4840.44s)]
*  A lot of things. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4841.48s)]
*  So let's just realize that who appears to be a hero in one political party was an enemy [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4842.04s)]
*  a day before. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4848.92s)]
*  I'm that person now. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4850.28s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the rest of my movies, I'm someone who would be labeled an enemy of [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4851.32s)]
*  the state for someone on the right. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4857.5599999999995s)]
*  The truth is that the truth actually matters and that if you look beyond politics, [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4860.04s)]
*  we need to unite around these things. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4866.92s)]
*  The film is a coalition of people, including Jeffrey Sachs, who was on this show and is a [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4869.16s)]
*  wonderful thinker and someone who is clearly on the left. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4877.400000000001s)]
*  Sam Husseini is a Palestinian-American journalist who's been kicked out of a lot of press rooms, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4882.52s)]
*  who is extremely outspoken about what's happening in Israel and is obviously dismayed [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4888.28s)]
*  by what's happening in Gaza. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4897.24s)]
*  And it goes against caste, right? [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4900.28s)]
*  That all of these people agree that COVID was completely and totally an inside job, [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4902.76s)]
*  a lab accident that Anthony Fauci is, you know, for lack of a better word, pure evil. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4909.08s)]
*  And, you know, that's what's needed now. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4916.36s)]
*  And what's incredibly refreshing is many of these voices are now in nominations for huge [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4919.24s)]
*  posts that have been compromised for decades. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4927.24s)]
*  The NIH has been compromised for decades. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4930.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, at least as long since 9-11, but potentially longer. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4933.8s)]
*  And the FDA, I mean, that's been compromised for a long time now. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4939.32s)]
*  And there's also other people. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4944.2s)]
*  I mean, I was given permission to say this, but Andrew Hoff, who's in our film, [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4947.08s)]
*  is undersecretary to RFK. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4952.2s)]
*  You've got a guy who was a firsthand witness to the spying of a US-funded nonprofit on a Chinese [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4955.4800000000005s)]
*  lab and who worked for Peter Daschek's nonprofit, who was then harassed for years and called a [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4964.280000000001s)]
*  lunatic and a lot of different things. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4970.84s)]
*  And the truth is that he knew what he was talking about, and he's now in a position [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4973.96s)]
*  to use his knowledge of technology and use his knowledge of epidemiology to monitor pandemic [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4979.4s)]
*  threats. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4986.28s)]
*  And I mean all pandemic threats, not the ones that just come from nature. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4986.92s)]
*  We actually have people in positions right now. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4993.799999999999s)]
*  What RFK is going to do for anyone who understands the extent to which companies are poisoning [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=4995.88s)]
*  American citizens with the permission of the American government, literally, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5004.04s)]
*  half of the things in a supermarket aisle are not good for you. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5008.84s)]
*  And when you go to Europe, they're illegal. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5012.2s)]
*  Or you go to Japan or another country, they're illegal. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5014.92s)]
*  Russia, illegal. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5018.44s)]
*  But here in the United States, they're not. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5020.759999999999s)]
*  And the amount of health complications that exist from these products [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5024.36s)]
*  fuel the other part of the industry, which is perpetual sickness. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5028.36s)]
*  And COVID, whether designed to do this or not, creates perpetual sickness. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5032.599999999999s)]
*  And one of the most frightening things is that this calamity is not behind us. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5038.36s)]
*  In fact, the media wants you to believe that it's behind you. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5045.16s)]
*  They believe through their data, they claim, that people are over COVID. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5048.12s)]
*  They don't want to talk about it anymore. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5051.5599999999995s)]
*  How can we be over something that's still augmenting our genes right now? [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5053.5599999999995s)]
*  It still has a panoply of reactions, including turbo cancers, even if you just got the virus [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5056.759999999999s)]
*  and weren't vaccinated. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5064.04s)]
*  How can we be over that? [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5064.84s)]
*  And how can we be over the fact that when we lied about it originally, [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5066.44s)]
*  when it was lied about and the media didn't cover it, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5069.719999999999s)]
*  that more funding for this research happened? [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5073.24s)]
*  There are more labs doing gain-of-function research right now. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5076.04s)]
*  And one of the most frightening things that concerns me, [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5079.5599999999995s)]
*  and I believe is absolutely urgent right now, [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5082.28s)]
*  is that for the last six months, we all have seen reports about bird flu coming over naturally [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5085.08s)]
*  from cow milk, from a cat. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5090.92s)]
*  There was a farm worker who got it. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5093.5599999999995s)]
*  And call me a cynical person. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5095.8s)]
*  The threat of bird flu, lab-generated bird flu, has existed since the study that Anthony Fauci [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5099.8s)]
*  conducted, funded with Ron Fouchier and Kara Oka for 10 years. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5107.0s)]
*  People have feared a bird flu coming out of the lab for 10 years. [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5116.12s)]
*  The wet market proved that you got to be a little bit sharper [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5120.04s)]
*  at a story of it coming from nature. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5123.320000000001s)]
*  For six months now, we've seen story after story, isolated crossover. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5125.5599999999995s)]
*  And it's not just from one source. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5131.24s)]
*  It's coming from milk. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5132.839999999999s)]
*  It's coming from a cat. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5134.04s)]
*  To me, this is them sharpening the tool because it is absolutely inevitable [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5136.44s)]
*  that a bird flu will cross over into humans and it won't be natural. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5141.639999999999s)]
*  And the one we're going to be infected with is not going to be the one that infected the cat [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5145.639999999999s)]
*  or the cow milk. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5149.0s)]
*  It's going to be from a lab. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5150.2s)]
*  And do we have any sense of what the effect will be? [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5152.04s)]
*  COVID changed everything about the world. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5155.48s)]
*  And the fatality is like 1% to 3% max for a virus like COVID. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5160.5199999999995s)]
*  For a lot, some people would argue it's under 1%. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5166.5199999999995s)]
*  Bird flu is like straight down the middle. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5171.24s)]
*  Doesn't matter if you're a kid or an elderly person. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5175.0s)]
*  You're starting in ranges of like 10% to 50%. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5178.599999999999s)]
*  Mortality? [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5183.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5184.04s)]
*  Bird flu is way more lethal than COVID. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5185.48s)]
*  Bird flu, when Fauci funded these studies and scientists were debating the work at conventions, [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5189.799999999999s)]
*  there's a scene of it in the movie. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5197.16s)]
*  A journalist says, I thought this was a doomsday virus. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5199.08s)]
*  Why are we doing this work? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5202.599999999999s)]
*  It is a doomsday virus. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5204.92s)]
*  And keep in mind all of the transitions and shifts in power that occurred for a virus [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5207.4s)]
*  that was not a doomsday virus. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5213.48s)]
*  What happens when there is a doomsday virus? [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5215.48s)]
*  Who's going to benefit? [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5218.28s)]
*  Who's going to lose? [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5219.5599999999995s)]
*  How much power is going to shift from an event like that? [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5220.759999999999s)]
*  And you've got a situation now where all the people I just mentioned [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5223.24s)]
*  are going to destabilize the FDA, going to destabilize the NIH, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5226.679999999999s)]
*  going to declassify all of the information that would prove a story that's incredibly [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5230.92s)]
*  damning for a lot of people, including pharmaceutical companies, nation states. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5236.12s)]
*  You've got Donald Trump, who's not liked by a lot of the establishment and these [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5241.56s)]
*  bureaucracies that thrive on being insulated in some ways more powerful than the president [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5245.88s)]
*  of the United States, some of the bureaucracies. [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5252.68s)]
*  And that's been proven through history multiple times. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5255.0s)]
*  It seems like it would be a really great time for a distraction. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5258.68s)]
*  And the risk is that we are going to suffer from another manmade pandemic [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5263.0s)]
*  before we figured out who's responsible for the last one. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5268.36s)]
*  And it's going to hurt us so much that we won't even care. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5271.32s)]
*  And that's coming. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5275.799999999999s)]
*  That's why this is urgent. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5278.36s)]
*  That's why I have no issue partnering with anyone who wants to do activism around this issue. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5279.48s)]
*  If we thought nuclear disarmament was a core issue threatening the human race, [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5286.599999999999s)]
*  this type of work is in multiples of hundreds as far as the rest. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5294.12s)]
*  Why were there bio labs in Ukraine? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5298.12s)]
*  I think that the whole Ukraine thing is really fascinating. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5300.68s)]
*  We know that, by the way. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5307.72s)]
*  It's not a conspiracy theory. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5308.44s)]
*  I mean, the Undersecretary of State announced it in the Senate. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5309.64s)]
*  Yes, totally. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5312.44s)]
*  And MetaBiota and the connections to Hunter Biden. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5313.96s)]
*  MetaBiota is very much connected to the research, including things like the defuse [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5316.599999999999s)]
*  proposal, including Peter Daschk, who's like an evil scientist slash spy, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5321.32s)]
*  who's potentially not just spying for the US, but spying for the Chinese Communist Party [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5326.92s)]
*  and working as a double agent. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5332.2s)]
*  I mean, why are all these things, why are they all in the same bucket? [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5333.719999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5339.639999999999s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5340.12s)]
*  It'd be like, oh wait. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5341.16s)]
*  But why would you have bio labs in a war zone? [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5342.28s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5344.839999999999s)]
*  Perfect place to have them, right? [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5345.4s)]
*  No one's looking. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5347.5599999999995s)]
*  There's no regulation. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5349.08s)]
*  You can do whatever you want there. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5350.759999999999s)]
*  In fact, a lot of the work we were offshoring in China served the same purpose. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5353.16s)]
*  Their regulations are weak. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5358.44s)]
*  Well, that tells you everything right there. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5359.88s)]
*  I mean, if I'm looking for a place to construct a bio lab, I'm thinking, I don't know, Geneva. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5361.4s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5366.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm not thinking the poorest country in Europe, the most corrupt country in Europe, Ukraine. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5367.4s)]
*  I mean, why would you do that? [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5371.16s)]
*  Because they're the most capable scientists, are they or not? [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5372.599999999999s)]
*  A lot can happen in the cloak of chaos and war. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5376.28s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5379.24s)]
*  We know that from history. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5380.92s)]
*  I mean, things happen in war zones. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5382.12s)]
*  So just that specific question Toria Newell announces. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5384.36s)]
*  We've got bio labs in Ukraine. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5387.96s)]
*  What? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5389.639999999999s)]
*  A few people I noticed, I did a segment on it, immediately attacked by CNN, conspiracy theorists. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5392.36s)]
*  I don't want to single out CNN, but I think when we look 10 years from now, if we're still here, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5398.36s)]
*  we'll see that the pandemic was kind of the high point, the apogee of their power. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5404.599999999999s)]
*  Maybe the last moment CNN could actually have an effect on the country. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5409.72s)]
*  They had so much power. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5415.16s)]
*  And time and again, it was not an accident. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5417.16s)]
*  They were saying things they knew weren't true, but that were consistent with the [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5419.8s)]
*  storyline from people like Fauci. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5424.2s)]
*  What was that? [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5426.52s)]
*  I mean, in all fairness, let's be real. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5427.400000000001s)]
*  Your former employer used to do the same thing for years. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5429.72s)]
*  I almost got fired over it. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5432.2s)]
*  Oh yeah, they were mad at me. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5433.4800000000005s)]
*  So let's not, no one is singled out in the corrupt nature of mainstream media. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5434.44s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5440.5199999999995s)]
*  Because it's about ratings. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5441.48s)]
*  Because Roger Ailes' brilliant idea to make opinion-based news killed the Walter Cronkite approach. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5443.0s)]
*  Maybe. I worked at CNN before Fox started and it was the same idea. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5451.16s)]
*  I mean, that's a complicated question. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5457.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, every one of them has a cancer from MSNBC. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5459.879999999999s)]
*  They had Fauci on and celebrated his book. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5463.48s)]
*  He was on Maddow. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5467.08s)]
*  He was on all these people. [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5468.12s)]
*  And look, I know for a fact that Rachel Maddow is a very intelligent person. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5469.0s)]
*  And I think she may mean well. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5473.32s)]
*  I know Joy Reid. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5475.5599999999995s)]
*  Joy Reid was in one of my films. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5476.599999999999s)]
*  She's an intelligent person and she means well. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5478.44s)]
*  The industry that they are in is driven by this kind of insanity. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5481.32s)]
*  And it's a miracle that you made it out, honestly. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5488.44s)]
*  Well, I was fired, but... [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5490.759999999999s)]
*  It's a blessing you were fired. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5493.0s)]
*  Oh, I agree. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5494.12s)]
*  But no, my question is not like, are they good people or not? [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5494.92s)]
*  I mean, obviously I know them. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5498.04s)]
*  I spent my life there. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5498.92s)]
*  But the question is like, what are the mechanisms that the government uses to control media coverage? [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5499.88s)]
*  That's an interesting question. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5508.12s)]
*  How far up the ladder do we want to go? [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5510.68s)]
*  Do we want to let it be the government controlling media companies? [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5512.76s)]
*  Or do we want to admit that the government has suffered from complete agency capture [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5516.28s)]
*  in every division of the government and that veiled interests like pharmaceutical companies [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5521.56s)]
*  or the military industrial complex companies, for-profit corporations, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5527.400000000001s)]
*  influence the government more than its voters, more than its politicians. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5533.240000000001s)]
*  Right, so we're getting back to where you started, which was by saying, I thought astutely, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5536.76s)]
*  that what you're looking at are powers bigger than nation states, more powerful than nation states. [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5540.92s)]
*  When you say agency capture, it's not just in the strict sense of a federal agency, it's agency, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5546.76s)]
*  which is to say the freedom to do what you want, agency, like human agency. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5551.16s)]
*  Sure. [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5555.88s)]
*  The government doesn't have agency, actually, because it's subject to powers bigger than itself. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5556.2s)]
*  Correct. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5561.16s)]
*  I've been dying to do this, but the deep state was ours first. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5564.2s)]
*  I mean, the concept of a deep state was a leftist concept of agency capture and things like this. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5567.72s)]
*  We could argue that. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5575.5599999999995s)]
*  I still don't use that. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5576.68s)]
*  I still don't. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5577.32s)]
*  It's a buzz. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5578.36s)]
*  It's a dog whistle. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5578.84s)]
*  I agree, and I hate using it because I feel like a freaking wacko because I lived in DC for so long, [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5579.8s)]
*  family worked for the government, and I just always scoffed at people who use that term. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5586.28s)]
*  But of course, it's completely real. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5591.8s)]
*  It works well. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5593.0s)]
*  They were right, and some of the people I disliked most, I'll just say it, they were right about that. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5593.72s)]
*  They were. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5598.28s)]
*  And mainstream media, same thing, dog whistle. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5599.0s)]
*  You hear that on the left, you're like, oh, I'm done talking to you. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5601.96s)]
*  Mainstream media, whatever, guy. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5605.4800000000005s)]
*  Go back to your conspiracy theorist. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5608.360000000001s)]
*  Bolshevik, communists, terrorists, conspiracy theorists. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5611.8s)]
*  Notice the trend? [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5617.88s)]
*  These deep state mainstream media, people who devise strategies for capturing [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5620.68s)]
*  the population this way aren't dumb. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5627.8s)]
*  As a species, we need it to be simple. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5631.320000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5633.4s)]
*  And we are currently being divided by simple concepts like that, even though the truth [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5634.5199999999995s)]
*  behind them is very real. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5639.24s)]
*  We do have a problem with mainstream media being completely captured. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5641.799999999999s)]
*  And you asked, how does it happen? [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5646.599999999999s)]
*  Why is it that there are wall to wall ads for medicines? [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5650.04s)]
*  Do you think anyone sitting at home saying, you know, honey, I want to talk to the doctor [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5655.96s)]
*  about a prescription for Rex Luby or whatever? [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5661.56s)]
*  Rebellsis. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5664.68s)]
*  Yeah, Rebellsis or, you know, I can't even, they're so absurd. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5665.56s)]
*  The names, they've run out of names, they're so absurd now. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5671.400000000001s)]
*  What is that? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5674.68s)]
*  So it's funny. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5676.04s)]
*  I mean, I started in cable TV in 1995, that's 30 years. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5676.68s)]
*  And it was only in the last couple of years, I think it was Bobby Kennedy or someone who's [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5681.320000000001s)]
*  thought about it more than I had said to me this exact thing. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5685.72s)]
*  The point is not, and I wondered like, who's buying this? [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5689.0s)]
*  Who's asking his doctor for Rebellsis? [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5691.64s)]
*  Nobody. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5694.04s)]
*  The point is to control the news organization. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5694.84s)]
*  Correct. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5697.56s)]
*  Right. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5698.12s)]
*  It's not a consumer play. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5698.28s)]
*  No. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5699.72s)]
*  Right. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5700.36s)]
*  I didn't understand that. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5700.6s)]
*  I was too close to it. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5701.88s)]
*  These- [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5702.92s)]
*  But that's true. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5703.32s)]
*  Large media organizations considered to be the last line of defense, the free press in [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5705.88s)]
*  the United States, the fourth estate are completely captured. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5711.4s)]
*  Of course. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5715.56s)]
*  The same way the FDA is captured, the same way the NIH was captured, they're captured. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5715.88s)]
*  And they're drunk off the teat of the people who are paying for ads. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5721.32s)]
*  And if someone's going to pay for that many ads and you lost that ad revenue overnight, [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5727.400000000001s)]
*  that's an incredible bargaining chip. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5731.88s)]
*  You probably shouldn't cover that. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5734.84s)]
*  No, that's it. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5736.28s)]
*  It's your stock price. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5736.76s)]
*  There's no doubt. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5737.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, that's a real thing. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5738.04s)]
*  No, I ran up against it. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5741.64s)]
*  I didn't understand it at the time. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5743.4800000000005s)]
*  The problem with hosting a nightly show is it doesn't leave you a lot of time for reflection [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5745.5599999999995s)]
*  outside of your area. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5751.0s)]
*  So you pick a topic in the morning and then you spend all day thinking about it. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5752.2s)]
*  Presumably you've thought about it before, but you're thinking about your script and [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5756.12s)]
*  what to write. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5759.4s)]
*  But it's just hard to see the context for anything, of course. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5760.92s)]
*  Right? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5763.88s)]
*  You're distracted. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5764.44s)]
*  It's an art form, honestly. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5766.04s)]
*  I really respect and appreciate the people who are running daily programs like that and [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5767.4s)]
*  offering to their viewers a take. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5773.4s)]
*  And I get the privilege to spend, I do it faster than most, but I spend about 8 to 12 [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5776.599999999999s)]
*  months, sometimes 14 or 16, living in a story. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5782.5199999999995s)]
*  And living in this story for that long and looking at the data and the evidence for that [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5787.48s)]
*  long, I've lost a lot of sleep. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5791.719999999999s)]
*  I bet. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5794.28s)]
*  I've lost a lot of sleep. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5795.24s)]
*  I've lost a lot of hope. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5796.36s)]
*  And I think that people often ask, well, what are we going to do now? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5798.04s)]
*  So then what should we do? [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5800.92s)]
*  Should there be laws? [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5802.28s)]
*  Yeah, there's got to be laws. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5804.36s)]
*  There's got to be all sorts of things. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5806.36s)]
*  There's got to be an urgent intervention right now to stop the lab work that's happening [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5807.5599999999995s)]
*  that could cause another pandemic. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5811.96s)]
*  But in a way, you can't turn a battleship in the middle of the ocean. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5813.96s)]
*  It doesn't do a U-turn. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5818.92s)]
*  I mean, there's a lot going on right now that needs to be dismantled. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5820.12s)]
*  And like I said, what is crazy is that four years ago, under the indoctrination, under [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5824.5199999999995s)]
*  the sort of way that I had lived my life, I would look at a Donald Trump victory and [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5830.92s)]
*  I'd say this is a disaster. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5836.12s)]
*  This is the way liberals who are drunk off MSNBC, they think the world is ending. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5840.6s)]
*  It's a great consumer to have. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5846.04s)]
*  When a consumer thinks the world is ending, they actually spend really freely. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5847.24s)]
*  We can get into that in another episode. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5851.24s)]
*  But the way fear really affects people. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5853.56s)]
*  This constant fear of the people that are actually most afraid of Donald Trump, a lot [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5856.599999999999s)]
*  of them are extremely powerful folks running bureaucracies who have been able to control [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5862.92s)]
*  the system for a period of time. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5869.08s)]
*  A lot of them are Republican senators, actually. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5871.0s)]
*  Correct. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5872.76s)]
*  And chairman of Intel committees. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5874.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5876.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5876.92s)]
*  And that's this other side to the story. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5877.32s)]
*  And it was really heartbreaking for me to have these affiliations over the years and [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5881.32s)]
*  then to see this affiliation that I had identified with. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5889.32s)]
*  And mind you, I'm not a political person. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5893.32s)]
*  I see fraud in all politics. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5895.0s)]
*  But to see that who I believed was out there to help the poor and provide services and [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5897.8s)]
*  believe all these different things about equality and these buzzwords. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5904.68s)]
*  Was the elite. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5911.32s)]
*  And by the time we've gotten to Joe Biden, the party represents the elite now. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5913.08s)]
*  It's not doing anything for the working class. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5920.36s)]
*  It's not doing anything for the poor. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5922.92s)]
*  It's not protecting the people that I think should be protected. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5924.2s)]
*  And maybe I'm biased because I've lived in cities most of my life, but there are some [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5927.5599999999995s)]
*  services that are needed. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5931.64s)]
*  And of course, there's corruption in every service. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5932.76s)]
*  I don't have an answer. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5934.6s)]
*  And the truth is that a lot of these politicians, they don't have an answer either. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5935.96s)]
*  But they'll tell you what you want in order to get there. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5940.6s)]
*  And when they get there, it's a whole different type of question. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5944.280000000001s)]
*  Well, you got to believe in our business. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5947.88s)]
*  You've got to really sincerely believe that saying the truth out loud is a necessary step, [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5950.200000000001s)]
*  whether or not it solves the problem. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5955.88s)]
*  But without that, you definitely can't solve any problems. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5957.160000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of spiritual people who think that just saying the truth is a divine act. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5959.8s)]
*  We have to be willing to say the truth. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5964.360000000001s)]
*  People are afraid to say that is a core precept to both Judy [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5967.0s)]
* ism and Christianity. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5970.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5971.64s)]
*  In the beginning was the word. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5971.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5973.320000000001s)]
*  And no, that's absolutely right. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5973.88s)]
*  And I personally believe that because I mean, I know it. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5975.96s)]
*  But just in a political context, just on a policy level, you can't fix a problem until [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5980.200000000001s)]
*  someone stands up and says, actually, here's what it is. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5985.88s)]
*  So I'm dismayed by all the different signals that exist that, sadly, [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=5989.160000000001s)]
*  it's not possible anymore. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6001.400000000001s)]
*  And as much as I want to believe it is on a political level, that if we're not on a [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6003.320000000001s)]
*  search and destroy on those bureaucratic levels and those sort of all those agency capture [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6010.040000000001s)]
*  moments, and that we're not just putting crazy people in management positions. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6017.0s)]
*  And I can tell you, it is crazy for me to see the individuals who I know [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6022.52s)]
*  and who I've sat with and who I know that they have integrity be called crazy, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6030.28s)]
*  wacko, fringe, idiots. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6034.5199999999995s)]
*  They're going to, whatever. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6038.28s)]
*  And so I think that that's the real reform is until you clear out that rot. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6041.4s)]
*  And we were talking about pharmaceutical companies having the lion's share of ad revenue [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6047.32s)]
*  across the entire sector. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6052.839999999999s)]
*  Until you make it illegal for pharmaceutical companies to advertise in the United States, [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6055.400000000001s)]
*  same way tobacco companies can't advertise on television. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6061.0s)]
*  They're relegated to magazines and they can't even have billboards in a lot of places. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6065.16s)]
*  Pharmaceutical companies should be way worse. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6070.6s)]
*  Their products are more dangerous. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6074.6s)]
*  I'd much rather have my kids use tobacco than SSRIs. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6075.64s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6078.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's true. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6079.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6080.360000000001s)]
*  So last question, what, you've alluded to this a couple of times, but like what [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6081.16s)]
*  effect has this had on your life? [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6085.72s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like I said, lost a lot of sleep. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6089.16s)]
*  I mean, like anyone else, COVID- [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6093.72s)]
*  Did you lose friends? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6095.08s)]
*  You know, what's interesting is I didn't. [[01:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6097.08s)]
*  Because when I could finally get through to people and I had their attention, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6100.2s)]
*  I saw the transition happen in them. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6105.639999999999s)]
*  And I think what's interesting is like, if you look at a zombie movie or you look at, [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6108.04s)]
*  you know, a piece of science fiction, there's always a hack, right? [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6113.72s)]
*  There's a hack to the mind control. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6117.56s)]
*  There's a hack to the sickness that people are suffering from the thing that's turning [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6120.2s)]
*  them against each other. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6124.76s)]
*  And I think that one of the most sinister things about COVID is we lost the ability [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6126.6s)]
*  to sit in the same room, to look someone in the eye, to have a conversation. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6131.8s)]
*  And even before COVID, even by the time we got to the 2016 election, maybe before that, [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6136.04s)]
*  we lacked the ability to have conversations across different ideological means. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6142.5199999999995s)]
*  But the fact remains that if you have a logical conversation with someone about an issue, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6148.44s)]
*  that's really where our humanity comes through. [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6155.48s)]
*  And all of the different platforms that we're living off of, that we're addicted to, [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6158.839999999999s)]
*  social media, you know, regular mainstream media, it's designed to actually take us out of that [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6162.76s)]
*  humanity and to make us mechanical in the way that we live our life. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6169.72s)]
*  And the more mechanical we are, the less willing we are to say, oh, wow, that's interesting. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6173.64s)]
*  I feel that in my heart. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6179.16s)]
*  And I truly believe I will make this challenge to anyone who considers themselves a liberal, [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6180.68s)]
*  a Democrat who feels heartbroken about this last election. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6187.24s)]
*  That if you can make it 10 minutes into this film, you will never feel the same way ever again. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6191.5599999999995s)]
*  And I believe that it's not because I'm a great filmmaker. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6197.96s)]
*  It's not because, you know, it's special. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6201.4s)]
*  It's because the information has been so disparate, purposefully, that you can't connect it in one sitting. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6204.5199999999995s)]
*  And what the film does is it allows you to connect 75 years of scientific arrogance, [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6212.04s)]
*  of government disasters, all in one place and realize they're all connected. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6218.2s)]
*  And that has been deprived of the public for decades now, a lot of it because of cable news, [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6225.32s)]
*  because there isn't enough time to connect it all. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6230.76s)]
*  Well, that is true, man. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6233.4s)]
*  That is the truest. [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6234.84s)]
*  And so I could sit here with you and despite, you know, seeing you on the air and maybe you had [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6236.6s)]
*  opinions that weren't my own, you're a human being. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6241.96s)]
*  We're sitting here. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6244.92s)]
*  We're having a conversation. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6245.64s)]
*  I don't care who you voted for because we're talking about the truth now. [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6247.24s)]
*  And we need to have that conversation because everyone is at risk right now. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6251.8s)]
*  This is not a political issue. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6257.4s)]
*  Everyone, not just in America, is at risk. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6259.0s)]
*  Everyone on the planet is at risk right now. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6261.32s)]
*  And if it can benefit certain people so enormously, whether it was an accident or intentional, [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6264.5199999999995s)]
*  and if so much power can be transferred from an event like this, it's going to happen again. [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6272.68s)]
*  That's right. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6277.400000000001s)]
*  And that's why I made the film. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6278.52s)]
*  And that's why I'm willing to work with anyone who's passionate about stopping this from [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6280.200000000001s)]
*  happening again, about holding people like Anthony Fauci accountable, about, you know, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6285.400000000001s)]
*  getting rid of the rot in these agencies that are meant to protect people. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6290.68s)]
*  Since when are we not about consumer protections anymore? [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6295.400000000001s)]
*  Remember that part of the United States when people were trying to protect [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6297.96s)]
*  constituents? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6302.52s)]
*  It's the opposite. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6303.32s)]
*  We're selling, effectively selling, American citizens downriver to abusive and somewhat [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6304.12s)]
*  murderous forces that have captured our government. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6312.6s)]
*  And believe me, they're not Donald Trump. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6316.6s)]
*  They're big agro. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6319.0s)]
*  They're big pharma. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6319.88s)]
*  They're things that poison us every day. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6321.08s)]
*  There's connective tissue to these stories, like in the movie, that if you sat and you [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6323.400000000001s)]
*  experienced it in one place, you would never look at the world ever again the same way. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6327.72s)]
*  And all I hope is that it can break through enough to do that. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6332.360000000001s)]
*  And I thank you for having me on to discuss it, you know? [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6335.08s)]
*  It's an amazing, amazing two hours. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6339.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6341.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6342.280000000001s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6347.400000000001s)]
*  I know. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6351.64s)]
*  Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake, [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6352.6s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing anything [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6356.36s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6362.2s)]
*  But it turns out it's happening. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6363.96s)]
*  So what can you do about it? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6365.4s)]
*  Well, we could whine about it. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6366.36s)]
*  That's a waste of time. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6368.04s)]
*  I'm not in charge of Google. [[01:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6369.24s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it, a way that you could actually get information that's true. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6370.599999999999s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6376.28s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6378.36s)]
*  Subscribe and you'll have a much higher chance. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6382.5199999999995s)]
*  Of hearing what we say and we hope you will. [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCn0OYE1Z8E&t=6386.36s)]
