*  We can get tickets at Tucker Carlson dot com. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=52.400000000000006s)]
*  Hope to see you there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=55.36s)]
*  So what? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=60.0s)]
*  OK, what is happening in Ukraine right now? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=81.4s)]
*  The coverage of the war has sort of fallen off the front page in the United States, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  partly because of the election, I assume, but partly because [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=90.12s)]
*  there are probably developments that our media don't want to talk about. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=93.36s)]
*  But what is the state of it right now, would you say? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, Ukraine's losing the war on the battlefield. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=99.16000000000001s)]
*  That's the basic point. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  There's been a bit of a diversion with a an incursion of some brigades [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  of Ukraine and NATO mercenaries, so-called [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=110.76s)]
*  into a fairly rural northern part of Russia. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=115.92s)]
*  That got a lot of attention, but it's militarily meaningless. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=119.36s)]
*  On the real battlefront, Ukraine has been attrited. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=124.2s)]
*  In other words, they just don't have they don't have the people. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=129.08s)]
*  They don't have the weapon systems. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  They don't have the air defenses. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=135.72s)]
*  And so Russia is continuing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=137.8s)]
*  Russia has said all along, we can negotiate, we can stop. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=140.8s)]
*  But we have issues. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=144.68s)]
*  And the West is and the US and especially Britain. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=145.68s)]
*  No, no, we're going to win. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=150.92000000000002s)]
*  We're going to win. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=152.12s)]
*  So Ukraine loses one to two thousand soldiers a day dead and wounded. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=152.84s)]
*  A day? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=162.32s)]
*  Yeah, a day. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  This is a terrible, terrible onslaught. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  But nobody counts the dead in the Kiev leadership or in Washington [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=168.32s)]
*  or in London or in Warsaw. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=174.64s)]
*  And so this continues because no one wants to take any responsibility [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  in the West for bringing it to a close. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=182.27999999999997s)]
*  So but there is kind of a forcing action with this election, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  because if there is a change in administration, then presumably [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=189.07999999999998s)]
*  there'll be a change, of course, in US policy toward Ukraine. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=193.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I hope anyway, if Trump wins. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=195.76s)]
*  So does that that provides an incentive to the current administration to. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=198.32s)]
*  I don't know what what kind of scenario is that set up? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=203.64s)]
*  Well, there's there's nothing really that this administration [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=206.44s)]
*  going out is going to do. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  I don't think the president probably is in any mental state [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=213.27999999999997s)]
*  to to lead anything at this point. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=217.83999999999997s)]
*  So I think we're kind of on autopilot, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  which is a very bad place to be in general in a dangerous world. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=225.48s)]
*  There are no active discussions that we know of between the United States [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=231.36s)]
*  and Russia, which is the essence of the sine qua non of ending [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  this war and ending it on a responsible basis. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=240.76s)]
*  This is a war between the United States and Russia. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=245.0s)]
*  It's not a war between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=248.36s)]
*  This is the most basic point. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=250.96s)]
*  This is a war provoked by the US with US intentions, with US aims [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  for NATO enlargement. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=259.59999999999997s)]
*  And it would take a president that understands [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=261.4s)]
*  the basics of this and why this was so wrongheaded and such a [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=267.23999999999995s)]
*  an absurd and tragic idea [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=274.44s)]
*  that dates back 30 years now inside the US security state [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=278.44s)]
*  to bring it to a close. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=283.96s)]
*  But Biden was not that person, clearly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  Biden bought into this whole reckless approach [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=288.2s)]
*  30 years ago already and has been part of this tragic adventure [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=292.76s)]
*  that was somehow going to bring down Russia. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=300.48s)]
*  But in the end, it's destroying Ukraine. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=303.24s)]
*  So, yes, we need we need a new president and we need a president that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=306.44s)]
*  honestly understands what this has all been about. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=312.76s)]
*  And the one thing we've discussed and the one thing that's absolutely true [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=317.56s)]
*  is the American people have never been told what this is all about. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=321.76s)]
*  They've been told exactly the opposite. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=325.56s)]
*  And I don't think even now there's an appreciation that NATO forces, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=328.24s)]
*  clearly US forces in some form, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=333.04s)]
*  federal employees or federal contractors are fighting in Russia, fighting Russia. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  Oh, this is absolutely clear. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=340.2s)]
*  We're at war with we have a hot war with Russia right now. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=342.4s)]
*  We are in a hot war because it's not only our financing, our equipment, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=345.6s)]
*  our aims, our objectives, our strategy, our advice, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=349.56s)]
*  but it's our personnel on the ground. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  They are not necessarily in US uniform. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes they're called mercenaries, sometimes they're just not identified. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=362.72s)]
*  But they are calling the shots and Russia knows it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=366.68s)]
*  And that by itself is [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=370.32s)]
*  is is a big reason for alarm. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=374.2s)]
*  Well, especially because Russia doesn't need to lob a nuke into [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=377.64s)]
*  Poland or Europe or the United States to fight back. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=382.28s)]
*  Russia could disable critical American infrastructure without. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, being obvious about it, like, we're very vulnerable [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=390.55999999999995s)]
*  if Russia decides to strike at us. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=393.44s)]
*  Well, the horrible thing about this war from the start was that it [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  could never conceivably have made sense for the United States [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=401.76s)]
*  to cross Russia's red lines because either Russia would win [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=406.4s)]
*  on the battlefield as it's doing or Russia would lose on the battlefield [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=412.35999999999996s)]
*  and then escalate. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=417.96s)]
*  And the escalation could be in many forms. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=419.76s)]
*  Like you say, it could be attacks [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=423.2s)]
*  on US interests around the world through proxies, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=427.15999999999997s)]
*  or it could be as the Russians made clear, if they're losing [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=433.28s)]
*  tactical nuclear weapons to start and with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=438.2s)]
*  escalation, always in sight if [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=443.52s)]
*  Russia was really profoundly threatened. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=447.08s)]
*  So in the end, there was no path to success [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=450.76s)]
*  of a venture that started back in the Clinton administration, continued [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=456.36s)]
*  with Bush, Obama, Trump and Biden, which was to push [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=461.40000000000003s)]
*  NATO to Ukraine, despite the clearest possible, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=469.2s)]
*  brightest, biggest red line that Russia could convey in peacetime, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=475.88000000000005s)]
*  which is don't do that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=483.48s)]
*  And Russia's attitude towards NATO and Ukraine was exactly [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=486.04s)]
*  analogous to what our attitude would be to a Russian military base [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=491.20000000000005s)]
*  on the Rio Grande in Mexico. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=495.32000000000005s)]
*  It would be, don't try that. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  And this is obvious. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=500.72s)]
*  It's not subtle. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=503.04s)]
*  It has been expressed for more than 30 years. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=504.84s)]
*  But now we know and more and more comes out and will come out. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=508.8s)]
*  But Clinton approved this plan in 1994 [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=513.36s)]
*  that NATO would go east, including to Ukraine. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=519.16s)]
*  Zbigniew Brzezinski laid it out in 1997 in an article, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=525.52s)]
*  which I always asserted was not Brzezinski's idea, but his way of telling [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=530.76s)]
*  his colleagues in the civilian sector, let's say, what was already decided. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=537.68s)]
*  And that is that, yes, of course, we will go all the way to Ukraine. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=544.28s)]
*  It became public in 2008 when George W. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=548.68s)]
*  Bush, Jr. pushed at the Bucharest NATO Summit, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=554.0s)]
*  the commitment to enlarge NATO to Ukraine. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=560.1999999999999s)]
*  It became a cause of war in February 2014 when the US conspired to overthrow [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=564.4399999999999s)]
*  a Ukrainian president that was against NATO enlargement, who wanted Ukraine [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=573.8s)]
*  to be neutral because that president understood if you are Ukraine between [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=578.92s)]
*  East and West, try to keep your head down and stay neutral. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=585.0s)]
*  And he understood that. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=589.6800000000001s)]
*  So we had to overthrow him. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=591.0s)]
*  And the US did. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=593.2s)]
*  And that's when the war started. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=594.64s)]
*  So this was predictably a failure on every scenario. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=596.32s)]
*  The particular scenario that is unfolding right now for the moment is [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=602.32s)]
*  ironically, perhaps the safer one, which is that Russia is winning on the battlefield. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=608.96s)]
*  Yes. Because if Russia were losing on the battlefield, we would be seeing [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=614.52s)]
*  escalation to nuclear war and everyone in punditry that says, oh, don't worry [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  about that, that's a bluff. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=629.16s)]
*  I profoundly resent the ignorance of those people. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=633.04s)]
*  Generally when people are ignorant, I don't resent it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=639.2s)]
*  I try to help, but I resent the ignorance when it endangers my grandchildren. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=642.4s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=649.5600000000001s)]
*  And they endanger my grandchildren by saying, don't worry about nuclear war. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=650.48s)]
*  That's a bluff. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=656.0s)]
*  And that I don't want to hear from anybody because anyone that says that [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=657.2s)]
*  understands nothing about the reality of our world today. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=662.1600000000001s)]
*  The people who say that I feel exactly the same way and I'm outraged by it, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=665.96s)]
*  but also distressed by it because of what it says about our leadership class. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=670.44s)]
*  But I noticed that a lot of people who say that are former US military [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=673.76s)]
*  officers working in some think tank, Hudson or AI or CSIS or whatever. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=677.68s)]
*  They're paid to say it. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=684.4s)]
*  They are paid to say it, but you also wonder where in the officer [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=685.68s)]
*  class are the wise people. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=688.64s)]
*  Who in the Pentagon has a realistic assessment of risk and a deep concern [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=691.6s)]
*  for the future of the United States? [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  Where are those people? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=696.76s)]
*  There no doubt are some, but it's always a, a close call because we've known [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=698.08s)]
*  throughout the nuclear era, there have been hotheads, irrational people, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=706.16s)]
*  vulgar people who have called for nuclear war. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=715.96s)]
*  We have come extraordinarily close to nuclear war and we've had people in the [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=719.84s)]
*  US military all along who called for first strikes on various occasions [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=725.88s)]
*  against the Soviet Union, which in any plausible scenario could well have [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=733.0s)]
*  ended the world and those people were in positions of authority. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=740.36s)]
*  The case that I've studied most closely in my life is the Cuban missile crisis. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=746.32s)]
*  I wrote a book about the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis and Kennedy's [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=752.12s)]
*  diplomacy in 1963 to pull back from the brink, but in the Cuban missile crisis, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=757.4s)]
*  almost every one of president Kennedy's advisors said strike and there's very [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=766.08s)]
*  good reason to believe that that would have led to a full scale nuclear war [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=773.6s)]
*  that would have ended civilization. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=779.68s)]
*  Kennedy was in that case, almost the sole restraint within the senior US leadership. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=783.04s)]
*  So we came extraordinarily close and there have been other occasions where we [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=791.68s)]
*  have come extraordinarily close. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=797.0s)]
*  I, we have, I don't know if we discussed it before, but it's one of my go to [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=799.28s)]
*  emblems for trying to help people understand the situation that the atomic [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=808.88s)]
*  scientists who were dead worried about this from the beginning of the atomic [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  age in 1945 established this emblematic doomsday clock in 1947 in the bulletin [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=822.5999999999999s)]
*  of atomic scientists. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=831.8s)]
*  And what this is, is a, an expert view of how close or how far we are from nuclear [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=833.0s)]
*  war, we are the closest ever to nuclear Armageddon today during the entire period [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=840.88s)]
*  since 1947, according to this doomsday clock, the doomsday clock started a few [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=849.12s)]
*  minutes from midnight, midnight meaning doomsday, meaning Armageddon. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=855.8s)]
*  And it went farther away from midnight or closer to midnight, depending on how the [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=861.2s)]
*  cold war was unfolding, whether we were at the height of tensions or during a period [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=866.3199999999999s)]
*  of some pullback from the tensions. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, suffice it to say that at the end of the cold war one, because, and maybe [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=878.72s)]
*  it never really ended because the U S did never really changed its attitudes towards [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=887.96s)]
*  Russia, but at the end of the Soviet union in December, 1991 and the beginning of [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=893.68s)]
*  1992 and with the arrival of the Clinton administration, the atomic scientists put [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=901.68s)]
*  the clock at 17 minutes from midnight. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=908.96s)]
*  That's the farthest that it has ever been since the beginning of the nuclear arms [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=912.64s)]
*  age. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=920.1999999999999s)]
*  Every president since then has brought us closer to Armageddon. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=922.24s)]
*  Clinton, Bush, Obama, Trump, Biden, everyone inherited a clock that they then [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=927.8s)]
*  pushed, I think through U S provocations and policies, all these wars of choice, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=939.88s)]
*  all these invasions of the Middle East, all this NATO enlargement, all of the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=946.36s)]
*  disdain for anything Russia or China says, how dare they even express an opinion? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=952.64s)]
*  We're the only ones that can have an opinion. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=960.4s)]
*  The disdain for Iran, evil. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=963.36s)]
*  This view has led to an aggressiveness and a hubris that has pushed us closer and [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  closer to the brink because the whole attitude of the U S since 1992 was we [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=975.28s)]
*  don't have to listen to anybody. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=983.72s)]
*  We don't have to listen to Russia. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=985.88s)]
*  Russia is a gas station with nuclear weapons was of course the very [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=988.28s)]
*  un-clever phrase, but the idea was, yeah, humiliate them, humiliate them. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=992.64s)]
*  They only have 6,000 nuclear warheads. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=998.52s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1000.64s)]
*  Of course, the way we treat China, the casual talk in Washington these days [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1003.08s)]
*  about the likely war with China, you have people in service, generals talking [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  about, yeah, there could be a war with China in the next two or three years. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1014.6400000000001s)]
*  Are these people mad out of their minds? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1017.84s)]
*  Do they have any idea what they're doing? [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1022.9200000000001s)]
*  But typically, and the theory of our system is we have a president, civilian, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1025.36s)]
*  who is responsible for keeping our country safe, not pushing us to the brink. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1033.72s)]
*  But of course we don't have such a president right now. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1040.12s)]
*  Even when he was functioning, he wasn't keeping us from the brink. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1042.8799999999999s)]
*  He was making declarations that for God's sake, that man must go. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1046.52s)]
*  Speaking of the president of Russia, as if that's the American choice. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1051.56s)]
*  Well, that's not something one should say about even an adversary, but a counterpart [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1056.84s)]
*  that happens to be the second nuclear superpower, but that's how we have acted. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1063.76s)]
*  And Biden walking off soon after his meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1072.3999999999999s)]
*  and then muttering, I think it was as usual at some kind of donor gathering, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1080.2s)]
*  oh, he's a dictator. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1085.44s)]
*  This, the idea of the arrogance and the disdain and the silliness, but the attempt [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1087.48s)]
*  to humiliate the counterparts, that's why in this doomsday clock, we are now 90 [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1099.88s)]
*  seconds to midnight. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1108.0800000000002s)]
*  And from all that I see and know, I just got back from an extended trip through Asia [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1109.96s)]
*  and Europe and talked to many leaders along the way. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1117.5600000000002s)]
*  There's worry everywhere. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1121.24s)]
*  There is absolute worry everywhere. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1123.68s)]
*  Every leader I spoke to, and it was a number of them. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1126.8400000000001s)]
*  What is happening with your country? [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1130.6000000000001s)]
*  Are we being pushed to war? [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1132.76s)]
*  Why do we have to choose between having trade with China or having trade with the [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1134.72s)]
*  United States or having trade with Russia? [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1139.92s)]
*  Why are sanctions on Russia applying to us and breaking our economy? [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1142.52s)]
*  I spoke to leaders all over Asia about these issues. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1147.72s)]
*  And the answer is there is no good answer to this. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1151.68s)]
*  And there is no way to say to them, don't worry, everything's under control [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1156.5600000000002s)]
*  because it's not. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1164.0s)]
*  Most of us, well, actually all of us go through our daily lives using all sorts of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1165.0800000000002s)]

*  Think about it for a minute. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1176.88s)]
*  Think about your free email account, the free messenger system used to chat with [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1178.0s)]
*  your friends, the free weather app or game app you open up and never think about. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1182.44s)]

*  No, it's not free. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1190.3600000000001s)]
*  These companies aren't developing expensive products and just giving them to [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1192.9599999999998s)]

*  And it's happening out in the open without anybody saying anything about it. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1218.4799999999998s)]
*  This is a huge problem. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1222.52s)]
*  And we've been talking about this problem to our friend, Eric Prince for years. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1223.76s)]
*  Someone needs to fix this. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1227.4799999999998s)]
*  And he and his partners have, and now we're partners with them and their [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1229.32s)]
*  company is called unplugged. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1232.4399999999998s)]
*  It's not a software company. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1234.56s)]
*  It's a hardware company. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1235.8s)]
*  They actually make a phone. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1237.36s)]
*  The phone is called unplugged. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1239.6s)]
*  And it's more than that. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1241.7199999999998s)]
*  The purpose of the phone is to protect you from having your life stolen. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1242.8s)]
*  Your data is stolen. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1249.4399999999998s)]
*  It's designed from a privacy first perspective. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1250.6s)]
*  It's got an operating system that they made is called messenger and other apps [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1254.84s)]
*  that help you take charge of your personal data and prevent it from getting [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1257.84s)]

*  manipulate you unplugged. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1265.0s)]
*  Skimmin is to its customers. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1267.24s)]
*  They will promise you. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1268.92s)]
*  And they mean it that your data are not being sold or monetized or shared with anyone [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1269.84s)]
*  from basics like it's custom Libertas operating system, which they wrote, which [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1275.28s)]
*  is designed from the very first day to keep your personal data on your device. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1279.6s)]
*  It also has, believe it or not, a true on off switch that shuts off the power. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1284.08s)]
*  It actually disconnects your battery and ensures that your microphone and your [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1288.7199999999998s)]
*  camera are turned off completely when you want them to be so they're not spying [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1293.1599999999999s)]
*  on you and say your bedroom, which your iPhone is that's a fact. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1297.6399999999999s)]
*  So it is a great way. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1301.9199999999998s)]
*  One of the few ways to actually protect yourself from big tech and big government [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1303.48s)]

*  And there's no, I don't think widespread understanding of this in the United States, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1322.68s)]
*  how quickly things around the world are changing. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1326.44s)]
*  The extent to which the U S government is driving these changes and the overwhelming [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1329.92s)]
*  sense from outside America, that America is in decline because of these decisions. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1334.44s)]
*  Like we're hurting ourselves in addition to a lot of other people. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  But here it seems like everybody in charge wants a war with Iran. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1342.52s)]
*  And I just know from experience watching the Iraq invasion, which I never thought [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1347.88s)]
*  was going to happen, watching the current war with Russia, which I never thought [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1351.3200000000002s)]
*  was going to happen, that when everyone in DC starts saying, Hey, let's have a [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1354.04s)]
*  war with somebody, you're probably going to have a war with that person. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1357.2s)]
*  Are we going to have a war with Iran? [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1360.0s)]
*  Israel just wants that war so much. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1361.72s)]
*  And the Israel lobby is very powerful. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1365.96s)]
*  So we could, but I've never seen such recklessness as the, this Israeli [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1369.44s)]
*  government, reckless extremist, provocative, assassinating counterparts left and right. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1376.0s)]
*  And of course, in the most provocative ways, assassinating the Hamas political [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1386.24s)]
*  negotiator in Tehran on the occasion of the inauguration of the new Iranian president. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1392.96s)]
*  You know, this is aiming for pulling the U S into a broader war. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1402.1599999999999s)]
*  Can I ask you something? [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1408.76s)]
*  So I said, are we going to have a war with Iran and you immediately [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1409.8799999999999s)]
*  said we're being pushed by another country? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1414.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1416.12s)]
*  Is there any reason for the United States acting solely in its own [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1416.36s)]
*  interest to have a war with Iran? [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1420.28s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1421.6s)]
*  And it would be devastating because Iran has allies, including Russia. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1422.96s)]
*  So a war with Iran could easily become world war three, world war three for [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1427.96s)]
*  everyone to understand could easily become a nuclear war, a nuclear war. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1433.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, whatever you're going to say or do with your country, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1440.1599999999999s)]
*  say or do with your children or your grandchildren, say it now, because the [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1443.04s)]
*  world will end in a very quick moment. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1446.96s)]
*  If we fall into that, I should just pause and say you wrecked my morning over [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1449.92s)]
*  breakfast today by describing, describing at length the new Annie Jacobson book. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1453.48s)]
*  On nuclear war, which I hope you will not. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1459.12s)]
*  I won't do it for everybody except that it's a remarkable book. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1462.56s)]
*  It's chilling. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1467.2s)]
*  Uh, I listened to it cause I go for long walks. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1468.9199999999998s)]
*  So I listened to it as an audio book with the author, Annie Jacobson, narrating [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1472.4799999999998s)]
*  it in a very clipped precise way, but it describes in meticulous, rigorous, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1477.1999999999998s)]
*  technical language based on voluminous research, how the world could come to [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1484.32s)]
*  an end in a few minutes. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1490.8s)]
*  Uh, and, uh, it's a very serious book and it's, uh, completely chilling. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1492.1599999999999s)]
*  And it's called nuclear war, nuclear war, a scenario by any Jacobson. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1497.92s)]
*  I just ordered it after a conversation, though I don't want to read it, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1502.3200000000002s)]
*  but I'm sorry to interrupt. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1504.8400000000001s)]
*  I just want to throw that out there because it sounded important. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1506.76s)]
*  Um, but you don't think if the United States were acting in its own [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1508.6000000000001s)]
*  interest, that war with Ron would even be on the table. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1513.5600000000002s)]
*  If the U S were acting in our own interest, we would not even have [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1516.52s)]
*  an argument with Russia right now. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1522.8400000000001s)]
*  We would not have an argument with China right now. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1525.08s)]
*  We would not have an argument with Iran right now. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1527.6399999999999s)]
*  We'd actually be trading, having peaceful relations. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  Uh, and by the way, not to mention saving some hundreds of billions of dollars a [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1535.9599999999998s)]
*  year so that we could fix our roads and our potholes and our broken elevators [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1542.8s)]
*  and escalators and our decrepit, uh, uh, passenger rail travel in this country. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1548.72s)]
*  I keep having to get off of trains that are broken down because Amtrak [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1555.68s)]
*  breaks down all the time. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1560.48s)]
*  It seems, or maybe only when I'm writing it, but in any event, yeah, we could [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1562.0800000000002s)]
*  actually do something for our country. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1566.0800000000002s)]
*  Uh, if we were less obsessed about, uh, or less drawn into these conflicts, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1567.96s)]
*  which are all solvable on a political level without war. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1576.68s)]
*  And, but we don't want to do politics. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1582.6000000000001s)]
*  Uh, we are the United States or we are the Israel lobby, uh, or, uh, we have [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1584.52s)]
*  a plan that goes back to 1994 to expand NATO completely contrary to what we [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1590.24s)]
*  promised the Soviet union in Russia, uh, back in 1990 to 92, we cheated, we lied, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1596.1200000000001s)]
*  but we're going to do it. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1603.64s)]
*  So we're in a very funny way, uh, in this country, obviously, uh, major, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1604.64s)]
*  major challenges at home of just basic living conditions and infrastructure [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1613.32s)]
*  and keeping up with things. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1621.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1623.6s)]
*  Of course we, we've, we've, we've got some dazzling technology and some very rich [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1624.16s)]
*  people, but we've got a lot of people in this country that are not living that way. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1629.52s)]
*  No. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1633.44s)]
*  And, uh, we're not attending to any of it because the most important thing for us [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1633.84s)]
*  is picking fights or being drawn into other people's fights and we, Israel's [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1638.6s)]
*  trying to draw us into a broader war in the middle East that is completely, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1645.52s)]
*  totally a hundred percent against American interests. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1651.92s)]
*  Now I would say that, uh, I give very little credit to this administration [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1655.52s)]
*  for anything, uh, but I would say they give signs that they don't want to be [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1662.44s)]
*  pulled into a war with Iran and they know that Israel is trying to provoke that. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1667.76s)]
*  And they're torn because the Israel lobby is really powerful. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1674.8s)]
*  Uh, and, uh, it's clear the games that Israel is playing in provoking, uh, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1678.48s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah and, uh, Northern Lebanon and essentially at the core, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1684.64s)]
*  um, being unwilling to talk about any political settlement that gives the [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1691.5600000000002s)]
*  Palestinian people a state and some rights as the way to end all of this conflict. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1698.76s)]
*  And instead what Israel wants is that the U S, uh, you know, protects [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1704.52s)]
*  their most extremist positions. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1711.28s)]
*  Uh, and, um, this is of course not in the U S interest. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1714.72s)]
*  It's not in the U S interest to be in a war with Russia. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1719.0s)]
*  Why should we be in a war with Russia? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1723.9599999999998s)]
*  Russia told us absolute and by rush, I mean, president Putin and before him, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1726.08s)]
*  president Yeltsin and I was an advisor to president Yeltsin, the Russian [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1732.04s)]
*  presidents told us absolutely clearly. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1736.08s)]
*  We can cooperate. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1741.6399999999999s)]
*  We can have normal relations, but don't crowd us with your military [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1742.8799999999999s)]
*  bases on our border, something the United States leaders should understand [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1747.84s)]
*  the exact meaning of, because we set that position 201 years ago in the Monroe [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1755.48s)]
*  Dockers and we have repeated it basically every year since, which is don't [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1764.52s)]
*  crowd us with your military in our neighborhood. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1770.48s)]
*  That's all. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1775.6s)]
*  That's all the Russians said. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1776.36s)]
*  We absolutely refused to listen to this. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1779.6399999999999s)]
*  What did the Chinese say? [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1784.04s)]
*  Something very, very simple. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1785.72s)]
*  The Chinese say we are one China. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1789.56s)]
*  You, the Western countries led by Britain in the 19th century. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1794.08s)]
*  And then I, with the, all of the Imperial powers, including Japan at [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1800.3999999999999s)]
*  the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, tried to dismember us. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1805.92s)]
*  China, you tried to pull us to pieces. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1812.0s)]
*  You conquered territory. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1814.5600000000002s)]
*  You invaded us many times. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1816.2s)]
*  In fact, to my mind, the most cynical war of modern history was Britain's [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1818.8400000000001s)]
*  invasion of China in 1839 called the first opium war, which was to force [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1824.68s)]
*  China to accept British opium in trade. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1830.64s)]
*  The Chinese knew, no, we don't want to become opium addicts. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1834.36s)]
*  And Britain said, hell, this is free trade. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1837.6399999999999s)]
*  It's our opium. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1839.9199999999998s)]
*  As if, you know, the, the Colombian cartel would invade us and, on free [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1841.28s)]
*  trade principles. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1845.8799999999999s)]
*  So in any event, the Chinese are saying one thing, don't, don't dismantle us. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1847.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1855.2399999999998s)]
*  We went through that. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1856.04s)]
*  We went through 150 years of that. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1857.08s)]
*  So Taiwan, that's part of China. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1859.56s)]
*  You said it United States. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1862.4s)]
*  That's the basis of our diplomatic relations. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1864.8s)]
*  Stop provoking. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1867.56s)]
*  That's all. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1869.2s)]
*  We can have perfectly normal relations, but don't play the game [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1870.44s)]
*  of trying to break us apart. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1876.72s)]
*  But we have forces in the U S that seem compelled to make trouble. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1880.04s)]
*  Literally that we must provoke. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1887.28s)]
*  We must overthrow Russia. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1889.76s)]
*  We must divide Russia. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1891.48s)]
*  We must dismember China. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1892.96s)]
*  We must not allow other countries just to get on with things. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1894.84s)]
*  That's all the other countries are saying. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1899.88s)]
*  When I say these things, it sounds so weird, by the way, to Americans who [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1903.16s)]
*  are reading the New York times or reading the Washington post or reading [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1908.64s)]
*  the Wall Street journal, because Mr. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1912.48s)]
*  Sachs, China's our enemy. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1914.44s)]
*  They're doing all these terrible things. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1916.4s)]
*  Russia, they're the Imperial blah, blah, blah, because we're fed a bunch of [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1918.4799999999998s)]
*  lines that are complete nonsense. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1925.1599999999999s)]
*  But if you say it again and say it again and say it again, and the U S is, you [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1929.28s)]
*  know better than anybody, USG trying to control the narrative, trying to [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1935.12s)]
*  control what we hear, trying to control what social media can say. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1940.12s)]
*  Well, the simplest truths become completely clouded. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1945.6399999999999s)]
*  So the point is you asked me, does the U S have an interest in war with Iran? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1952.04s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1959.48s)]
*  Does the U S have an interest in war with Russia? [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1960.6399999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1963.84s)]
*  Does the U S have an interest in war with China? [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1965.1599999999999s)]
*  God forbid is my only answer. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1967.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1970.0s)]
*  Be probably the end of the world. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1970.28s)]
*  I think there's a widespread recognition of that, that we can't win a war against [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1973.36s)]
*  China, obviously, and I think most people know that, that we're not winning our [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1978.36s)]
*  current war against Russia. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1981.48s)]
*  Most people understand that. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1982.6s)]
*  But I think in the public mind, I'm just guessing, but that Iran seems very far [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1984.2s)]
*  away and primitive and maybe it is a country we can kind of push around and [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1988.72s)]
*  maybe we could have some sort of limited engagement with Iran and kill the [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1993.28s)]
*  leadership and then the freedom fighters take over and it becomes a democracy again. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=1997.68s)]
*  I think people may believe that. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2002.28s)]
*  What would you say to them or to our policymakers who are making that case? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2004.24s)]
*  Let me start by saying that Iran or Persia, to use its classical name, is one [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2009.3600000000001s)]
*  of the greatest and ancient civilizations on the planet, and it is an amazing [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2017.92s)]
*  civilization and an amazing place and a highly sophisticated country, about a [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2026.36s)]
*  hundred million people and a highly technologically sophisticated place, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2032.76s)]
*  including a militarily sophisticated place. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2039.52s)]
*  And we have known that. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2044.9599999999998s)]
*  And one of the concerns about Iran is that with all of that technical [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2047.32s)]
*  sophistication, they felt threatened by the United States and threatened by [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2054.84s)]
*  other neighbors as well, and have had a program to develop nuclear weapons of [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2063.92s)]
*  their own, and that seems no doubt to be true. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2072.0s)]
*  And what the Iranians said is if we had the right geopolitical context where [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2076.56s)]
*  you're not threatening us, where you're not trying to crush us, where you're not [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2085.16s)]
*  trying to overthrow our regime, we will end that nuclear program. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2089.24s)]
*  But if you're trying to overthrow us and threatening us and damning us in every [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2097.7599999999998s)]
*  possible way, how can we deal with you? [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2104.84s)]
*  And that led to a number of years of negotiation, and the negotiations [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2109.4s)]
*  culminated during the Obama last years of his government in a treaty that was [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2116.2400000000002s)]
*  called the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Agreement in which Iran would [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2125.48s)]
*  stop its nuclear arms development, and we would end the sanctions on [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2134.7599999999998s)]
*  Iran and normalize relations. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2142.96s)]
*  Well, our neocon world and especially the Israel lobby could not accept that [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2146.24s)]
*  because Iran is the pure enemy from Israel's point of view. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2153.32s)]
*  And so the Israelis, to my mind, in a kind of mad, self-defeating, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2162.44s)]
*  devastatingly wrong-headed approach, convinced the Trump administration, and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2170.44s)]
*  Bolton was there, of course, doing his usual job of messing things up, which [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2178.2s)]
*  he's done all his career, to break this agreement. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2184.2s)]
*  And the U.S. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2189.2799999999997s)]
*  kept sanctions pulled out of the agreement with Iran. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2191.48s)]
*  And where are we today? [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2196.64s)]
*  Well, where we are today is that it's commonly said and reported that Iran is [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2199.0s)]
*  now either already with the nuclear weapons or with the nuclear weapons [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2208.24s)]
*  within reach in days or weeks because it has been enhancing its uranium, and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2215.32s)]
*  it could make a nuclear weapon if it chooses to do so. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2224.7200000000003s)]
*  In other words, pulling out of diplomacy solved nothing. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2228.88s)]
*  It didn't end any threat. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2234.96s)]
*  It didn't topple any regime. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2237.88s)]
*  It only pushed Iran to continue the course that it was on and to put Iran and [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2241.3199999999997s)]
*  the U.S. on this collision course. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2255.16s)]
*  Now, Israel is trying to provoke an outright war on this basis, the idea [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2258.52s)]
*  that diplomacy, that normal relations, that an agreement that actually was [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2264.36s)]
*  reached and backed by the U.N. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2270.28s)]
*  and backed by all the major powers, including the United States and Europe [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2272.96s)]
*  and Russia and China and the United Nations, that maybe diplomacy could [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2278.36s)]
*  solve something that, of course, is utterly rejected by Israel and by the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2283.76s)]
*  Israel lobby and what Bibi is trying to do, what Netanyahu is trying to do, is [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2292.36s)]
*  to pull the U.S. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2299.7200000000003s)]
*  into a full-fledged war to destroy Iran. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2302.0s)]
*  But if he wants a war with Iran, just go have your war with Iran. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2306.2000000000003s)]
*  Why do we have to be involved? [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2308.6800000000003s)]
*  What do we have to do with this? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2309.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2310.6800000000003s)]
*  If Israel were to have a war with Iran, Iran could and would cause grievous [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2312.44s)]
*  damage to Israel, and Israel might in the end, by the way, use its nuclear weapons. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2324.3199999999997s)]
*  Then why not? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2331.92s)]
*  I mean, look, people face problems like this, not just geopolitically or on the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2332.56s)]
*  global stage, but in their daily lives. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2337.7999999999997s)]
*  Like, I would like this, but there are restraints on what I can do because of [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2340.16s)]
*  things I can't control. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2342.96s)]
*  Maybe I hate my neighbors, but you have to, these are the things you deal with in life. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2344.44s)]
*  Like, you figure it out. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2348.7599999999998s)]
*  If you don't like your neighbor, you think your neighbor is a little bit [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2350.08s)]
*  dangerous, you provoke them every day and try to humiliate them and do whatever [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2352.72s)]
*  you can to damage their interests, maybe invade their lawn, maybe destroy their shed. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2359.04s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2364.6s)]
*  And it's like, I don't think so. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2366.52s)]
*  That's not good for you or for anyone else. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2369.08s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is I certainly don't want Israel or any other country to [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2371.08s)]
*  be destroyed or have a war, but I'm still baffled by why we have to be involved. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2373.8799999999997s)]
*  Like, what in the world do we have to do with this? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2380.48s)]
*  We're the United States of America. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2382.8399999999997s)]
*  We're on the other side of the planet. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2384.0s)]
*  We don't have any connection to Iran. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2385.8799999999997s)]
*  Why would we even consider fighting Iran? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2388.3999999999996s)]
*  This is just nuts. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2391.48s)]
*  We would consider it because Iran is our implacable foe according to the Israel [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2393.0s)]
*  lobby and according to a propaganda that of course went back to the hostage [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2401.08s)]
*  taking crisis of 1979 and the revolution in Iran and like so many things in our [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2408.0s)]
*  world, you can tell a narrative as you like, as long as you hide every bit of real [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2418.2s)]
*  history. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2427.6s)]
*  So Iran was not an enemy of the United States in some natural and implacable way. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2428.68s)]
*  But in 1953, when a democratically elected and popular and very decent and [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2438.0s)]
*  clever leader of Iran thought that maybe Iran should get some more benefit from [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2447.64s)]
*  oil that Britain was willfully extracting in Imperial terms. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2456.04s)]
*  It's oil, Iranian oil. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2462.16s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2464.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2464.6s)]
*  Well, as the old joke said, how did our oil get under their sand? [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2465.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, this was this of course is their oil, but the vision of Imperial powers was [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2471.28s)]
*  we can go where we want, when we want. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2479.16s)]
*  And it's really our oil. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2481.96s)]
*  We need your oil. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2483.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  That was the British view. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2486.68s)]
*  The British Empire was not a nice little fair enterprise. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2488.36s)]
*  The British Empire was a completely extractive empire. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2494.64s)]
*  Well, suffice it to say, and the point I was going to make without diverting us so much [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2498.7599999999998s)]
*  is that in 1953, Britain and the US teamed up to overthrow this democratic government. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2503.52s)]
*  We love democracy. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2514.2799999999997s)]
*  So let's put in a police state, which is exactly what we did. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2515.7999999999997s)]
*  So we overthrew the democracy. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2519.72s)]
*  We put in a monarch, which became a police state, and the Iranians lived under that and [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2521.64s)]
*  they didn't like it. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2529.12s)]
*  And in 1979, as the Shah of Iran that we installed through a coup, a CIA MI6 coup was [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2530.64s)]
*  dying of cancer, the Iranians said, OK, we want our country back. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2543.36s)]
*  And that, of course, was the occasion at the time for the hostage taking of our diplomats, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2548.44s)]
*  because it's a long story, but Carter had taken the Shah in, who was the mortal enemy [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2558.4s)]
*  of so many people in Iran after decades of his police state. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2566.08s)]
*  Well, all of these issues have history and ways to resolve them. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2573.48s)]
*  And by the 1990s or by the early 2000s, had we behaved like normal adult people? [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2580.8s)]
*  Well, maybe not normal, but peace seeking people. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2593.04s)]
*  This could all have been long ago past history. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2597.7200000000003s)]
*  But what did the United States do? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2602.1600000000003s)]
*  The United States, after the release of the hostages, armed Iraq to attack Iran and to [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2604.56s)]
*  kill hundreds of thousands of Iranians during the 1980s, including with chemical weapons. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2613.7200000000003s)]
*  That was our ally, one should recall, Saddam Hussein, our ally. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2621.44s)]
*  Who we executed. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2626.52s)]
*  Of course, who we later executed, which we do for most of our allies. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2627.36s)]
*  So this is a stressful time here. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2631.84s)]
*  The kids going back to school vacation is over. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2633.56s)]
*  It's the height of a presidential election season. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2635.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2638.04s)]
*  You need a good night's sleep, but it's never been harder to get it. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2639.52s)]
*  So we're talking about this in the office the other day, and a couple of people who [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2644.1200000000003s)]
*  work here were raving about a product called Eat Sleep. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2647.2000000000003s)]
*  And I wanted to know more about it. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2653.08s)]
*  It turns out that temperature has a lot to do with whether or not you sleep comfortably [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2654.32s)]
*  and wake up feeling rested like you actually slept. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2658.4s)]
*  Now, the makers of Eat Sleep Pod figured out that if you make a climate controlled [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2661.48s)]
*  mattress cover, you can add to your existing bed. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2664.8s)]
*  You don't have to buy a new bed. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2667.24s)]
*  Just the cover that it changes everything. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2668.64s)]
*  You get far fewer problems with falling asleep and staying asleep. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2670.84s)]
*  And so you feel rested the next day. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2674.96s)]
*  Sleep actually has its desired effect. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2677.08s)]
*  The Eat Sleep Pod can be used to warm up or cool off your bed. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2679.32s)]
*  And that matters because temperatures change seasonally. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2683.56s)]
*  We have climate change in this country. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2686.64s)]
*  It's called winter. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2688.44s)]
*  And so you can feel comfortable all night long. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2689.72s)]
*  It even adjusts to different preferences on either side of the bed, which might be [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2691.4399999999996s)]
*  helpful in your relationship if you have one of those relationships where the [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2695.3999999999996s)]
*  different partners want different temperatures. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2699.8399999999997s)]
*  And those are pretty common. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2701.3199999999997s)]
*  The Eat Sleep Pod has been studied. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2702.6s)]
*  It's been proven to improve people's sleep and health. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2704.08s)]
*  Mark Zuckerberg's into it. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2707.72s)]
*  Elon Musk on the other side. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2708.68s)]
*  Many others use this product, including people here. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2709.7999999999997s)]
*  So try it. Go to eat sleep dot com slash Tucker. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2713.52s)]
*  Use the code Tucker to get 350 bucks off the Pod for Ultra recommended. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2716.0s)]
*  But the point is we don't seek peace. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2722.56s)]
*  And especially after 1991, when we got the idea that not only do we not seek [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2727.6s)]
*  peace with anybody, no one can touch us. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2736.4s)]
*  We're the most powerful country. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2739.52s)]
*  We can do anything we want. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2741.36s)]
*  We're the world's sole superpower. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2743.0s)]
*  We're the indispensable nation. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2744.84s)]
*  We are the greatest colossus in the history of the world, including the [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2747.2s)]
*  Roman Empire, every one of those things was said by, again, I'll say grownups [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2752.32s)]
*  who don't act like grownups, but the idea was we can do anything we want. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2758.32s)]
*  So Iran, you're our enemy. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2762.6s)]
*  Axis of evil. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2765.32s)]
*  We don't have to negotiate with anybody over anything. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2768.36s)]
*  You know, one of the points that's very interesting about the Ukraine [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2773.08s)]
*  war is a principle that we have. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2777.64s)]
*  It's stated it's a article 10 of a NATO charter that we are so proud of, which [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2781.92s)]
*  is that Russia has no say in any decisions we want to make about enlarging NATO up [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2789.36s)]
*  to Russia's borders, that this is not a matter of any legitimate interest of Russia. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2800.16s)]
*  That's explicit. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2807.3199999999997s)]
*  That's called our open door policy, which is we don't accept even on principle. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2808.96s)]
*  The idea that Russia has any say or any interest in whether Ukraine hosts [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2816.44s)]
*  US military bases and US missile systems. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2823.7599999999998s)]
*  We, Putin was told by Blinken, according to very knowledgeable sources in January [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2828.7599999999998s)]
*  2022, that the US reserves the right to put missiles in Ukraine next door. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2836.4799999999996s)]
*  Putin said, ah, but I thought president Biden said that US wouldn't do that. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2844.16s)]
*  And apparently I wasn't in that conversation, but apparently the response [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2848.7599999999998s)]
*  of secretary Blinken was no, no, no, we reserve the right to do what we want. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2853.16s)]
*  Those are our systems. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2858.8399999999997s)]
*  This is not something you have a say about. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2860.24s)]
*  So this is our approach to the world. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2863.16s)]
*  Which is Blinken. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2866.56s)]
*  So you just revealed something interesting. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2867.44s)]
*  It sounds like Blinken's running the administration or its foreign policy. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2869.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, who knows who, who, who tells Blinken what to do? [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2872.92s)]
*  Who do you think tells him what to do? [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2876.88s)]
*  I think that it's important to understand this a big machine. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2878.3199999999997s)]
*  It's a trillion dollar plus machine, the military industrial system of the United States. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2882.6000000000004s)]
*  It gets set in course in a pretty deep way. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2889.6000000000004s)]
*  There's a strategy. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2895.0800000000004s)]
*  The strategy is not changed when a new president comes to office. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2896.6400000000003s)]
*  They may think they have some say about it, but they have not very much say. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2900.92s)]
*  The strategy of NATO enlargement, as I said, goes back literally to 1994. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2906.4s)]
*  So this has been a 30 year program. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2912.0800000000004s)]
*  It's very deeply entrained. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2915.52s)]
*  And president Putin has a nice line that I read recently in a forthcoming book, [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2918.0s)]
*  where he talks about the fact that he's talked to us presidents. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2925.04s)]
*  He said it in his interview with you, which is in the morning, they say one thing. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2928.2400000000002s)]
*  And then in the afternoon, they explained to you, well, it's the opposite because [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2932.8s)]
*  someone has, has come to them to explain, no, it doesn't work that way. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2936.44s)]
*  And in this, in this forthcoming wonderful book by a historian who tracks this whole period, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2940.64s)]
*  he, he quotes Putin as saying that, you know, the president will say something, but then [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2950.04s)]
*  the men in the dark suits and blue ties show up and they explain to the president how it [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2956.16s)]
*  really is. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2962.0s)]
*  And I think that this is basically correct, which is there is a permanent state. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2963.56s)]
*  It is a permanent security state. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2969.12s)]
*  It is a big business. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2971.04s)]
*  Remember, we have 750 overseas military bases. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2972.52s)]
*  We have 6000 nuclear warheads. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2977.52s)]
*  We have a trillion dollar military budget on the surface, not to mention other kinds [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2980.64s)]
*  of spending that aren't directly in that budget. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2987.2799999999997s)]
*  This a big, big machine. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2990.84s)]
*  And this machine is out explicitly according to every doctrine that is published also, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=2993.8799999999997s)]
*  not just private, but published is out for what was already defined by the defense [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3002.3999999999996s)]
*  department decades ago as full spectrum dominance in every part of the world. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3007.7999999999997s)]
*  Full spectrum dominance is an interesting term, but it means the United States will [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3014.3199999999997s)]
*  be the dominant power of every region of the world. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3019.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a kind of crazy idea. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3025.4399999999996s)]
*  I call it completely delusional, in fact, because as you travel and I travel, we see [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3027.68s)]
*  we see the world in a little bit more symmetric way. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3034.6s)]
*  Yes, the U.S. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3039.9599999999996s)]
*  is a powerful country, but it's 4.1% of the world population. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3041.56s)]
*  There's another 95.9% of the world population. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3045.76s)]
*  They don't quite see themselves as being run by us in every region of the world. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3049.5600000000004s)]
*  And for the U.S. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3055.84s)]
*  to say we have full spectrum dominance in Central Asia or on Russia's border, silly, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3056.8s)]
*  or in over other nuclear powers or in East Asia, where China has an industrial base [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3065.28s)]
*  twice the size of the United States and a population four times the size of the United [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3078.48s)]
*  States and hundreds of nuclear weapons and their own interests and a civilization that [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3084.04s)]
*  is 10 times longer lived than the United States, that we dominate China. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3090.04s)]
*  Well, that just seems like a recipe for nonstop war. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3097.6s)]
*  And in the nuclear age, a recipe for at some moment at whether it's 90 seconds or [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3104.0s)]
*  whenever it is from now triggering the absolutely catastrophic, unimaginable [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3111.92s)]
*  end because we provoke. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3119.84s)]
*  We don't talk. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3123.4s)]
*  We provoke. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3124.64s)]
*  And this is the most important thing that any president needs to understand. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3126.08s)]
*  So if and I do think Trump understands it. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3133.28s)]
*  The question does, by the way, and JD Vance understands it. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3136.92s)]
*  JD Vance definitely understands. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3140.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3141.16s)]
*  And this is extremely important because we've not even had candidates talking this [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3141.48s)]
*  way from the major parties. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3146.32s)]
*  So let's say Trump wins is allowed to win in order to be too cynical about our system, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3147.76s)]
*  which everyone wants to believe in. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3153.28s)]
*  You know, I think pretty tough to overcome what you've just described for anybody to [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3155.6800000000003s)]
*  overcome that. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3160.96s)]
*  But let's say Trump wins Trump advance win. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3162.48s)]
*  What are the first things they should do to change the trajectory away from self [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3166.28s)]
*  defeating, away from the self harm that we're committing against our own country? [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3173.2400000000002s)]
*  And toward, you know, toward a series of policies and help the United States and [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3177.6000000000004s)]
*  restore sanity to the world. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3182.92s)]
*  Like, what do you need to do? [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3184.4s)]
*  You know, what, what both Trump and, and Vance are saying about Ukraine is exactly [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3186.1200000000003s)]
*  right. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3194.44s)]
*  And it's completely spot on and it's utterly urgent that it be heard and [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3195.28s)]
*  understood. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3202.56s)]
*  And that is there is no basis for this war and that it was provoked deliberately [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3203.8s)]
*  accidentally on a bluff, whatever, by the U S pushing this NATO business up to [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3211.72s)]
*  Russia's border in a way we would never accept in our own hemisphere. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3218.56s)]
*  So they both get this exactly. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3223.12s)]
*  And that's great. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3225.56s)]
*  And they understand this a completely losing proposition. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3227.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's correct also, because if Russia wins, it's a losing proposition. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3231.92s)]
*  If Russia loses, it's even a bigger losing proposition by the risk of nuclear war. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3237.7599999999998s)]
*  So they get that very much. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3244.04s)]
*  And Trump is absolutely right. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3246.7999999999997s)]
*  Also that this war could end in a day. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3248.7999999999997s)]
*  That's not even, that's not even a rhetorical gloss. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3252.04s)]
*  This war will end the moment a U S president picks up the phone or uses my [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3256.64s)]
*  zoom account, as far as I'm concerned, connects with president Putin and says, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3263.6s)]
*  you know, that NATO enlargement, that was a bad idea. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3268.6s)]
*  I don't know how that got started. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3272.6s)]
*  I know when I'm for 30 years, but that's the end of the war. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3274.24s)]
*  The fighting will stop that moment. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3277.92s)]
*  There are, there will be things to resolve, but that will be the end of the war [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3279.84s)]
*  because that's the whole premise of this war. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3284.2s)]
*  And to this moment, the current administration is saying Ukraine will be [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3288.08s)]
*  part of NATO, so they're guaranteeing that the war will go on. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3292.8799999999997s)]
*  So Ukraine, they got it nailed down. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3296.96s)]
*  What I would want to say to them. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3301.08s)]
*  How do you do that? [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3302.44s)]
*  Even if you're president, I mean, you said a minute ago, presidents arrive in [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3304.08s)]
*  office with the fantasy that they're in charge, but they're not these policies. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3307.6s)]
*  No, the presidents can be in charge. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3311.2799999999997s)]
*  I, they are, they will sit down and it's like, uh, we, we now see, I think I [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3317.24s)]
*  haven't read the new point extra book, which was just reviewed, uh, which dumps [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3324.24s)]
*  on, on Trump and the Bolton book, which I did read parts of, which I found [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3329.16s)]
*  revolting, but part of what, uh, these aides do is, uh, they try to trick the [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3334.0s)]
*  president, they lie to the president. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3343.84s)]
*  They try to continue an aggressive agenda. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3346.48s)]
*  So it takes smarts for a president to be able to pull this off. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3349.4s)]
*  It absolutely. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3355.32s)]
*  Uh, but the president actually has the power to do it, but they have to be [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3357.0s)]
*  really tough and really resolute. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3363.28s)]
*  And they have to know that they're going to hear a lot of bullshit from a lot of [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3365.88s)]
*  people in dark suits in blue with blue ties. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3371.2000000000003s)]
*  They will hear a lot of bullshit because this is a deeply entrained process. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3374.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3380.0s)]
*  And so that it can be done. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3380.5600000000004s)]
*  Uh, it's not impossible. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3386.0400000000004s)]
*  And what makes it more likely right now is that the, I think we're at the end of [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3390.28s)]
*  a 30 year neocon cycle because remember this started 30 years ago. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3396.4s)]
*  I saw the beginning of it. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3401.7200000000003s)]
*  I didn't understand it at the time. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3403.0400000000004s)]
*  I was advisor to president Yeltsin. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3404.6800000000003s)]
*  I saw the U S was not being cooperative. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3407.28s)]
*  I couldn't understand why you had a president that wanted democracy in Russia. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3409.6400000000003s)]
*  He wanted normal relations and the United States was saying the hell with you. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3414.36s)]
*  Basically on many different things. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3418.56s)]
*  And I didn't get it then, but now I understand of course, much better that [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3421.0s)]
*  this was the beginning of 30 years of, we will corner you, we will defeat you. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3425.6s)]
*  We may dismember you, but we will make sure you're a fifth rate country. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3429.7999999999997s)]
*  Uh, okay. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3435.4s)]
*  That 30 years, I believe has now been exposed as a terrible failure. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3436.7999999999997s)]
*  So no one could call us foreign policy over the past 30 years as a success in [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3443.7200000000003s)]
*  any way, every war we fought has been a disaster, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3450.96s)]
*  Libya, Ukraine, these are all wars of choice that we decided that we went in. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3459.0800000000004s)]
*  And we've spent depending on the count, $5 trillion, $7 trillion. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3466.96s)]
*  We ran up our debt. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3472.56s)]
*  We busted the economy. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3474.32s)]
*  We ignored all of our infrastructure and our domestic issues for this [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3475.92s)]
*  remarkably delusional idea that we would run the world. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3481.72s)]
*  So if Trump and Vance come in, uh, or whoever comes in, they have one advantage, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3486.4s)]
*  which was no one could call the current course successful. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3493.92s)]
*  And there are probably people in the deep state, not everybody by any [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3498.0s)]
*  means who know my God, okay, we've done enough, no more perpetual wars. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3502.4s)]
*  We better do something different. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3508.12s)]
*  So the president has the, uh, certainly the constitutional authority. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3509.96s)]
*  And if they're a smart leader, the capacity to push and they're coming [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3518.1600000000003s)]
*  in at a moment where maybe the door is a bit a jar to a change of direction [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3524.52s)]
*  by no means automatic. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3530.8399999999997s)]
*  It's not like the Washington establishment is sitting up and saying, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3532.48s)]
*  oh, we get it. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3536.72s)]
*  No, but they can't be sitting there saying it's all working great. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3537.7999999999997s)]
*  So I think that there is that recognition, but the main thing I would say to, uh, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3542.9199999999996s)]
*  to, uh, president Trump and JD Vance, if they win or to whoever is president is [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3549.72s)]
*  that lesson that you understand about Ukraine is actually the same with China. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3557.28s)]
*  That's even a more hard to accept and swallow idea in Washington right now, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3564.1200000000003s)]
*  because in Washington, one idea, I think even JD Vance says it, but I really [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3572.28s)]
*  disagree and I want him to use the same reasoning to understand it is we have no [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3578.96s)]

*  It ain't true. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3589.6000000000004s)]
*  We have to compete with China economically. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3591.7200000000003s)]
*  We have to compete with China technologically. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3594.2400000000002s)]
*  Of course we have to trade with China also. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3596.52s)]
*  We should go visit China by the way, because a wonderful place, but we have no [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3599.0800000000004s)]
*  intrinsic fight with China and it's the same logic that they have understood. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3603.92s)]
*  These are the Ukraine and Russia. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3610.92s)]
*  We have no intrinsic fight with Russia. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3613.52s)]
*  We have no intrinsic fight with China. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3616.44s)]
*  So that's the main thing I want understood, which is all of these debacles [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3619.6400000000003s)]

*  We have to determine who's in power. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3631.84s)]

*  We don't need that. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3661.32s)]
*  They're expensive. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3662.6800000000003s)]

*  We need to make our country work properly. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3667.92s)]
*  Cause you and I see when we go abroad, the infrastructure abroad sparkles [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3670.6s)]
*  compared to what we live in the United States. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3676.2400000000002s)]
*  And it's not even, I've traveled my whole life as I know you have. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3679.48s)]
*  And you know, you're used to thinking of the developing world and then coming back [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3682.12s)]
*  to the kind of respite of the United States. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3686.48s)]
*  Nothing like that anymore. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3688.68s)]
*  Pull into Kennedy or SFO or LAX or Boston Logan from abroad. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3690.04s)]
*  And the first thing you notice is that it's dirtier and more chaotic. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3695.84s)]
*  It's less attentive to the individual. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3701.0s)]
*  It's harsher than the developing country you're flying in from. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3703.44s)]
*  And it's so heartbreaking. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3707.84s)]
*  You can't believe if people traveled more, we'd have a revolution in this country. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3709.52s)]
*  If they saw that Turkey is nicer than the United States, what? [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3713.4s)]
*  I had a wonderful, I had a wonderful conversation with the, an Italian [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3717.4s)]
*  political leader who I was in Northern Italy and the Bolzano, beautiful city in [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3723.08s)]
*  the Alps, and I was saying how sparkling all the infrastructure is. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3728.8s)]
*  And he's, he kind of sighed and said, yes, it's very nice, but it isn't Oslo [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3732.52s)]
*  and Copenhagen there it's even more. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3738.2s)]
*  But then he said, and I was really surprised, but Oslo and Copenhagen, if you [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3740.56s)]
*  go to China right now, they're leaving those places behind and that's what we [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3744.7599999999998s)]
*  see, which is absolutely true. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3750.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, it's just so depressing. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3753.2s)]
*  It's just so awful. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3754.6s)]
*  And it's what's awful about it is that most people don't understand it. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3755.72s)]
*  They don't know how thoroughly they've been betrayed by their leaders and by [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3759.96s)]
*  the advisors to their leaders, you know, the Bill Kristol's of the world who [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3764.48s)]
*  really just don't care at all about the United States at all, not even, it's not [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3767.2799999999997s)]
*  even an afterthought to them. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3770.0s)]
*  It's all about something very different. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3771.68s)]
*  And they've been screwed. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3773.84s)]
*  Like all the money went overseas. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3775.36s)]
*  All the energy is focused abroad. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3777.4s)]
*  Maybe in their little communities, wherever they live, things are, are nice [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3779.2400000000002s)]
*  enough, but for the rest of America, what are we doing? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3784.84s)]
*  Why are we pouring unbelievable amounts of money and danger and lives [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3790.0s)]
*  into all of these conflicts? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3796.28s)]
*  And so my main message to, you know, I, because I really think Trump and Vance [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3798.84s)]
*  get it on Ukraine completely. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3805.4s)]
*  But what I don't want is, and you hear it in Washington is the idea, well, we [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3807.76s)]
*  have to stop that so we can take on our real foe, which is China or Iran. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3813.56s)]
*  They're not our real foe in any way, shape or form. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3819.64s)]
*  We have issues with them. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3824.08s)]
*  We have competition in the markets and technology, as I said, in many things, [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3825.52s)]
*  but they're not an enemy and there's no reason for them to be an enemy. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3831.2400000000002s)]
*  And so it's the exactly the same logic. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3835.7999999999997s)]
*  Except on the question of Taiwan. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3838.7599999999998s)]
*  I think there are a lot of people who maybe haven't thought it through, who [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3840.7999999999997s)]
*  feel like preserving Taiwan sovereignty to the extent it has sovereignty, I [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3844.4399999999996s)]
*  guess, is a core American interest. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3849.12s)]
*  What's your view? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3851.9599999999996s)]
*  The, the issue with Taiwan is that the United States policy, absolutely clear. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3853.16s)]
*  It's the basis of our diplomatic relations with China is what's called the [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3860.64s)]
*  one China policy, which is that Taiwan is part of China. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3865.16s)]
*  As everybody knows, there was a civil war in China in 1949, the losing side of the [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3869.64s)]
*  civil war, the KMT, the Kuomintang fled in their remnants to Taiwan, which was [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3875.96s)]
*  part of it, it was actually at, at for a period, a Japanese colony because Japan [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3885.04s)]
*  had invaded the Qing dynasty and taken Taiwan away, but it was part of China [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3893.68s)]
*  traditionally in the Qing period for centuries, but the ROC, the Republic of [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3901.2s)]
*  China, which was the losing side of the civil war, installed themselves as a [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3908.6s)]
*  military government on the Island of Taiwan off the coast of the mainland. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3914.04s)]
*  Now what's interesting is that the Republic of China, that is the Taiwan [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3919.44s)]
*  installed government on the losing side of the civil war said there's one China, [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3925.56s)]
*  but it's us and on the other side in Beijing, they also said, yes, we agree. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3930.6400000000003s)]
*  There's one China, but it's us. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3936.1600000000003s)]
*  And so there wasn't a disagreement of whether there's one China or two China's. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3938.6800000000003s)]
*  There's one China, according to the Republic of China and according to the [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3943.92s)]
*  People's Republic of China, People's Republic of China being the mainland, [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3948.36s)]
*  the place with the 1.4 billion people. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3952.52s)]
*  When the U S normalized relations with the People's Republic of China, it said [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3956.1200000000003s)]
*  we do so on the basis of a one China policy that Taiwan is part of China. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3962.8s)]
*  But the understanding was that there are two systems because Taiwan has developed [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3970.08s)]
*  now actually for more than a century, partly under the Japanese Imperial rule. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3977.0s)]
*  And then later under the KMT or the Kuomintang period into a market based system. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3983.32s)]
*  And China was not yet a market based economy at the time. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3993.88s)]
*  So one country, two systems. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=3996.96s)]
*  And we said there should be peace across the Taiwan straits. [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4000.08s)]
*  So that the two sides should resolve their differences amicably, which to my mind is [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4006.36s)]
*  a perfectly sound and achievable standard. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4012.96s)]
*  So our policy is that there is one China, China's policy by China, I mean, the mainland. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4017.7200000000003s)]
*  There is one China and lurking in China's mind is don't break us apart because we had [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4024.56s)]
*  enough of you, the outside world, breaking us apart from 1839 to 1949, trying in every [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4034.16s)]
*  which way to dismember us, to invade us, which was done repeatedly, as I mentioned earlier. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4043.6s)]
*  So China's position is, yes, there's one China. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4050.16s)]
*  We want an amicable relationship with Taiwan. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4054.3599999999997s)]
*  We have accepted two systems and that principle, but we don't want the United States or anyone [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4061.0s)]
*  else provoking secession, independence, a war across this narrow straits because both [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4070.56s)]
*  sides understand that there is one China and we should not be divided. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4080.88s)]
*  But in the US, because it's part of our deep state ideology, it is provoke, provoke, weaken, [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4086.56s)]
*  create divisions, badmouth, name call, support insurgencies, which we do. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4097.6s)]
*  I hope no one's shocked about that, but that is standard CIA ops. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4106.28s)]
*  And so there is part of our government which spurs secession or independence movements [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4111.8s)]
*  in Taiwan, which would lead to war. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4123.2s)]
*  Absolutely. And I tell my Taiwanese friends and I have many Taiwanese friends, don't [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4126.16s)]
*  become the next Ukraine. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4131.92s)]
*  Don't let the US create a disaster in your neighborhood. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4134.4s)]
*  The worst words from the United States are we have your back. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4139.5599999999995s)]
*  That's what we told the post coup government of Ukraine in 2014. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4143.64s)]
*  That is 600,000 dead. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4150.48s)]
*  Caused by that kind of idea. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4155.04s)]
*  So I tell my Taiwanese friends, take a deep breath and don't be provoked into something [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4158.72s)]
*  extremely dangerous, because there are hotheads in the United States that want to provoke [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4166.5199999999995s)]
*  and that shouldn't be provoking and that provoke completely against our own diplomacy. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4173.36s)]
*  Now, in 1982, the US and China signed a communicates. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4180.44s)]
*  Very important people can go online and look it up. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4186.0s)]
*  And it was a statement by the United States that said we have no intention to arm Taiwan [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4189.4400000000005s)]
*  for the long term. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4196.72s)]
*  We are providing arms for Taiwan now because historically we backed Taiwan, but now we [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4198.52s)]
*  have established diplomatic relations with PRC. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4204.28s)]
*  But we have no intention of doing this for the long term. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4207.16s)]
*  In fact, we will taper off our arms support for Taiwan and it will come to an end. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4211.12s)]
*  That was 1982. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4219.360000000001s)]
*  That's like so many things the United States promises and then reneges on. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4221.64s)]
*  It's essentially the same as the promise that was made to Gorbachev and to Yeltsin in 1990, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4227.56s)]
*  91, 92, that NATO would never enlarge. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4235.360000000001s)]
*  In other words, we say things, we sign documents, we make communicates, but we regard them as [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4239.16s)]
*  opportunistic moments because we want our complete freedom of action. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4249.76s)]
*  In my view, our smart diplomacy would be very straightforward. [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4256.24s)]
*  We would not have what we call strategic ambiguity, which is a term that is so wrongheaded in [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4262.88s)]
*  my view, but it is meaning we won't say what we'll really do about Taiwan and what we [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4272.96s)]
*  really feel will keep the other side guessing. [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4280.8s)]
*  Why? [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4285.68s)]
*  So that we have an accidental nuclear war? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4286.16s)]
*  What do we want them to guess about exactly? [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4288.4800000000005s)]
*  What I would like us to say very clearly is, of course, we support a one China policy. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4293.16s)]
*  We will not arm Taiwan over the opposition of Beijing, not only because it's one country [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4300.92s)]
*  and we should not arm parts of another country over the opposition of the government that [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4308.68s)]
*  we recognize, but we understand it's incredibly provocative to do so. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4315.64s)]
*  But on the other side, we and the world community expect China, the government in Beijing and [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4321.2s)]
*  the government in Taipei, in Taiwan, to work amicably so that there is no military attack [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4332.8s)]
*  by China on Taiwan and there is no reason in the world why they would do so. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4344.4800000000005s)]
*  If it's understood that it is one China and it's a matter of working things out. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4351.04s)]
*  What about the argument you often hear that Beijing wants Taipei because of TSMC, because [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4356.84s)]
*  of semiconductors that the world needs that AI will need in order to become a driver of [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4363.2s)]
*  the new world economy, et cetera, et cetera, but that that's the prize, semiconductors [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4368.88s)]
*  in Taiwan and we cannot allow mainland China to have them. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4373.360000000001s)]
*  Well, so many things. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4376.92s)]
*  First, that supply chain will not be disrupted by the mainland for us and our needs as long [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4380.64s)]
*  as we don't provoke a war. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4393.12s)]
*  So from one point of view, we have a circumstance in our country that we design advanced [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4394.6s)]
*  microchips, but we don't produce them. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4406.36s)]
*  And that was a decision that went back to the 1970s where we basically decided as a [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4408.679999999999s)]
*  matter of policy, not just at the industry level, but at the national political level, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4415.839999999999s)]
*  that we would outsource production to Korea, to Japan. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4421.28s)]
*  And then in Taiwan, this came from a very clever person, Morris Chang, who established [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4427.04s)]
*  the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, TSMC. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4433.92s)]
*  So nothing about TSMC per se is at stake in this. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4437.96s)]
*  Actually, it is the case right now that the US is imposing sanctions on TSMC exporting [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4447.6s)]
*  advanced microchips to China. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4455.68s)]
*  I don't support that policy at all. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4459.280000000001s)]
*  I think that the idea of doing it is wrongheaded and provocative and not actually in [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4462.88s)]
*  anybody's interest. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4470.36s)]
*  It's part of the US misguided attempt to, quote, contain a country that is larger, very [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4471.44s)]
*  clever, technologically sophisticated, and will engineer around these restrictions in [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4481.48s)]
*  short order. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4488.32s)]
*  And that's my guess of with our technology export bans, we're not really accomplishing [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4489.0s)]
*  anything except speeding up China's ability to innovate around any of the US bans. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4495.16s)]
*  So I don't see TSMC as really an important part of this story. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4505.04s)]
*  There may be people who do. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4512.2s)]
*  I think they're wrong. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4513.84s)]
*  I believe, and that's the point I'm trying to make, if we don't provoke, if we treat [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4515.4400000000005s)]
*  China as we should, as another great power, as, by the way, a really great civilization [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4521.52s)]
*  with lots of wisdom and lots of history and lots of beauty and lots of culture and lots [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4530.360000000001s)]
*  that can be shared with us as a great manufacturing power, but not one that is out to go [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4536.76s)]
*  conquer the rest of the world because China is not. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4544.56s)]
*  We will have perfectly fine relations. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4548.72s)]
*  China will continue to develop. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4551.4400000000005s)]
*  Interestingly, I think people should understand China is now a larger economy than the [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4554.76s)]
*  United States, but not in per capita terms. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4559.280000000001s)]
*  It's still around a third of the US per capita income level. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4562.64s)]
*  So it's not as if we're facing some, you know, impossible, you know, threat that is [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4567.2s)]
*  about to overtake the United States. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4575.400000000001s)]
*  They're just trying to catch up for lost time. [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4577.8s)]
*  They're trying to develop. [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4580.72s)]
*  They're doing an excellent job of it. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4581.88s)]
*  They're very clever. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4583.88s)]
*  They're working very, very hard. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4584.8s)]
*  They're working very long hours. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4586.36s)]
*  They're saving and investing a lot. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4587.92s)]
*  They're building a modern economy and all credit to them. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4590.36s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, they're they're doing it the right way, saving investment, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4594.32s)]
*  education, innovation and and catching up, which they needed to do after a really [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4599.8s)]
*  horrible 150 years. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4607.8s)]
*  Basically, we want to announce something big that we've been working on for months now. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4610.2s)]
*  It's a documentary series called Art of the Surge. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4613.96s)]
*  It's all behind the scene footage shot by an embedded team that has never before seen [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4617.08s)]
*  footage of what it's actually like to run for president. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4622.92s)]
*  If you're Donald Trump, they were there at the Butler Township assassination attempt, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4625.72s)]
*  for example, and got footage that no one has ever seen before. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4629.8s)]
*  And it's amazing. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4632.76s)]
*  Become a member at Tucker Carlson dot com to see this series, Art of the Surge. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4634.12s)]
*  So I'm everything you've said for the last I don't even know how long we've been [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4640.2s)]
*  sitting here, but last hour and a half or whatever, hour and 20 it's been. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4644.12s)]
*  I've never heard on NBC's CBS Red New York Times. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4648.2s)]
*  I mean, these are all ideas and perspectives that are just missing from big media outlets [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4654.599999999999s)]
*  in the United States. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4660.599999999999s)]
*  You've been banned from those outlets after spending a lifetime on them. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4661.48s)]
*  So the only reason that we're able to have this conversation is because we're doing it [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4666.76s)]
*  on social media, on alternative media. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4670.48s)]
*  It seems to me that if you're running a regime, a government that has really unpopular [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4672.72s)]
*  and destructive policies, you have to shut down these kinds of conversations. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4679.92s)]
*  We just saw Pabl Jerev, the founder and owner of Telegram, jailed in France. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4684.76s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4689.16s)]
*  It is unbelievable, but it's also believable. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4689.84s)]
*  No, but it's so crude and so disgusting and so dangerous, of course. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4693.16s)]
*  So, but it also strikes me as like a herbinger. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4698.88s)]
*  I mean, that's that looks like the future to me. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4703.360000000001s)]
*  What do you I mean, will there be a free exchange of information 20 years from now? [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4705.52s)]
*  It's a big question. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4714.28s)]
*  You know, I was on a show with someone that I've liked and known and you know him as well [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4715.84s)]
*  and that I've admired for decades. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4726.48s)]
*  Dimitri Simes, who's a Russian American who lives sometime in the United States, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4729.08s)]
*  sometimes in Moscow. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4736.4s)]
*  He was a young advisor to Richard Nixon, who, by the way, had a lot of intelligent ideas [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4739.48s)]
*  about relations with China and relations with Russia that I admire more and more in [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4748.16s)]
*  retrospect as well. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4756.16s)]
*  But Dimitri Simes home was raided by the FBI. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4760.28s)]
*  And I found it especially unnerving because I was on a show by Zoom, his talk show, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4766.96s)]
*  very serious discussions about how to avoid nuclear war, the kinds of things we're [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4777.16s)]
*  talking about. And they're raiding his house. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4782.2s)]
*  And of course, we're seeing more and more of that all over the United States. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4785.16s)]
*  We know you know much more about it than I do. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4790.32s)]
*  But we know and your phenomenal interview with Bobby Kennedy also explained a lot of [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4792.88s)]
*  it. How much is being shut down on the social media, how the government basically leans [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4799.68s)]
*  on our leans on platforms that are trying to get some normal discussion going on? [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4807.76s)]
*  I don't know how much I'm supposed to say about it, but I think I can say that one of [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4819.64s)]
*  my favorites, Judge Napolitano, who I discussed these issues with, had his YouTube [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4826.16s)]
*  account closed for a week because of something that a guest said that suddenly they told [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4836.72s)]
*  him that's one strike. [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4845.4800000000005s)]
*  Do that again. That's two strikes. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4847.280000000001s)]
*  If it happens the third time, you're off permanently. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4849.12s)]
*  This is a weird, dangerous situation we have in our country, which was founded on the [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4852.2s)]
*  principle that there is a marketplace of ideas, that you discuss things, that that if [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4858.76s)]
*  you want to have a free country, you need to inform citizenry. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4863.72s)]
*  It's it's absolutely fundamental and it is completely at risk right now. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4867.68s)]
*  If you can be punished for criticizing a regime, isn't that regime by definition a [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4874.6s)]
*  dictatorship? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4878.76s)]
*  We are in any event. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4880.240000000001s)]
*  It has to be understood. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4883.64s)]
*  The American people have only the slightest say and slightest knowledge about what our [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4885.8s)]
*  government does abroad. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4892.24s)]
*  The American people have more knowledge to some extent about what it does at home. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4894.639999999999s)]
*  But what it does abroad has been deliberately made highly secret and confidential for [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4899.92s)]
*  decades. And so some of it is obvious and in broad daylight, but all denied when it [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4910.16s)]
*  does it. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4918.44s)]
*  I talked about the US role in the coup in Ukraine in February 2014. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4919.36s)]
*  That is a covert regime change operation, according to the technical jargon. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4926.16s)]
*  We do that for a living. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4932.28s)]
*  This is how the US operates. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4934.759999999999s)]
*  Dozens and dozens of overthrows of foreign governments. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4936.88s)]
*  I've seen many close up because I'm an economic adviser. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4941.44s)]
*  I'm not a military adviser, but presidents say things to me or I see with my own eyes [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4946.52s)]
*  these occurrences. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4953.160000000001s)]
*  But none of it shows up in our domestic discourse. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4954.6s)]
*  That's why that permanent state machine runs on its own to a large extent and why it [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4961.8s)]
*  is the unique job of a president to stop it. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4971.48s)]
*  Because I regard the job of a proper job of a president is to stop the war machine. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4975.799999999999s)]
*  It's the number one job. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4982.679999999999s)]
*  If you have a president that's not mentally competent, and I think that's probably the [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4984.88s)]
*  situation with Biden right now, or not a very clever president, which may have been the [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4988.84s)]
*  situation before with Biden or one who was bought into the military industrial complex, [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4993.719999999999s)]
*  they don't even know what their most basic job is. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=4999.64s)]
*  So whether it's through laziness or being pushed or being lied to by aides or being [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5002.280000000001s)]
*  of that mindset or being of no mindset, we are a war machine. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5012.68s)]
*  And that is not known by the American people. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5017.4400000000005s)]
*  So the famous Eisenhower retirement speech, which I just watched last year. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5023.08s)]
*  Well addressed January 17th, 1961. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5029.56s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5034.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm almost sure that's the date. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5035.080000000001s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5036.76s)]
*  I'm almost sure. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5037.320000000001s)]
*  I've often heard it referred to, but I've never, it's on YouTube. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5038.120000000001s)]
*  I watched it one day on the treadmill and I was really struck by it. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5042.4400000000005s)]
*  It's much more intense than it is given credit for being. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5047.320000000001s)]
*  But he seems to suggest this began with the war, the Second World War. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5051.4800000000005s)]
*  Do you think that's right? [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5055.64s)]
*  Well, it began with the National Security Act of 1947. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5057.080000000001s)]
*  It began with the creation of the CIA and the empowerment of the CIA to engage in [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5064.120000000001s)]
*  blatantly illegal, vulgar activities, of course, including assassinations of foreign leaders, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5074.52s)]
*  overthrows of foreign governments, and to do so on a completely secretive way. [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5084.5199999999995s)]
*  And with an agenda, of course, the agenda, which even predates 1947. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5090.679999999999s)]
*  It goes back to 1945. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5097.96s)]
*  And by some accounts, even earlier, was that the CIA was the instrument to confront the [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5100.44s)]
*  Soviet Union, to defeat the Soviet Union, to overthrow the Soviet Union, to dismantle [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5107.879999999999s)]
*  the Soviet Union, but that it was the instrument of our, we used to call it the war on communism, [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5113.32s)]
*  but what's interesting is that after communism ended, the war on Russia continued exactly [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5122.759999999999s)]
*  the same way. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5128.2s)]
*  So it's not really about communism. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5128.759999999999s)]
*  Apparently not. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5130.92s)]
*  It's really about a big country that the US resents for being a big country. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5132.12s)]
*  That's basically what this is about. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5139.16s)]
*  The US does not like peers. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5141.0s)]
*  And that was especially the idea of why should we have peers? [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5145.08s)]
*  We need full spectrum dominance. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5148.52s)]
*  We need to run things. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5151.48s)]
*  We need to be the indispensable country. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5153.08s)]
*  We need to be the world's only superpower. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5155.08s)]
*  It's quite a vision. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5158.52s)]
*  It gets you into a lot of trouble because most of the rest of the world doesn't see things [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5160.36s)]
*  the way you do. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5165.96s)]
*  But that goes back to especially the institutional creation of the CIA because the precursor, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5167.08s)]
*  the OSS, was doing things during World War II. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5177.08s)]
*  Okay, we were in a world war, but that kind of covert operation continued and it became [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5180.28s)]
*  a cornerstone of American foreign policy, but it means completely secret. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5190.6s)]
*  But it sort of took over the whole government, though. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5197.400000000001s)]
*  By being completely secret, you can do things that are absolutely unbelievable. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5199.88s)]
*  And I think you believe, but I certainly believe that the CIA had its role in the coup in the [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5205.96s)]
*  United States in 1963, which was the assassination of President Kennedy. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5214.280000000001s)]
*  I think that's confirmed. [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5219.0s)]
*  I mean, it was confirmed by me, by someone who saw the documents. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5220.12s)]
*  The implications of that are so profound. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5224.2s)]
*  Not only was it a murder most foul, as Bob Dylan said in that incredible song that he [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5227.0s)]
*  wrote about it, but it in a way marked the end of our democratic institutions because [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5239.56s)]
*  the presidents after that, maybe they are afraid for their lives. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5248.28s)]
*  Maybe they are absolutely paralyzed. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5253.96s)]
*  Maybe the CIA got away with something so extraordinary, a murder in broad daylight with plenty of [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5257.719999999999s)]
*  eyewitnesses that pointed out there was a conspiracy underway because shots were coming [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5265.0s)]
*  from different directions. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5271.16s)]
*  They got away with a narrative that was so absurd, so shoved down our throats that nobody [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5272.84s)]
*  believed it, but it didn't matter. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5283.56s)]
*  And now it's 61 years later, so who talks about it? [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5285.4800000000005s)]
*  It's a footnote. [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5288.92s)]
*  So maybe they learned, oh, we can get away with everything, including regime change [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5290.68s)]
*  in our own country. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5294.68s)]
*  Well, what do you think of the attempted assassination of Trump? [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5295.72s)]
*  We don't know the story. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5299.08s)]
*  It's absolutely shocking. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5300.2s)]
*  We don't know the story. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5303.96s)]
*  And whether we ever will know the story is like so many other things right now that are [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5305.32s)]
*  huge events. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5311.88s)]
*  We talked briefly about COVID. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5313.64s)]
*  I think it came out of a lab. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5316.92s)]
*  That's one of the biggest events in history. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5318.599999999999s)]
*  Oh, that's so passe. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5320.44s)]
*  Who wants to talk about that anymore? [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5321.5599999999995s)]
*  Assassination attempt on Trump. [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5323.5599999999995s)]
*  Isn't that weeks ago? [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5326.12s)]
*  That's old news. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5327.32s)]
*  We don't even talk about that anymore. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5329.24s)]
*  Blowing up Nord Stream, some cockamamie story. [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5331.24s)]
*  Yeah, a few people in a sailboat. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5334.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, it was Ukrainians. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5336.44s)]
*  Oh, it was this. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5337.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, it was, you know, this is part of it. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5338.28s)]
*  We have no attention span. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5340.599999999999s)]
*  We have complete lying from the government. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5342.599999999999s)]
*  We have secrecy and confidentiality. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5345.16s)]
*  So we never actually resolve any of these issues because it's very hard to have a [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5347.8s)]
*  systematic methodical discussion where one discusses and then where there's a response. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5354.6s)]
*  The thing that gets me about Washington is they don't feel they have to respond to anything. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5362.68s)]
*  And you watch the spokespeople, Matt Miller at the State Department or Kirby in the White House, [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5371.320000000001s)]
*  they smirk right in your face to tell you, you are nothing. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5378.2s)]
*  We can tell anything to you. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5385.24s)]
*  Do you understand? [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5387.0s)]
*  I mean, that's my interpretation. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5388.12s)]
*  I agree. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5389.64s)]
*  They smirk. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5390.5199999999995s)]
*  The contempt they have for the people who pay their salaries who own this country is shocking. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5391.72s)]
*  The salary they pay, can't they get the smirk off their face? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5396.04s)]
*  It would be like getting spit at by your housekeeper. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5399.64s)]
*  No, this is- [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5402.28s)]
*  I'm sorry, you're fired now. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5402.68s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5403.88s)]
*  Exactly you see it. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5405.400000000001s)]
*  They have the little laugh at the end. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5409.8s)]
*  So it's the carefree lie. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5411.8s)]
*  But we're talking about absolutely essential issues. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5415.400000000001s)]
*  And that's what's missing in our discussion right now. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5420.280000000001s)]
*  And it is closed down systematically if you try. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5424.200000000001s)]
*  You just can't discuss the things. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5432.200000000001s)]
*  Can I just take it back? [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5433.88s)]
*  I have trouble staying on track as well. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5435.72s)]
*  There are so many questions, but just back to Durov, Pavel Durov, jail in France right now. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5437.160000000001s)]
*  Is there any chance the Macron government arrested him without coordination from [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5443.56s)]
*  the Biden administration? [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5449.8s)]
*  Probably not. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5451.4800000000005s)]
*  I think the network that people should understand, again, this is, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5452.52s)]
*  it's not exactly out there to go read off the shelf how it works. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5457.56s)]
*  The intelligence agencies are a network in and of themselves. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5463.64s)]
*  So whether Blinken knew about this beforehand, I don't know. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5470.200000000001s)]
*  Did the CIA know about this? [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5474.360000000001s)]
*  Far more likely. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5476.68s)]
*  It's interesting when you look, for example, at negotiations, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5478.4400000000005s)]
*  these endless, hopeless negotiations on a ceasefire in Gaza. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5483.400000000001s)]
*  Hopeless, by the way, because of Israeli absolute lack of interest in a ceasefire, [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5488.92s)]
*  just to say that. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5496.12s)]
*  But when you look at when the negotiations take place, who goes? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5497.56s)]
*  You would think it might be our diplomats. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5502.12s)]
*  No, it's the CIA and Mossad. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5504.68s)]
*  It's a little weird. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5508.52s)]
*  Those are quote unquote intelligence agencies. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5509.96s)]
*  They're doing the negotiations. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5513.8s)]
*  That part's not hidden because you have to say, OK, Mossad and the CIA and Hamas. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5515.48s)]
*  As if it's its own government. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5522.44s)]
*  As if it's the leader of our foreign policy. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5524.5199999999995s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5527.719999999999s)]
*  I thought CIA was by charter an intelligence gathering agency. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5528.36s)]
*  By charter, it is two things, by the way, literally by charter. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5532.679999999999s)]
*  It is an intelligence gathering agency and it is any other mission. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5536.599999999999s)]
*  That is exactly how it became the covert operations enterprise. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5542.28s)]
*  And one more thing I think that is worth pointing out, by the way, about CIA, [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5549.88s)]
*  because we should take note of it. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5554.84s)]
*  There has been one and only one congressional review of the CIA, [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5557.16s)]
*  and that was 49 years ago. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5564.92s)]
*  1975. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5567.48s)]
*  Next year will be the 50th anniversary of the Church Committee. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5568.44s)]
*  Maybe President Trump and Vice President Vance, if they're in power, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5574.04s)]
*  maybe they would call for another congressional investigation. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5579.08s)]
*  Trump, in his intro of Bobby Kennedy on this past Friday, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5580.919999999999s)]
*  when Kennedy endorsed him, said that he would like a commission [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5586.28s)]
*  to look into the CIA's involvement or look into the Kennedy assassination. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5590.919999999999s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5595.16s)]
*  It was a very strange confluence that allowed that one time for the CIA [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5597.0s)]
*  to be looked into because Nixon had resigned, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5603.88s)]
*  Ford was president but had come directly from Congress. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5608.5199999999995s)]
*  And so Ford had this sense in 1975 that he wasn't directly elected president [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5613.48s)]
*  and he respected Congress because he really came from Congress. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5621.72s)]
*  So he actually told his chief of staff, who was Dick Cheney, [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5625.48s)]
*  let this happen, you know, because Cheney was trying to close down [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5631.08s)]
*  church and probably could have closed down the church commission. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5635.24s)]
*  But there was this odd confluence that enabled this tiny moment [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5638.44s)]
*  when the CIA operations could be reviewed. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5643.959999999999s)]
*  When they lifted the cover, it was horror after horror after horror [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5647.799999999999s)]
*  because when church started, he didn't know that he was going to uncover [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5653.24s)]
*  a plethora of assassinations and assassination attempts [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5659.32s)]
*  and mass surveillance of the U.S. public and regime change operations [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5663.88s)]
*  and many other things. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5670.599999999999s)]
*  Well, that cover was put back down, as Bobby said in your interview with him, [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5671.719999999999s)]
*  those committees in Congress that are quote unquote overseeing the CIA [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5678.92s)]
*  are the protectors to make sure that no one looks right now. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5685.4s)]
*  But it's been 50 years, a half a century, [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5689.16s)]
*  since we've had an account of what has really gone on. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5692.84s)]
*  Well, I see things, I don't like what I see and I don't see them [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5697.24s)]
*  because, you know, because somehow it's my area of knowledge or responsibility. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5702.76s)]
*  I see them on the side, like when the president of Haiti told me one day, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5709.4800000000005s)]
*  Jeff, they're going to kill me, they're going to take me away. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5718.04s)]
*  And I said, no, no, no. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5724.04s)]
*  And I thought he was being figurative and metaphorical. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5726.280000000001s)]
*  And I said, no, everything's going to be all right. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5732.28s)]
*  I'm going to help you get this loan. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5734.44s)]
*  Of course, the upshot of it was, as usual, I was naive. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5736.599999999999s)]
*  And they took Aristide out to an unmarked CIA plane one day, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5740.36s)]
*  as president of Haiti and flew him to the Central African Republic [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5747.08s)]
*  and deposed him and deposed him literally in broad daylight. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5750.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, it was the middle of the day and the U.S. Ambassador walked him out [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5754.759999999999s)]
*  to this unmarked plane. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5757.639999999999s)]
*  But the interesting story for me was that I called, [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5759.16s)]
*  since I was an economic advisor a little bit and a friend, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5764.44s)]
*  and don't like presidents getting taken out to CIA unmarked planes [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5769.639999999999s)]
*  and flown to center of Africa, I called the reporter on the beat [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5775.08s)]
*  of the New York Times. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5781.5599999999995s)]
*  And I said to her, could you cover this story? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5783.32s)]
*  There's just been a coup. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5787.24s)]
*  She said to me, my editor's not interested. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5789.4s)]
*  That's my editor's not interested. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5794.5199999999995s)]
*  That's a literal quote because I was, my jaw dropped so stunned, [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5796.92s)]
*  even the phrasing of it. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5803.16s)]
*  But the New York Times would not cover a coup in broad daylight [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5805.0s)]
*  by the CIA in Haiti when it occurred. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5809.48s)]
*  And why do you think that is? [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5814.12s)]
*  Because these are organizations that serve the American power structure [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5816.2s)]
*  and they are both suborned by them because they get their information [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5825.48s)]
*  from the CIA. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5831.48s)]
*  They probably have literal people on staff that are part of the USG [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5832.5199999999995s)]
*  in one way and they, their sources and everything else. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5839.88s)]
*  They view it as patriotic also when the government says [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5845.24s)]
*  not a good thing to handle. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5848.2s)]
*  So they don't view themselves as the defenders of democracy, [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5850.2s)]
*  they view themselves as the defenders of the permanent state. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5855.16s)]
*  And they absolutely do. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5859.56s)]
*  So you think that the intel agencies play a role in shaping news coverage? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5861.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, I think that there's no question at all. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5865.72s)]
*  Some places are just literal mouthpieces of the CIA. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5869.0s)]
*  I don't think anyone doubts that the Washington Post is just the place [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5873.64s)]
*  where you, the CIA issues its statements. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5879.16s)]
*  Sometimes, by the way, helpful because sometimes the intelligence community [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5882.92s)]
*  wants the public to understand something. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5886.68s)]
*  That's right. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5888.84s)]
*  So it's not all wrong or all misinformation. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5889.64s)]
*  No, no, that's absolutely true. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5892.76s)]
*  But of course, that is the place to go to to hear what the CIA says. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5894.36s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal too. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5901.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's not subtle. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5903.08s)]
*  It's not even close. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5905.56s)]
*  What's amazing though is that any counter narrative, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5908.44s)]
*  there's no room for that in any of these papers. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5914.68s)]
*  So then you have the CIA or the whole panoply of agencies, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5918.36s)]
*  but acting not simply as sources, but really as masters. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5923.32s)]
*  Like they're controlling the coverage. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5927.16s)]
*  The idea is, as you know, I think the most important cliched word is the narrative. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5929.0s)]
*  There needs to be a story. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5937.88s)]
*  They control the narrative. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5940.68s)]
*  It's like Orwell told us. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5942.92s)]
*  He who controls the past controls the present, who controls the present controls the future. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5945.4s)]
*  They have to shape the past. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5950.36s)]
*  They have to define everything. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5951.64s)]
*  They need their narrative. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5952.92s)]
*  And that's what these mainstream outlets do is have their narrative. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5954.84s)]
*  They have completely, completely lost the idea of even one time saying, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5963.08s)]
*  well, there's this argument and then there's the argument on the other side. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5971.5599999999995s)]
*  And perhaps having competing columns or trying to understand this. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5975.72s)]
*  I think we talked last time. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5981.88s)]
*  I tried to get 700 words in the New York Times. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5983.96s)]
*  I got up to the point where they actually edited my piece before they killed it, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5987.24s)]
*  but they would not run a 700 word story from someone who knows, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5991.88s)]
*  I think about as much of the about the Ukraine crisis going back for more than 30 years. [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=5997.56s)]
*  I'd say most of the people that write for them and they won't, [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6005.64s)]
*  they're not interested in any other side. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6009.48s)]
*  There's a narrative. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6013.959999999999s)]
*  And so that is how it works. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6015.48s)]
*  The narrative does not have to be believable, by the way. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6017.16s)]
*  Most of the time it's not believed. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6020.5199999999995s)]
*  Russia blew up the Nord Stream pipeline. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6023.16s)]
*  The Warren Commission was not believed by the American people. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6026.5199999999995s)]
*  Most Americans believe that there was a lab leak that caused the pandemic. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6032.28s)]
*  Most Americans, I would suppose, believe that the US blew up Nord Stream or certainly had its [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6038.2s)]
*  role in it. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6046.679999999999s)]
*  So these narratives are not believed, but they buy enough time that the attention goes away [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6047.48s)]
*  and you get onto something else. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6055.08s)]
*  It's just a way to make sure that there's no need to answer anything, no accountability. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6056.679999999999s)]
*  That's what this is about. [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6065.879999999999s)]
*  Not convincing people of outlandishly weird stories. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6066.92s)]
*  The lone gunman who killed President Kennedy when everyone's pointing in another direction and [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6072.28s)]
*  the count of the bullet says something else and blah, blah, blah. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6078.04s)]
*  No, you don't have to believe it, but you need to be able to say something for long enough that [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6081.4800000000005s)]
*  something else comes up and that you stop talking about the previous thing. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6086.84s)]
*  It's extremely dangerous because what it means is that beneath that it's not to convince people, [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6091.96s)]
*  it's to have the ability to do what you want to do and know that you won't be held accountable for it. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6098.84s)]
*  I do think though a wrinkle in the program, a huge problem for the people who've been conducting [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6107.24s)]
*  their affairs this way is alternative media. [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6115.88s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6119.400000000001s)]
*  Which went from being really niche and kind of far out and not credible to being the- [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6120.04s)]
*  It's the only place you can find information. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6125.88s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6128.04s)]
*  Judge Napolitano, for example, who's a really sweet man, lost his last job. [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6129.4s)]
*  I don't know if he's ever said that in public, but I know. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6135.8s)]
*  He's a terrific guy. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6137.96s)]
*  I saw it. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6139.0s)]
*  Absolutely terrific guy. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6139.48s)]
*  He lost his last job for having views on foreign policy that were not consistent with what you [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6140.12s)]
*  were supposed to say. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6145.0s)]
*  He got fired for it. [[01:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6145.8s)]
*  He winds up doing his own little tiny thing on YouTube and all of a sudden it becomes a real thing. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6147.56s)]
*  Yeah, because you talk, you reason. [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6152.280000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6154.360000000001s)]
*  He looks at evidence and you can't find that in what used to be- [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6155.240000000001s)]
*  Rogan's like some sort of MMA fighter comedian sitcom actor just starts doing this little [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6160.360000000001s)]
*  program on something called a podcast and becomes the biggest thing in the world. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6165.88s)]
*  That is just a massive, that's too big a threat. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6170.68s)]
*  Elon Musk making rockets then buys Twitter and then opens it up. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6173.32s)]
*  These are the biggest threats they face. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6179.16s)]
*  They can't allow that to continue, can they? [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6182.2s)]
*  Well, this is Surov. [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6185.16s)]
*  They just arrested Surov. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6186.92s)]
*  Well, that's it. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6187.88s)]
*  Elon is a force of nature, of course, and may be able to face down the USG, but we know [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6189.799999999999s)]
*  and Elon has really been very clear, very brave and doing the right things, but we know that the [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6203.48s)]
*  other platforms are already so heavily policed and with US engagement and we heard about it [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6210.36s)]
*  again from Bobby Kennedy. [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6217.96s)]
*  But we know it also and we saw it with Judge Napolitano also. [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6221.5599999999995s)]
*  Here's the threat. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6227.08s)]
*  You deviate, even a guest deviates from our narrative. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6228.28s)]
*  You got two times, but the third time you're off our- [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6234.68s)]
*  Who is the guest, by the way? [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6238.68s)]
*  The guest was Pepe Escobar, who's a reporter, journalist, provocative, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6239.8s)]
*  and I don't even know the details, but this is the threat and I see it on many YouTube channels. [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6249.0s)]
*  Certain words must not say even if you needed to define something specifically because [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6258.6s)]
*  they'll boot you off and this is already clear now that we're seemingly getting to the next stage of [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6265.88s)]
*  ransacking houses and other kinds of threats. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6275.4s)]
*  It could be that as all of these foreign policy strategies, this hegemonic strategy doesn't work [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6278.6s)]
*  and is unraveling on many fronts. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6292.200000000001s)]
*  Maybe the proponents of that are doing their own kind of escalation to keep things in train. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6296.120000000001s)]
*  The interesting thing is I think there are three main points that we're seeing right now. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6304.92s)]
*  One is the foreign policies of failure. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6310.599999999999s)]
*  It doesn't deliver whether it's fair, unfair, right, wrong, lied. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6313.64s)]
*  It just doesn't work. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6318.44s)]
*  It's gotten the United States into trillions of dollars of failed wars. [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6320.04s)]
*  Everyone can see this. [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6324.2s)]
*  The American people do not back our foreign policy at all. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6325.4s)]
*  That's I think one point. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6329.799999999999s)]
*  Second, we're seeing politicians that are starting to say, no, we've got to do something a different [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6334.12s)]
*  way. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6340.44s)]
*  That's extremely important. [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6340.92s)]
*  Third, we have the truth coming out in these kinds of conversations that even if the so-called [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6342.759999999999s)]
*  mainstream media won't do it, people are tuning in and they're tuning out of the boring [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6354.84s)]
*  tablam narratives that they don't believe of the mainstream. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6361.64s)]
*  That's consequential too. [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6365.96s)]
*  I actually invite you to come talk about the economy since you are an economic advisor. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6367.16s)]
*  Yeah, once in a while. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6371.400000000001s)]
*  But I couldn't resist asking you about the state of the world. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6374.4400000000005s)]
*  The state of our economy, many parts of it, but I'm really fixated on credit card debt [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6377.4800000000005s)]
*  and how high it is. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6382.92s)]
*  Is that it's obviously something to worry about for the people who hold it, but how big a factor [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6384.6s)]
*  is it in the health of the economy? [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6390.2s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6391.96s)]
*  Why is it so high highest ever? [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6392.84s)]
*  Well, I think the main thing to understand about our economy is that for the last 40 years or so, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6395.56s)]
*  we've had two economies. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6402.52s)]
*  We've had an economy of college grads and professionals who have done quite well and [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6403.88s)]
*  we've had an economy of high school grads and working class that have really had a hard time [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6412.68s)]
*  and they have a lot of debt and they have a lot of difficulties. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6420.04s)]
*  We've had basically two worlds in our one nation that don't communicate very clearly with each other [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6424.200000000001s)]
*  and that's our basic economic reality. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6433.240000000001s)]
*  And so that means that things like, we know that and many surveys, Fed data, [[01:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6437.4800000000005s)]
*  which collects this kind of information has looked at it. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6447.56s)]
*  How many people in this country could not manage a sudden $400 emergency, [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6451.240000000001s)]
*  whether it's dental or some medical or prescription or something. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6458.6s)]
*  Proctires. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6461.96s)]
*  And it's a huge proportion of the country. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6463.320000000001s)]
*  And if in my neck of the woods, it's not even known in a sense because I live in a world of [[01:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6466.52s)]
*  people who are earning good incomes and where things look completely different. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6479.88s)]
*  I mean, I'm aware of it because I've written about it for decades and said, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6487.88s)]
*  this is our challenge and our real problem and we don't face up to it, but that's the reality. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6492.68s)]
*  So the credit card debt is not the professional class out on big binges. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6500.36s)]
*  It's people trying to make ends meet and can't necessarily put food on the table for the family, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6505.4s)]
*  can't face a medical emergency of which we have a rising number of part of our population [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6512.44s)]
*  that is experiencing that. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6518.84s)]
*  And that's our real situation. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6520.84s)]
*  We don't deal with it. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6523.64s)]
*  We don't talk about it very clearly. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6525.64s)]
*  Clearly our politics has in a more and more clear way organized along this lines. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6527.64s)]
*  And the irony is the Republican Party became the party of the working class and the [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6536.12s)]
*  and the Democratic Party became the party of the professionals. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6541.96s)]
*  And that was a kind of flip over time. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6549.48s)]
*  But the reasons are complicated, but the basic point is that when these divisions started [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6552.28s)]
*  back in the 1970s and then really evolved after that, nothing happened in this country. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6563.56s)]
*  And so working class voters who were voting for the Democrats in the Franklin Roosevelt era [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6575.8s)]
*  through Kennedy and Johnson felt more and more, well, this party doesn't do anything for us. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6584.04s)]
*  And Trump, obviously, with great political savvy, saw his entree into that in 2016, [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6591.72s)]
*  understood that reality and took the working class out of the Democratic Party, basically. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6601.0s)]
*  But the underlying economics of that is a country that just spread apart. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6609.4s)]
*  It's got many different aspects of it, but the biggest divide in our country is [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6618.2s)]
*  educational attainment, because basically that's the underlying organizing principle [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6623.0s)]
*  for almost the whole economy, which is university graduate and up, you're doing well, [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6630.44s)]
*  your incomes are going up, you're enjoying life, high school, and less, you're struggling. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6636.759999999999s)]
*  And it shows up in so many places, it shows up in housing, it shows up in credit card debt, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6644.84s)]
*  but it actually shows up in life expectancy, which is unbelievable. [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6651.16s)]
*  There's an eight-year gap of life expectancy between high school grads who have a life [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6655.56s)]
*  expectancy of around 75 and college grads who have a life expectancy of around 83. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6662.76s)]
*  Can you imagine? This is two different societies, and to the point of how long you live, [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6670.52s)]
*  how you live, whether you're healthy or not, and this has been going on for decades now, [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6679.72s)]
*  and completely, almost, un-understood and unaddressed, and the political system [[01:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6685.8s)]
*  more or less incapable of solving anything, unfortunately. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6694.68s)]
*  It's interesting, though, how little anyone cares. I think these are complicated problems, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6698.44s)]
*  very complicated problems, you suggested. I'm not exactly sure how to solve it, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6704.36s)]
*  but I know that the first step is acknowledging it and caring about it. [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6708.679999999999s)]
*  And discussing it. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6712.36s)]
*  Discussing it. And you've been in, at least since you were an undergraduate at Harvard, [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6713.4s)]
*  in one world. I have two. And so I can verify, I know you can as well, that there's no conversation [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6716.839999999999s)]
*  about this, that everyone in the world that I grew up in blames the people who were dying earlier. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6723.08s)]
*  Hates them for it, hates them for their weakness and their suffering. That just strikes me as such [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6728.679999999999s)]
*  an ugly, vicious impulse. I don't understand it. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6732.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great observation. You know, you really can close the gates, literally, [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6737.0s)]
*  on gated communities, but even if the community's not gated, we are segregated by residential area, [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6742.36s)]
*  by cities, by where we live, by rent, by cost of housing, and so on. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6749.799999999999s)]
*  And so you can go on like this without any real attention. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6755.72s)]
*  And certainly, I think it's right to say that the lucky part of our society is more or less [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6766.360000000001s)]
*  insulated, not only by how they live and where they live, and they get nice services from [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6776.280000000001s)]
*  people who are working extraordinarily hard for extraordinarily low incomes, but the political system [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6783.64s)]
*  is paralyzed. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6791.4800000000005s)]
*  But even the social, so we grew up in a country, you're a little bit older than I am, but we grew [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6792.4400000000005s)]
*  up in roughly the same country. There was an acknowledgement that there were people who were [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6796.52s)]
*  not as well off as you, and that was sad. Now among affluent people, I see only race guilt. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6800.84s)]
*  I see no economic guilt at all. And I think there's, you can believe in capitalism or system, [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6807.240000000001s)]
*  or whatever system is, and still feel like, gee, I feel sorry for people who are deep in credit card debt. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6812.28s)]
*  I don't see any of that. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6816.84s)]
*  No, no, this is, I think, exactly right. It's another part that isn't in our discussion, [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6818.759999999999s)]
*  our discourse. And I think it's right to say that basically, the political system doesn't really want [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6826.28s)]
*  to address any of this because it's complicated. You have to pay for solutions one way or another. [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6834.759999999999s)]
*  No one wants to pay for anything. We just run up debt anyway. We run up, if it's not credit card [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6841.0s)]
*  debt, it's our national debt. And anyway, as we've been talking about, we're much more interested in [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6847.72s)]
*  blowing up places and overthrowing other governments than we are in addressing any of these issues. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6855.72s)]
*  What would happen if people stopped paying their, if a lot of people stopped paying their credit card debt? [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6859.96s)]
*  Well, the way that our system works is that it more or less goes along on deep trends, whether [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6864.52s)]
*  technology or other trends, until there's some kind of crisis. We had a crisis in 2008. That was a [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6880.36s)]
*  very particular kind of crisis where a not very clever move by, I think, a not very clever [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6889.24s)]
*  Treasury Secretary at the time decided he would bankrupt a company he didn't like. It was [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6897.0s)]
*  Hank Paulson, who came from Goldman Sachs, not my part of the Sachs family, I need to explain. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6906.679999999999s)]
*  So I just want to be clear, different branch, I suppose. And he didn't like Lehman Brothers. So he [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6913.64s)]
*  decided literally one weekend rather than try to sell off Lehman Brothers, he's going to close it [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6920.4400000000005s)]
*  down. And it was a kind of lame brained operation. And he created one of the greatest financial [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6925.8s)]
*  crises of modern history. Wait, wait, wait. Yes. You think Paulson created the 08 meltdown because [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6932.12s)]
*  he had a grudge against Lehman? Yeah, basically. He wanted to teach them a lesson. He thought they [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6937.88s)]
*  were lazy, terrible firm, which they may well have been, by the way. But he decided in 2008, [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6943.0s)]
*  there was a housing bubble and the housing bubble was breaking. And a lot of the investment banks [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6952.2s)]
*  were on the edge because they had invested in crappy mortgages and that they were trying to [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6958.04s)]
*  securitize. So it was a fragile situation. We would have had a normal downturn for sure. We would [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6966.76s)]
*  have had a recession. But Paulson decided in September 2008 that rather than do another [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6972.36s)]
*  rescue where you take a weak bank and you may add some public money and then you [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6981.48s)]
*  sell it off to a buyer. And there was a potential buyer for Lehman Brothers, it was Barclays, [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6989.0s)]
*  British bank. And the USG government could have put in a bit of money or taken some of the bad [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=6996.28s)]
*  stuff off the balance sheets and given the rest to Barclays. But Paulson wanted to do two things. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7003.719999999999s)]
*  He wanted to teach Lehman Brothers a lesson, I believe. You can't prove this stuff, but Lehman [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7013.24s)]
*  was kind of a rival of Goldman and I think there was that personal bit from what I know. [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7020.44s)]
*  But also Paulson thought, well, we should show the markets, we can be tough and firm and let [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7030.44s)]
*  the markets determine the outcome. So he said, we're not going to do any patch up to get [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7037.4s)]
*  Lehman into somebody else's hands. We're going to just let it close, let it go bankrupt. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7047.64s)]
*  And that was September 14th, 2008. And when the markets opened the next day, [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7052.76s)]
*  he had triggered one of the greatest financial crises of history, actually, within- [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7060.6s)]
*  Why have I never heard the story? [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7066.6s)]
*  Maybe they didn't want to advertise how unbelievably incompetent they were. But this [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7070.04s)]
*  was complete incompetence. And by the way, it was incompetence of the whole economic team. [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7076.28s)]
*  It included the Fed, New York Fed, Washington, the Treasury. This was a crisis that absolutely [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7081.5599999999995s)]
*  was not only human made, but you can pinpoint the hour and the day and the event. Because the point [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7089.639999999999s)]
*  I was making, because you asked me a question about- [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7098.679999999999s)]
*  Sorry, my jaw's open. I mean, I'm kind of interested in the subject. I read a book on it, I guess. And [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7100.679999999999s)]
*  you asked me a question about credit card debt and the point- [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7106.28s)]
*  No, but that's just so interesting. [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7109.08s)]
*  And I was making a digression because- [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7109.88s)]
*  Is this widely, well, I'm digressing again, but is this widely known? [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7111.08s)]
*  It's not very well understood. It's not a secret, but I can explain why it's not understood in a [[01:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7115.719999999999s)]
*  moment. But the point is a financial panic is a specific kind of event. It is the same event [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7125.64s)]
*  as when people are trampled running out of a stadium. So that happens once every, I don't know [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7136.04s)]
*  how many hundred football games, something happens. There's a fight, people start running, [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7143.240000000001s)]
*  and then trampling, and then lots of people get crushed. So that's a specific event. It's a panic. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7148.84s)]
*  In finance, the same thing can happen. And financial panics happen [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7156.04s)]
*  on occasion throughout history, and you can identify them. And usually there is a cause [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7164.84s)]
*  that is a trigger of it. But with a panic, like a stampede out of a stadium, the cause is completely [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7172.360000000001s)]
*  incommensurate with the outcome. In other words, the cause may be that someone punched someone else [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7180.44s)]
*  and that started commotion and that started, and a thousand people got trampled in the end. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7187.96s)]
*  So the cause was some stupid little thing, but then it led to a cascade of disaster. That's exactly [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7194.759999999999s)]
*  what a financial panic is, or a bank run. I don't know if anybody ever remembers my favorite movie [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7201.4s)]
*  of my youth and for my children, Mary Poppins. But Mary Poppins is a children's story, of course, [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7209.080000000001s)]
*  that has a bank run in it, where the young boy wants to get his two pence out of the bank, [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7216.6s)]
*  and there's resistance, and he starts screaming, you won't give me my money back. And then everyone [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7223.400000000001s)]
*  runs to the bank to take their money out and the bank fails. And it's a panic. So Hank Paulson made [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7228.280000000001s)]
*  a panic in September 14, 2008, and he made it deliberately. The action was deliberate, [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7235.32s)]
*  the outcome was not deliberate. He had no idea what he was about to do, which was to create [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7248.04s)]
*  this rush for the exits by all banks on all loans all over the world within three days. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7254.759999999999s)]
*  And that's what he created. And it created the biggest economic downturn [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7261.64s)]
*  since the Great Depression itself. And that's, by the way, an interesting, very interesting [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7267.64s)]
*  story also, because just like a panic can create something that's completely [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7277.320000000001s)]
*  incommensurate with any fundamental reason, but it leads to a total disaster, the opposite can [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7284.6s)]
*  sometimes happen also, which I was reminded because the Great Depression, which was this calamitous [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7293.64s)]
*  event in the days up to Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration, which was March 4, 1933, [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7301.320000000001s)]
*  there was a bank panic in the United States. And by the time that Roosevelt became president on [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7311.0s)]
*  March 4, 1933, the whole U.S. banking system had closed down because everyone had rushed to the [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7317.72s)]
*  banks to withdraw their money, just like in Mary Poppins, but it was all over the U.S. So the whole [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7325.88s)]
*  U.S. banking system was closed when Franklin Roosevelt became president on March 4, 1923. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7332.76s)]
*  And with a smile and a tilt of his head, he said, and I firmly believe that the only thing we have [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7341.32s)]
*  to fear is fear itself. And with those words, people stopped panicking, and they went back and [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7350.44s)]
*  put their money in the bank. And within a few days, the U.S. banking system reopened. And it was [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7360.68s)]
*  Franklin Roosevelt's personality and his spirit and his tilt of the head and his smile and his [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7368.28s)]
*  phrase that it's only fear that we have to fear that undid the panic. After that, many reforms were [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7378.2s)]
*  made, like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the SEC and public reporting, and many things [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7386.28s)]
*  were done, but the banks actually opened on a matter of words. So you asked me a question, [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7395.8s)]
*  why did I make this big digression? Because financial markets are capable of creating [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7402.44s)]
*  all sorts of disasters. And the first rule that you learn is be careful. Don't let liquidity [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7408.12s)]
*  mess you up. Don't let panics destroy things. Hank Paulson apparently didn't know any of that, [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7417.16s)]
*  and he walked the world into a $10 or $20 trillion disaster loss via deliberate action [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7423.4800000000005s)]
*  because there were better ways. That's an absolutely remarkable story, [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7431.4800000000005s)]
*  remarkable because it happened in front of all of us. I was paying, I don't know, 30% attention. [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7435.96s)]
*  I actually had to sell my house that year, so it affected me and a lot of people, [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7441.8s)]
*  maybe less than most. But still, it affected everybody. And he was treasurer secretary and [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7445.96s)]
*  a famous guy, and he's still kind of a famous guy. Yeah, yeah, he still is. No one ever... [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7450.36s)]
*  Probably a nice guy, by the way. Yeah, yeah. I do doubt that, but I don't know. I don't know. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7453.88s)]
*  Trying to let my bigotries affect my view, but why does he not carry the stain of that with him? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7460.12s)]
*  The reason is, strangely enough, people don't understand what I just described in general, [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7466.599999999999s)]
*  though there is a group. I'm a finance economist, so I study this throughout history, [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7475.88s)]
*  and I've studied these events, and I've watched them actually close up because I've often been [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7480.76s)]
*  called into crisis situations. So I'm very attuned to them. And another example, and then I'll give [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7487.0s)]
*  you an answer, was in the summer of 1997, when Asia experienced a full-fledged financial crisis [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7497.4s)]
*  that you may remember, we know it as the Asian financial crisis, what happened? What happened was [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7506.599999999999s)]
*  Thailand devalued the Thai baht. Well, so you want to put your thumb in your mouth and suck your [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7514.839999999999s)]
*  thumb. What difference could that possibly make? It triggered a panic, and the IMF [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7522.12s)]
*  addressed it, the International Monetary Fund addressed it in completely the wrong way, because [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7528.2s)]
*  both the 2008 and the 1997, or the 1933 story that I told you about Franklin Roosevelt, if you're in [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7534.36s)]
*  a stampede or a panic, and you say, you see, you're so immoral, you created this disaster, [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7544.44s)]
*  we are living in sin, this is why our banking system has failed, you will do nothing but crush [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7555.08s)]
*  what you have left standing. But if you say, oh my God, we just had a panic, you don't have to panic, [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7563.08s)]
*  fundamentals are fine, we've got this under control, the only thing we have to fear is fear [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7571.4s)]
*  itself, you can calm down the situation. This is not a matter of math, this is human psychology. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7575.96s)]
*  This is understanding what's going on, and then responding to it in an appropriate way. Now, [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7581.639999999999s)]
*  it happens, and now we're getting really into the weeds of economics. My field is macroeconomics. So [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7588.5199999999995s)]
*  I look at an economy as a whole, and I study business cycles or crises or ups and downs of [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7596.12s)]
*  the economy. So to go back to 2008, we were going to have a recession. A recession means that [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7604.76s)]
*  the people stop buying houses, and there's unemployment, and the unemployment may go [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7614.599999999999s)]
*  from 4% to 7%, and economic growth may turn negative for two or three quarters, and there's [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7622.280000000001s)]
*  a lot of pain, and people can't make ends meet, and so forth. But then the economy recovers in [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7631.88s)]
*  maybe 18 months or so. That's not what happened in 2008. What happened in 2008 was a prolonged, [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7637.16s)]
*  deep crisis with soaring unemployment, with bankruptcies, with mega bailouts, with the [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7644.76s)]
*  whole world economy suffering. There was no reason for that bigger outcome. The normal thing would [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7651.24s)]
*  have been a recession. Why a recession? Because there was too much liquidity and deregulation of [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7660.360000000001s)]
*  the mortgage markets, and there was a bubble, and the bubble burst, and housing went into recession, [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7671.24s)]
*  and we had another business cycle. Okay, that would have been the normal. But we had [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7677.0s)]
*  Hank Paulson on September 14, 2008, pulling the plug on an investment bank that triggered a panic [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7682.5199999999995s)]
*  among all banks, so that by Monday morning, when the markets opened, first there were legal problems [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7691.4s)]
*  in Britain, because Lehman had a branch in Britain that under British rules created lots of problems, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7698.6s)]
*  but then the investment banks started to call in their loans because they said, oh hell, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7707.400000000001s)]
*  all hell's breaking loose, and the stampede started. That led to the mega downturn. So then you ask, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7712.4400000000005s)]
*  well, how was this interpreted afterwards? Because that's your question. Why isn't this standard? [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7719.72s)]
*  Well, the answer is that it was all explained as the downturn from the housing bubble, [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7726.68s)]
*  not the panic caused by the bankruptcy of Lehman. So in other words, what would have been a normal [[02:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7736.2s)]
*  downturn became the narrative for what was the calamitous crisis. In other words, it was [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7744.84s)]
*  mis-explained, and that's how they like to explain it, because Hank Paulson did not want to stand up [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7754.12s)]
*  the next day and say, oh shit, I really did that wrong. That was a stupid thing to do. I didn't [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7762.36s)]
*  understand how financial markets work, even though I had been the lead of Goldman Sachs. I really [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7770.28s)]
*  messed these things up. Ben Bernanke at the Fed did not want to say, my God, that weekend we really [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7776.599999999999s)]
*  should have buffed this up to get it out to Barclays. He said afterwards, I couldn't have sold it [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7783.16s)]
*  anyway. I didn't have the legal authority. Then a scholar at Johns Hopkins wrote a long book explaining [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7790.28s)]
*  very carefully, yes, Ben, you could have done it differently. We could have avoided this crisis. [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7796.84s)]
*  It could have been sold to Barclays. You had all the authority in the world to do it, and so on. [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7802.12s)]
*  The narrative that I'm giving, the explanation that I'm giving was hidden from view, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7807.0s)]
*  partly because of confusion, partly because when a crisis happens, you want to blame it on fundamental [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7814.92s)]
*  things. It was easy to say, oh, that mortgage market was a lot of cheating, and there was a [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7824.92s)]
*  lot of cheating, and all the securitization made messes, and so forth. You want to say, oh, if [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7832.6s)]
*  there's a downturn or if there's a panic, it's because you're sinners. That's a normal narrative. [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7839.88s)]
*  No one wants to take responsibility. God, I really messed up. [[02:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7848.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's important to know why things go wrong so you can take steps to prevent them from going [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7853.08s)]
*  wrong again in the same way. Well, it's also, again, this is now really getting into the [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7856.92s)]
*  weeds of my profession, but as a macro economist, I'll just, if anyone's interested, but this is [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7862.52s)]
*  really getting technical, we have a standard theory that we teach at university level about [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7871.72s)]
*  why downturns happen. It's a theory that's attributed to John Maynard Keynes, who was a [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7879.56s)]
*  really great, brilliant British economist that I've learned a whole career from in his writings. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7886.44s)]
*  But John Maynard Keynes wrote famously about the Great Depression, and he said the cause of the [[02:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7895.16s)]
*  Great Depression is this particular phenomenon we call the decline of aggregate demand. The people [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7902.5199999999995s)]
*  stop buying, and that leads to a downturn. So maybe they stop buying houses, so that leads to [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7908.36s)]
*  a downturn. So that's called an aggregate demand shortfall. And the problem is that all [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7914.12s)]
*  subsequent business cycles after John Maynard Keynes then became interpreted through that lens [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7923.5599999999995s)]
*  that he had established because he was such a wonderful personality and such a fascinating [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7931.08s)]
*  writer and thinker that his interpretation of the Great Depression became the standard way to [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7937.64s)]
*  interpret any event that followed afterwards. And my experience, because I happen to have [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7944.6s)]
*  the experience of working in very acute crises like hyperinflations or debt crises or financial [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7954.12s)]
*  panics, which became my thing for a while in my career, I saw, oh, those are really quite different [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7966.44s)]
*  from how Keynes described the Great Depression. These are phenomena of their own right. They're [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7975.5599999999995s)]
*  very particular. A banking panic is not just a decline of demand. It's a panic. We need to [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7983.08s)]
*  understand the panic. Now, I'm not the first to observe that by any means. There's a whole [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7990.04s)]
*  theory and history about this, but it's kind of, I made a comparison 20 some years ago that, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=7994.92s)]
*  because I'm jealous of my wife, she's a medical doctor and an extraordinarily excellent medical [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8003.24s)]
*  doctor, and she would see a patient and do a diagnosis and save the kid because she's a [[02:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8009.4800000000005s)]
*  pediatrician. And I thought, oh God, if only an economist could actually save something, you know, [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8016.68s)]
*  but she did what she was trained to do called a differential diagnosis, which means you see a fever. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8022.52s)]
*  It's not one thing. You have to figure out what's the cause. So I came to understand, you see [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8029.72s)]
*  an economic crisis, you better understand the cause of it, not just the standard narrative. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8037.72s)]
*  And so for me, I'm very much attuned to what really caused that event. Well, Hank, you caused [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8045.4800000000005s)]
*  that event in this case on September 14th, 2008. I'm sorry to say it. Don't want to make it, [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8053.160000000001s)]
*  you know, personal, but you really made a mess at that point. This was not just world markets [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8059.96s)]
*  having their thing. This was something that we made a mistake. You should understand that. [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8066.76s)]
*  So given everything, you know, about the current U S economy and the current, you know, guardians [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8072.6s)]
*  of it, stewards of it, what do you think the next crisis will look like? First, we're in an ongoing [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8078.360000000001s)]
*  crisis, but it's a slow moving crisis. So a crisis doesn't have to be an immediate event. A crisis [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8085.96s)]
*  can be a set of unsolved problems that persist and are difficult. And that I think has been true [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8095.8s)]
*  for a long time. Our economy does not work for half our country. Yes. That to my mind's a crisis. [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8103.72s)]
*  I agree. And it's not news. It's not something that started this year or under the Biden [[02:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8111.4800000000005s)]
*  administration or under any recent administration. It's been decades. Why did it happen? It happened [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8117.72s)]
*  because I think actually this is another long digression, but technology changed and jobs that [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8125.24s)]
*  people used to do good working class high school grad jobs no longer existed. The assembly line [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8132.44s)]
*  ended except for robots. And I toured robotic factories for 30 years. This isn't something new [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8141.08s)]
*  already 30 years ago. I went to a Toyota plant probably. Yeah, probably 30 years ago. There were [[02:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8149.400000000001s)]
*  no people in the whole building. It was a Japanese plant probably in the 1990s, you know, because it [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8157.72s)]
*  was all incredibly sophisticated robots. What I found fascinating about it, by the way, was that [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8163.8s)]
*  every car that was coming off the line was custom, you know, specification. So a truck [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8170.52s)]
*  followed by a sedan, followed by, you know, two seater and so on. The robots were just programmed. [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8180.6s)]
*  They could put together any different thing and the right parts would come in. And it wasn't, [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8186.52s)]
*  you know, super standardized. It was a very sophisticated plant, but it meant that the [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8192.28s)]
*  autoworkers didn't have jobs. So those jobs had already gone away. Jobs in agriculture went away [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8198.12s)]
*  75 years ago. You know, we have 1% of our workforce provides the food for the whole country. [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8205.160000000002s)]
*  And for a lot of the world, 1% because agriculture became so mechanized, so proficient [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8212.76s)]
*  and so on. And when I spoke to a farmer a few years ago, he said, yeah, I still like to ride [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8219.400000000001s)]
*  the tractor. Of course, I read a book when I do because the tractor drives itself. It puts the [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8226.28s)]
*  fertilizer on the field exactly in the right places. Everything is geographically specified [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8231.640000000001s)]
*  and so on. But the point is the fundamental technology of our world changed already 50 years [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8237.640000000001s)]
*  ago, not just with the chat GPT. This is a long ongoing story. And it meant actually high school [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8245.960000000001s)]
*  wasn't going to cut it for demand for workers because what was more than 20% of the workforce, [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8254.84s)]
*  which was manufacturing back in 1980 or so is now less than 10% of the workforce. [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8263.560000000001s)]
*  And that's not by the way, because of China or because of Mexico, that's because of robots, [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8271.800000000001s)]
*  that's because of automation, that's because of digital technologies, that's because of a [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8277.240000000002s)]
*  sophisticated economy. So this trend has been deep. It's been widening for decades. It has led [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8281.48s)]
*  to two societies. The professionals are mainly in cities and they're mainly in the Democratic [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8290.68s)]
*  Party and they're mainly doing rather well, thank you. And the people that are in working class, [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8300.76s)]
*  well, they're in rural areas or semi rural areas or suburban areas in many places and [[02:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8309.32s)]
*  not doing very well. And that's been going on for a long time. And I call that a crisis. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8318.36s)]
*  It's a crisis of our country. What do we do in response? Well, we go to war, we overthrow [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8325.8s)]
*  governments, we do all sorts of things. We call ourselves the greatest country in the world. [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8331.56s)]
*  And we let our infrastructure go to hell. And we didn't address these issues and we didn't face up [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8335.96s)]
*  to the question of how to share better, how to address these challenges in a more effective way [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8342.279999999999s)]
*  or what are we going to do about it? What are the underlying trends? And now we're going to face a [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8350.599999999999s)]
*  new wave with our even more remarkable artificial intelligence, which is actually going to wipe out [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8355.8s)]
*  lots more jobs. And that's going to be a very, very big deal. And this time, a lot of professional [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8370.359999999999s)]
*  jobs, by the way, because, you know, frankly, if I need to find sources or to look at the, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8376.2s)]
*  you know, what's been written about a topic, what used to take me and I was hired to do it, [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8385.720000000001s)]
*  days or weeks to, you know, go through journals and literature and books, I can do in one minute now [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8391.400000000001s)]
*  on, you know, just asking a question to my favorite chat program. And so this is going to cause even [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8399.24s)]
*  more disruptions. It also means, interestingly, of course, that a few people who own these platforms [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8409.640000000001s)]
*  and systems are, you know, getting a wealth that is simply beyond any imagining and any prior [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8418.039999999999s)]
*  experience in the history of the world. I looked up as I was arriving today's net worth of the top [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8428.919999999998s)]
*  10 net worth people of the United States. So with Elon, number one, you know what, [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8439.64s)]
*  or not of the United States of the world, because I think one is foreign, I think maybe of the top 10. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8447.16s)]
*  You know what the 10 richest people, 10 people, just 10, what their net worth is today, [[02:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8454.2s)]
*  $1.7 trillion, 10 people. This is a funny world. You got tens of millions of people who can't pay [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8462.44s)]
*  the bills, can't fill a dental appointment, can't fill a drug prescription. You have 10 people, [[02:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8471.72s)]
*  many of them really creative, by the way. But even if you're really creative, Elon, I think today, [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8479.32s)]
*  I love Elon for lots of things, and know him and admire his genius. But he's got 200 billion [[02:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8487.96s)]
*  something bucks. It's interesting. You know, this is the economy is changing in fundamental ways. [[02:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8497.48s)]
*  And it's bifurcating may not even be the right word. In other words, dividing in two, it may be [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8506.279999999999s)]
*  dividing in even more fractured ways. And we need to figure out what we're going to do about that as [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8512.439999999999s)]
*  a society. And we're not figuring that out. And also, because of the way our political system works, [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8520.28s)]
*  we don't want to do anything that would cost anything because government doesn't accept war. [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8530.68s)]
*  Government doesn't want to raise any revenues, even on people who couldn't use their wealth in [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8537.16s)]
*  a million lifetimes. So we're a little bit stuck. And all of this, the reason I mention all this is [[02:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8547.4s)]
*  that normal economics, the way we discuss this issue is as bad as the way we discuss [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8555.8s)]
*  the wars and everything else. It's at an extremely superficial level that is all about will growth be [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8565.0s)]
*  3.1% next quarter or 2.9% or is the economy in a slow patch or will it pick up? [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8576.599999999999s)]
*  Where the deepest changes of our lives are underway, where technology is transforming [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8587.08s)]
*  everybody's jobs, everybody's lives, where if you don't have the right kind of job, you're living [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8595.88s)]
*  eight or 10 years less than your neighbor that has the right kind of job, that that's the kind [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8604.36s)]
*  of society we have right now. And those are issues that are really important. But where do you discuss [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8610.04s)]
*  them? You're not going to hear about that on the campaign. You're not going to hear about that in [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8619.400000000001s)]
*  almost all of the financial journalism because financial journalism is mainly about what will [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8626.44s)]
*  the markets do? Will the Fed raise interest rates, lower interest rates? Those are not [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8632.36s)]
*  completely uninteresting, but I find them completely boring. So even though that was [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8638.76s)]
*  what I went into to begin with, but I thought of how much fun it would be to turn dials and [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8644.68s)]
*  make economies go up and down. But it turns out to be the least interesting part of the whole story. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8650.2s)]
*  Jeffrey Sachs, I do think at some point you should sit down and figure out 10 stories over the past [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8656.039999999999s)]
*  30 years that have been misunderstood in the public's view of them and just do four hours each [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8665.0s)]
*  as a university lecturer and put them online and just make higher education. As usual, Tucker, great [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8673.16s)]
*  idea. Thank you, Jeff Sachs. I appreciate it. So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8678.44s)]
*  I know. Shocking that in an election year with everything at stake, Google would be putting its [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8690.36s)]
*  thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing anything that the people in charge don't want you [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8696.36s)]
*  to hear. But it turns out it's happening. So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it, [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8702.36s)]
*  but that's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a way around it, [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8706.68s)]
*  a way that you could actually get information that's true. It's not intentionally deceptive. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8711.16s)]
*  And the way to do that on YouTube, we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8717.08s)]
*  and you'll have a much higher chance of hearing what we say. And we hope you will. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsjKZstp-XU&t=8722.44s)]
