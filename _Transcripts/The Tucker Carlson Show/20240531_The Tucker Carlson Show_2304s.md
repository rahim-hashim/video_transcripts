# Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump Jr. Respond to the Trump Verdict
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [May 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc)
*  I used to think, if you asked me like even a year ago, I'd like, well, come on, they're going to roll this guy over, you know, in a gurney, get him over the finish line. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=0.0s)]
*  And I was like, that's no one would believe that the whole premise of their democracy, you know, really relies on people actually still buying it. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=8.4s)]
*  And I don't know that I don't know that they care anymore, because like when they talk about democracy, it's a sound bite, right? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=16.28s)]
*  It's not democracy the way it's not the public they're preserving opposite of what's happening. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=21.16s)]
*  Once they it's almost like you get kidnapped and the kidnapper has a mask on. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=25.92s)]
*  But once he shows you his face, he's got to kill you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=32.04s)]
*  Correct. And they've shown their face. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=34.6s)]
*  Yeah. You know, again, I don't think there's anything they wouldn't do. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you put out something I think it was I think it was on Twitter yesterday, which was, you know, sort of that extreme, like, well, if they can't get Trump this way, what's the next level? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  And I think we've proven that they'll do that in the past. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=47.56s)]
*  They were now figuring that out. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  We understand that. I think the system's probably been broken for much longer than any of us would care to admit. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=53.68s)]
*  And for me, I saw it firsthand. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  At least 61 years has been broken since they killed the president in an election. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Exactly. And for me, I still even when we started this process, even I'd say it's safe to say I was probably the number two target of Russia, Russia, Russia. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=65.6s)]
*  And I was like, well, there must be something to it. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=75.32s)]
*  I know I didn't obviously collude with Russia, but maybe, you know, maybe I took a selfie with an agent once because I took 10,000 selfies a day. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Right. So so, you know, but even like knowing that I was a target, I was like, I still believed I guess I wanted to. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=83.84s)]
*  Right. I want to get it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=91.04s)]
*  America is the greatest place in the world. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=92.12s)]
*  And you can do it. And I'm like, you know, it's the FBI. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=94.0s)]
*  And I, you know, again, there's some door kickers that I'm still like, hey, their home team. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=96.72s)]
*  I get it. They're doing eventually those guys are going to have to speak up, though. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=99.92s)]
*  Right. I gave a long pass. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=102.80000000000001s)]
*  I gave the door kickers a pass for far too long, which is like, hey, you know, they can't go against the leadership. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=104.76s)]
*  But like when you're watching this kind of bastardization of justice, when you're watching this sort of lopsided level, when they're, you know, they spend more time, you know, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  kicking down the doors of an Amish farmer selling unpasteurized milk than actually going after people committing terror because, you know, they're trans or, you know, whatever it is that they are. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=118.88000000000001s)]
*  You really lose that ability to get that pass that I really wanted them to give. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=128.52s)]
*  But, you know, I wanted to believe that everything I grew up believing was accurate. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=133.32s)]
*  And it's all bullshit. It's just all bullshit. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=138.04s)]
*  So we have to fix that. That's that's why we fight now to actually make it so. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=141.68s)]
*  But you saw this on January 6th, too. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=145.52s)]
*  I mean, I know that Joe Scarborough and the rest of the liars presented those people as like insurrectionists and dangerous. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=147.36s)]
*  They were actually the most pure hearted and the most naive about that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=154.44s)]
*  I mean, they were they were literally walking with pocket constitution saying, you can't do this. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=159.92s)]
*  They believed in the system much more than the people who put them in prison who don't believe in it at all. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=163.92s)]
*  Without question. And you saw that. I mean, you know, the narrative was pushed so much. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=168.12s)]
*  The clips that they used were designed to create something that didn't actually happen. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=172.2s)]
*  I mean, it's so sick. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=176.84s)]
*  You know, I will say it was the first unarmed insurrection in the history of insurrection. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=179.48s)]
*  I mean, it's never happened before. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=183.96s)]
*  But arguably, I'd say probably the most heavily armed populace if they wanted to have been. Right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=185.12s)]
*  Of course. But of course, it wasn't an insurrection. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  It didn't matter. And they just wanted to run out the clock. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=192.4s)]
*  They could hardly believe this was happening. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=195.12s)]
*  And I think you're describing the same thing. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=197.16s)]
*  Like, you really believed it in our institutions and our norms and democracy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=199.12s)]
*  I did. And it took again. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=205.28s)]
*  I mean, literally threats of, you know, you're going to jail for treason, a crime punishable by death. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=208.04000000000002s)]
*  That's like not a great swing thought when you're going through it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=212.44s)]
*  You know what I mean? I'm like, wait a minute. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=214.68s)]
*  If you're the father of five kids. Yeah. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=216.04s)]
*  And yet I still at the beginning of it, I was like, and then it just your eyes start to open [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=218.72s)]
*  and you see the games and you see the people that are on your side and you see the, you know, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=224.12s)]
*  the Lindsey Grahams of the world, right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=227.84s)]
*  They they get on TV and they're on, you know, Fox or something like that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=229.28s)]
*  And they're like, well, we must subpoena these people and we must get to the bottom of this. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm like, well, you're like the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=236.72s)]
*  You have you have the authority to do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=239.72s)]
*  Like, like you're talking about doing the thing that you have the authority to do, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=241.84s)]
*  but you're unwilling to actually exercise that power. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=246.76s)]
*  So that was what disgusted me most about like the Republicans. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=249.0s)]
*  Right. It's you're telling your base, the people who are watching, you know, like you're fighting, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=252.36s)]
*  but you know damn well that you're not actually fighting. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=258.28s)]
*  No. Right. And we see that so much. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=260.28s)]
*  That's the difference between the difference between the Democrats. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=261.88s)]
*  I mean, they've shown they'll they'll put their opposition in jail. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=265.64s)]
*  They'll smother them. They'll silence them. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=268.56s)]
*  There's nothing they won't do to preserve power. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=271.0s)]
*  We will write a strongly worded memo and do nothing to follow up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=273.6s)]
*  And I think as long as you have that sort of imbalance in the response, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=278.12s)]
*  nothing changes because, you know, the Democrats, they'll take their win. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=283.52s)]
*  They'll run run to the bank. They'll laugh their ass off along the way. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=286.76s)]
*  And nothing changes until we actually start fighting back. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=289.56s)]
*  I think a lot of people yesterday when that verdict came down, I'm among them. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=292.52s)]
*  My first reaction was, wow, they'll actually hurt us. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=296.8s)]
*  Like they would they would execute us. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=299.68s)]
*  Me, I'll just say, speak for myself. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=302.12s)]
*  And there would be an MSNBC panel of former federal prosecutors telling their audience that I deserved it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=303.84s)]
*  And they'd be laughing. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=308.96s)]
*  The Lincoln Project would send out a, you know, congratulatory tweet. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=310.0s)]
*  And I was like, wow, this there's a sort of a lack of humanity. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  There's a coldness. There's an evil under all of this that I think I underestimate. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=316.56s)]
*  We I think we all did. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=320.88s)]
*  And by the way, I think many still do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=322.4s)]
*  You know, again, it's hard to believe that you could live through these last eight years or whatever, 10 years and and not think that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=324.4s)]
*  I mean, look at, you know, that that this is even, you know, within 10 points in terms of an election. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=331.08s)]
*  Like, I can't name literally a single metric, a single one geopolitical, economic or otherwise, like where we're better off now. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  And yet they'll outrace us. They'll do this. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=346.2s)]
*  The media still pushes it as though, you know, Joe Bidenomics is doing wonderfully for you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=348.67999999999995s)]
*  Like, I get it. I'm the son of a billionaire. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  If I'm pissed off at the grocery store, like, you know, I'm not like one of these woke guys on one of these channels where it's like, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=354.32000000000005s)]
*  my three month old baby was talking about nuclear proliferation on the Carilion Peninsula. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  Tucker. And she was crying. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=363.64000000000004s)]
*  She was scared. It's like, I get it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=366.36s)]
*  Like, I understand where I'm come from. I'm totally comfortable with that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=368.92s)]
*  I've been blessed. But like, if I'm sitting there with sticker shock, like, what's the country feeling? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=371.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, if I see what's going on in my interest rates of my mortgage, like, man, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=376.16s)]
*  how much longer can we do this? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=381.24s)]
*  Then you talk about wars and trillions of dollars of spending. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=382.88s)]
*  And then the Republicans are telling us that, you know, the Ukraine is the number one most important issue for Republicans across our country. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=385.12s)]
*  I've heard that from Mitch McConnell dozens of times. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=390.96s)]
*  It's just not right. I speak in front of I've spoken in front of more Republicans in the last year than Mitch McConnell has in his entire lifetime. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=393.71999999999997s)]
*  And I think I've surveyed probably I do it live, like just at a speech, you know, thousand people here, five hundred people here, five thousand people there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=400.52s)]
*  It's not it's been a top 10 issue in about 60, 65000 people for three people. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=407.6s)]
*  One of them was a D.C. sort of beltway guy. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=413.84s)]
*  He felt very strongly about it. Probably he was profiteering off of it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=418.24s)]
*  One of them misunderstood the question. So he thought it was a double negative. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=421.68s)]
*  So it was not, in fact, a top 10 issue for him because I do it. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=424.48s)]
*  Is it top three or top 10? And one of them, it was top 10, but not top three. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=427.68s)]
*  And I said, sir, you know, and I'll ask him, I don't care. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=431.44s)]
*  You know, I want to hear it out. Like, why is well, I'm from Kiev, Ukraine. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=433.0s)]
*  I'm going to give you a pass. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=436.12s)]
*  So I'm going to effectively say out of about 65000 people surveyed in the last, you know, let's call it two years, 18 months, whatever it is since the war started, a little more, I guess. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=437.6s)]
*  Exactly. You know, basically zero people have been in favor of this. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=446.24s)]
*  But the leader of the Senate will tell us it's the number one issue for Republicans across the country. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=449.8s)]
*  It's just not so. How can that be? I was in D.C. last night. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=453.64s)]
*  And I never go back. I'm from there. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=456.08s)]
*  And I took three people to dinner, four people to the table. Nobody drank for all three. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=458.08s)]
*  I am a tea totaler. So are the other three. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=461.72s)]
*  And it's a good restaurant, but not like a famous restaurant restaurant. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=463.92s)]
*  I've eaten that for many years. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=467.56s)]
*  The bill was eight hundred dollars for four, eight hundred dollars. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=469.12s)]
*  Not drinking, not drinking and no, nothing crazy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=472.4s)]
*  Yeah, like salad, steak, dessert, eight hundred bucks. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=475.32s)]
*  And I thought, you know, I'm pretty insulated from costs, but I thought I can't I can't. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=479.15999999999997s)]
*  How do people live here? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=484.48s)]
*  My experience was opposite of that. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=485.52s)]
*  Took two of my boys on a fishing trip and we were coming back, traveling through an airport and we went to a McDonald's. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  And it was my 11 year old boy, my 14 year old boy and me at the time was the last. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=491.0s)]
*  And it was like forty seven dollars and change for like an 11 year old child, a 14 year old child and me. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=494.56s)]
*  I'm like, again, it's not going to change my spending habits. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=501.0s)]
*  I'm not pretending. I drive it. My truck has 700 horsepower. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=504.28s)]
*  Like, you know, I'm not happy at the pump, but like. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=507.24s)]
*  But if they're telling you the war against Russia is the most important thing to Americans. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=509.88s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's not. They're lying. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=512.72s)]
*  So both of us have sort of skipped ahead past an analysis of the case and sort of taking it [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=514.6s)]
*  as a given that what we saw yesterday was grotesque and really sort of the end of a fair justice system. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=520.44s)]
*  But for people who've just heard that and not gotten some of the details that prove it to be true. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=526.1600000000001s)]
*  Can you just run through what the case was? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=532.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's literally, you know, too much. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=535.08s)]
*  I know. But to the extent how much time we got. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=536.84s)]
*  But, Luria, it's a books and records thing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=540.4000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's literally a filing. It's like a misfiling. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=543.8800000000001s)]
*  And yet it's something that was never before tried as a felony. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=546.92s)]
*  Like many of the other cases, like, you know, one of the cases in New York where they literally they changed New York state law to be able to for one year. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=550.76s)]
*  They changed the law for one year to be able to go back and change a statute of limitations so that you could go after my father. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=559.4s)]
*  And then after that year, after that is filed and they go after my father, that was a G. Carol case. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=564.8s)]
*  It reverts back to the normal statute of limitations because otherwise they wouldn't have been able to do it. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=569.24s)]
*  This was very similar. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=572.72s)]
*  This was a case that was, you know, at best, Mr. Meanor type stuff. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=574.0s)]
*  Remember, Hillary Clinton started with with a similar thing. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=577.8000000000001s)]
*  She got fined eight thousand dollars, I believe it was, for starting what was the Russia Russia Russia hoax with the Steele dossier leaks and all of this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=581.4000000000001s)]
*  Right. That was an eight thousand dollar fine. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=589.48s)]
*  They want to put my father in jail for, you know, upwards of 100 years, depending on how you look at it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=591.0s)]
*  And that's never been done before in these things, because basically someone in an accounting department put legal expenses for, you know, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=595.88s)]
*  paying a lawyer. It's it's unheard of. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=604.76s)]
*  But you have experts when they say, well, it's a federal election crime. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=607.4000000000001s)]
*  They wouldn't let the person who wrote the rules like wrote them is the foremost expert in all of that actually testify for us. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=611.2800000000001s)]
*  The jury didn't have to be unanimous on the things that they charge. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=619.36s)]
*  They just all had to sort of come to a general. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=621.88s)]
*  We have four guys agreed on this and four people agreed on that. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=623.32s)]
*  And that's unanimous. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=625.36s)]
*  The bastardization of all of this thing and it just having been in the courtroom candidly was watching, you know, when the prosecution, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=627.52s)]
*  you know, objected to something that we said, it was always sustained. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=633.2s)]
*  They let them, you know, just we couldn't ask anything when it was us asking the questions, the uncomfortable questions of their witnesses. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=638.8000000000001s)]
*  All of a sudden, you know, we were overruled every time. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=644.96s)]
*  It just the list goes on. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=648.08s)]
*  So you've made the case and others who followed it carefully have made the case that this was a direct hit from the Biden administration. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=650.6400000000001s)]
*  A hundred point to a man called Matthew Colangelo. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Can you tell us who he is? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=659.76s)]
*  Matthew Colangelo was the number three guy in Joe Biden's Justice Department. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=661.5999999999999s)]
*  So from Washington, D.C. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=665.76s)]
*  The other big part of this case, you know, as it relates to that was that they're trying to say it's a federal election commission case. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=667.4799999999999s)]
*  Well, name another case that's ever been tried that's a federal crime tried in a state court. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=673.52s)]
*  So Matthew Colangelo is number three at DOJ. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=678.2399999999999s)]
*  So that's about as high as a prosecutor can ascend. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=680.3199999999999s)]
*  Correct. And he was moved to New York. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=682.76s)]
*  Don't forget, Alvin Bragg, the district attorney that actually tried this case, turned it down years ago. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=684.8s)]
*  They could have done this seven, eight years ago whenever it happened, but they didn't. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=688.68s)]
*  The Federal Election Commission, the FEC, that would have been one of the things that's around it. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=692.2399999999999s)]
*  They could have tried. The IRS could have done these things because if it was a tax thing, all of them chose to pass, including again, Alvin Bragg, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=696.4s)]
*  the guy who's trying and just tried it right now, passed on this a couple of years ago. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=702.4s)]
*  Biden's number three at his DOJ comes up and all of a sudden now they're filing the charges conveniently right before an election. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=706.04s)]
*  Dumb question. So the number three guy at DOJ, who's ascended this ladder. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=713.48s)]
*  Yeah. OK. What is he doing in New York? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=717.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, that's a massive step down. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=723.2s)]
*  He's prosecuting his political enemies, Tucker. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=725.0s)]
*  But that's it. But nobody. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=726.84s)]
*  There's no other. There's literally no other explanation for it. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  When you look at the bastardization of this, you have a judge who's a Biden donor. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=731.84s)]
*  His daughter is one of the number one Democrats. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=736.2800000000001s)]
*  He's literally a Biden donor. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=738.32s)]
*  He's a Biden donor, like literally has written checks himself. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=740.32s)]
*  His daughter is one of the most prolific fundraisers for the radical Democrats. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=742.44s)]
*  Adam Schiff and like she's made millions off of that. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=746.4000000000001s)]
*  This judge allowed his daughter's clients, Democrat mega donors, to sit in the courtroom. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=749.0400000000001s)]
*  It's like having front row seats like you on the New York Rangers. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=754.0400000000001s)]
*  Right. It's think of how insane that is. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=756.12s)]
*  Right. And can I ask a dumb question? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=758.6800000000001s)]
*  First of all, why would the number three guy at DOJ wind up in a case in a state case? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=761.12s)]
*  That seems like he must have been sent. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=766.96s)]
*  One to if the judge was literally a Biden donor and donating to, among other things, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=769.2s)]
*  like the stop Trump effort, which I think was one of them, how could he remain the judge? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=775.5600000000001s)]
*  How could he? Because it's New York. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=780.5200000000001s)]
*  What do you appeal it to? You appeal it to another panicle panel of radicals. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=782.2800000000001s)]
*  Right. I mean, it was like the New York H.E. case. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=785.6s)]
*  Right. We got fined almost a half a billion dollars for paying back a bank on time with interest. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=787.48s)]
*  The bank, who's the alleged victim, is on the stand being like, no, we love Trump. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=795.08s)]
*  We want to do more business with Trump, not less. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=798.4s)]
*  Having their portfolio was a feather in our cap that we used to generate other business. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=800.0s)]
*  Doesn't matter. You're a victim. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=804.84s)]
*  It's pure and simple political prosecution. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=807.28s)]
*  They're going after there's nothing that they won't do to stop Trump. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=811.24s)]
*  And they understand now with years of experience in the White House, I think, you know, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  going in as a novice was great in many ways, but you also don't know who the snakes are. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=819.8s)]
*  You don't know who the people who are going to actually help you and be sort of loyal to the cause. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=823.28s)]
*  And that causes being the duly elected president of the United States, doing the things you said you would do [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=827.72s)]
*  versus doing what the swamp wants, slow rolling what the president wants, all those unelected officials. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=832.64s)]
*  And so I think the notion of Trump coming back now actually scares them so much more because he has that knowledge. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=838.36s)]
*  He has that understanding. And I think that will make him so much more effective in a second term. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=844.6s)]
*  Well, and also, if you're going to kill the king, you better kill the king. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=848.24s)]
*  Yeah. You best not miss, as the saying goes. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=850.8000000000001s)]
*  That's exactly right. So are you worried? [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=852.4s)]
*  Well, a couple of questions. Will this stop the campaign? Like, what effect is that? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=856.84s)]
*  Listen, I spoke to my father right after the verdict today. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=861.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean, you know, obviously, it's a somber moment. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=865.6s)]
*  I mean, you know, you know me well enough. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=868.72s)]
*  I can pretty much, you know, fight through anything and we keep going. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=870.96s)]
*  And he will, too. But, you know, it is a somber moment, more so for our country. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=873.84s)]
*  But if anything, I would say it's actually strengthened his resolve. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=877.8000000000001s)]
*  I think he was in 16. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=882.76s)]
*  It was the elevator ride right before the escalator ride. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=885.04s)]
*  You know, now we find out who our real friends are. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=888.16s)]
*  He knew what was going to happen. He knew the celebrities would go. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=890.4s)]
*  But he knew that and he did it anyway. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=893.04s)]
*  I think after 2020, he understood that if he just went home, he could go play golf [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=895.4s)]
*  and go back to building buildings and making millions and getting paid to give speeches and stuff like that. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=899.56s)]
*  It's just too much at stake. And so he's he's just unwilling to stop. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=904.68s)]
*  I got to think a lot of people are looking back to four years ago and reaching the conclusion, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=908.48s)]
*  well, if they'll rig a trial, they'll probably rig an election. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  I think without question, I think, you know, the reality is, you know, what I see, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=916.84s)]
*  you know, on the ground, the amount of people from the demographics that probably have never voted [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=920.88s)]
*  Republican before that are just, you know, you know, grabbing me at airports or like even walking down the streets, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=925.32s)]
*  you know, in New York the other day. It's it's amazing. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=931.16s)]
*  I mean, I did, for example, I was one of the most out there people in terms of rallies and campaigns doing my own thing in 16 and 20. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=935.04s)]
*  I think, for example, October of 2020, I think I did one hundred and four rallies in that month. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=942.88s)]
*  So like four a day for a month straight. Like I'm on the ground. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, the energy in 2020 was better than even 16, amazingly enough. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=952.04s)]
*  But they they had that ability to weaponize covid and all of that stuff. We saw the nonsense. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=955.64s)]
*  It's so much stronger right now and we're still six months out. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=960.8399999999999s)]
*  That doesn't mean they won't do, you know, again, I don't even pretend to think that, hey, it's going to be fair and they're not going to cheat. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=964.36s)]
*  And they're not. I used to probably think that, hey, there's only so far they can go. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=971.16s)]
*  Like, how, you know, they're going to roll this guy over the line in a gurney and pretend he's because I used to think they actually had [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=974.6s)]
*  maybe a little bit of shame, but that's not actually at all true. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think they care anymore. They're laughing at, you know, when they use democracy, it's a sound bite. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=986.28s)]
*  But they're never laughed about at their cocktail. They're never punished. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=990.28s)]
*  They weren't punished for the Iraq war or the Afghanistan withdrawal or the lies around covid the vaccine mandates. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=992.32s)]
*  They weren't punished for the 2020 election. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=998.36s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. I mean, Russia, not only are they not punished, Tucker, they're they're given better jobs. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1000.08s)]
*  They either keep their job and then they get a CNN contributorship to talk about preserving democracy. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1005.0400000000001s)]
*  But maybe, I mean, if you treated your kids this way, they'd be sociopaths. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1009.44s)]
*  I think you will. Well, they certainly are. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1013.12s)]
*  I'm sure they had boomer parents who indulged them, of course. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1015.88s)]
*  But I mean, someone needs to be punished at some point, right. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1018.36s)]
*  So it stops, I think, without question. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1021.6s)]
*  I don't think we have not done that well. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1023.88s)]
*  Republicans, right. The Democrats don't fear us because they know we'd never play the same game because we actually believe what they think is, you know, ha ha ha sound bite. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1027.0s)]
*  We actually believe those things. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1035.04s)]
*  And it's actually hard. It's hard for me to say those things because I'd love not to have to play that game. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1037.08s)]
*  But I don't believe there's another answer other than like we have to fight fire with fire. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1041.6s)]
*  As long as we're playing T ball while they're playing fast pitch hardball, they're going to win. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1046.2s)]
*  They're going to take their power. They're going to run to the bank. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  They're going to and laugh every step of the way. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1052.72s)]
*  There's just not enough actual fighters there. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1056.64s)]
*  I mean, when you look at even honestly, look at the Republican bench. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1058.72s)]
*  It's not very deep. No. You know, in terms of the guys that you'd actually be. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1062.88s)]
*  Who's the guy I want in a foxhole? Who's the guy that will actually fight? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1065.64s)]
*  Who's the guy that's not going to succumb to the pressures of Washington, D.C.? [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1068.0s)]
*  Who are they? I mean, like right now, I mean, I love a guy like a J.D. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1071.8000000000002s)]
*  Vance. You know, there are a couple, but, man, that list is who's next. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1075.68s)]
*  Mike Lee is kind of becoming that guy. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1083.0800000000002s)]
*  Mike Lee is a fighter. I like Mike. And, you know, and it's interesting. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1085.0800000000002s)]
*  It's one of those in 2016, Mike Lee and I almost got a fist fight on the convention floor. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1087.52s)]
*  Like, you know, we were very different, but like he's a guy that I text with probably daily. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1091.64s)]
*  And so it's interesting that, you know, once you actually have that relationship, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1096.76s)]
*  you can actually people come around. It's like, OK, you were actually right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1099.8s)]
*  Well, people change on the basis of evidence and what they say. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1102.72s)]
*  My views are totally different from what they were 10 years ago. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1105.28s)]
*  I think the problem with D.C. is for conservatives. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1107.8s)]
*  It's actually an easy existence. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1110.76s)]
*  You could be a Republican in D.C. as long as you're Republican light. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1112.36s)]
*  You know, if you're like, hey, say whatever you want. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1115.32s)]
*  When you're speaking to a group of 10 people in your little hometown, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1118.08s)]
*  you know, you come to D.C., you can vote with the Republicans like 80, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1121.76s)]
*  80 percent of the time when it actually matters. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1125.0s)]
*  As long as you vote with us, the Washington Post isn't going to come after you. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1127.24s)]
*  They're not going to be protesting in front of your home. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1131.0s)]
*  It's an easy existence. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1132.92s)]
*  You'll get invited to the cool person Christmas party and, you know, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1134.04s)]
*  sorry, holiday party. I don't want to, you know, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1136.92s)]
*  they don't celebrate Christmas because, you know, because, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1139.6399999999999s)]
*  no, well, because they don't believe in God. Right. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1142.0s)]
*  The Democrats, their gods are evolving. Right. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1144.08s)]
*  Because, you know, Greta Thunberg is the high priestess of climate change. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1146.44s)]
*  Fauci is the, you know, the lord of science. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1150.36s)]
*  Yes. Yes. Science and covid. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1153.68s)]
*  And these days it's Vladimir Zelensky, the, you know, the high priest of Ukraine, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1155.1599999999999s)]
*  which is apparently the number one issue for Republicans across the country. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1160.1599999999999s)]
*  But I've not yet seen that anywhere. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1162.6s)]
*  And so but those are the people they choose to be their deities. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1163.9599999999998s)]
*  And, you know, and everything follows that path until, you know, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1168.0s)]
*  until they burn out, flame out or, you know, get exposed for what they really are. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1171.12s)]
*  How can you run a presidential campaign when you're. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1174.76s)]
*  Fighting multiple legal battles, criminal. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1178.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, that that's by design, right? [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you look at all of these things, they they understand. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1184.08s)]
*  Listen, Joe Biden in a basement is good for Joe Biden's campaign, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1187.24s)]
*  because if you put him on a stage, it's a negative, right? [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1190.72s)]
*  He's incapable of getting through a teleprompter. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1194.88s)]
*  He would get lost at this table. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1196.64s)]
*  Yes. And I, you know, I don't say that as glibly. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1198.2s)]
*  I just know it's just it's sad. I feel bad. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1201.88s)]

*  You know, Trump locked in a courtroom for five weeks while he should be campaigning. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1214.48s)]
*  That's that's really good for them because he can't he can bring that message to people. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1218.44s)]
*  People understand what he's saying. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1221.64s)]
*  It resonates with them. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1224.72s)]

*  Sort of expose the left for what it is, expose what we're talking about. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1233.72s)]
*  Breakthrough the noise put out there by the mainstream media, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1236.88s)]

*  You know, I mean, if I felt like if I was in charge of that, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1261.08s)]
*  if I was in charge of the Democrats, I would be winning elections 99.9 to point one. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1263.52s)]

*  Perhaps, honestly, the stuff that they've done to my father or family, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1274.16s)]
*  perhaps it's the most important thing to happen to America in recent history [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1277.8400000000001s)]

*  you know, whatever it may be. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1307.8s)]

*  you know, the machine just isn't delivering anymore. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1312.32s)]
*  And it's so unreal. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1314.68s)]
*  But the machine knows that and the machine exists to perpetuate itself. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1315.68s)]
*  That's the only point is to maintain power. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1319.64s)]
*  These are incompetent people with no other prospects in life [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1323.44s)]
*  other than running the machine. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1325.8s)]

*  Yeah. When I see what tech is doing, though, you even see it now. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1331.56s)]
*  Because I see, you know, just the algorithm. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1334.08s)]
*  It's like it'll show me just enough of what I want to see, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1336.84s)]
*  but never promote anything else, you know, and my meta platforms. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1339.32s)]
*  I haven't grown in three years, and yet everyone that comes up to me, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1342.16s)]
*  hey, you got the greatest Instagram I've ever seen. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1344.48s)]
*  So so the people who are already following me will see my stuff. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1346.2s)]
*  So it appears it's almost like it's AI designed to to let you think [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1349.64s)]
*  you're not being censored or that you're able to do it. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1354.76s)]
*  You're able to see the stuff that you want. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1358.04s)]
*  Oh, I'm aware they're preventing that growth. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1359.72s)]
*  You're you're well aware of that. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1361.24s)]
*  So, yes, you know, the evolution of that is making it harder. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1362.72s)]
*  You know, in in 16, 17, 18, when I was starting to get censored, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1365.44s)]
*  but, you know, let's call it Twitter 1.0. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1369.0s)]
*  You know, they're like, well, how do you know you're being said? [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1371.12s)]
*  I was like, well, because yesterday I got seventy five hundred retweets on a post. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1372.6s)]
*  Today I got three. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1375.84s)]
*  And it's you know, I do my own social. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1376.84s)]
*  When I hit that button, I know what it's going to do. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1378.84s)]
*  I know when it's OK, that's a decent post. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1381.48s)]
*  It's I know that's hot. That's going to go big. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1382.92s)]
*  And it's like when it goes big for about 30 seconds and then it's like [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1385.12s)]
*  just you see exactly what they're doing. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1388.32s)]
*  But they're they're coming up with better ways to make it appear [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1390.9599999999998s)]
*  as though they're not censoring while while still, you know, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1394.36s)]
*  continuing to perpetuate and push the ideals that they espouse and value. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1398.84s)]
*  No one interfered in the last election more than Mark Zuckerberg [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1403.08s)]
*  or Google and or Sergey Brin. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1407.4399999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1409.4399999999998s)]
*  So but let me ask you, the the convictions come down 34 [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1410.2399999999998s)]
*  yesterday and your father goes out there and just basically [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1414.52s)]
*  raises the middle finger and says we're going to win anyway. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1417.4s)]
*  And within hours, Benning Thompson of Mississippi, who's a monster, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1420.24s)]
*  Democratic congressman, says introduces legislation to pull a secret service. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1425.6399999999999s)]
*  So basically they're saying, OK, we'll kill you now. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1430.32s)]
*  Well, they did that a while ago. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1432.84s)]
*  Also, if he goes to prison, we want to pull his secret service. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1434.08s)]
*  So basically, if we put him in a cell, we're going to put him in a place [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1436.72s)]
*  where he could be murdered. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1439.44s)]
*  But that's a death threat. Of course it is. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1440.48s)]
*  But from a member of Congress. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1442.08s)]
*  Again, should it surprise us? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1444.68s)]
*  I mean, you look at half the congressmen, you know, get in their faces, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1445.76s)]
*  make them feel it. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1448.92s)]
*  I mean, they can say these things and they are lauded as heroes. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1450.0800000000002s)]
*  If we said something even remotely like that, you know, we're literally inciting [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1452.6000000000001s)]
*  violence. I mean, those words are violence. Tucker, we've we've seen this. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1456.1200000000001s)]
*  The double standard that's out there. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1459.04s)]
*  I mean, you know, but how hard is it for you to Congresswoman after congresswoman? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1461.88s)]
*  You have a Hamas caucus, you know, in Congress calling for, you know, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1465.04s)]
*  the death of people in the Middle East. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1468.88s)]
*  It's you know, well, that's OK. You can't do that. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1470.76s)]
*  If we did something similar, we'd be [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1472.48s)]
*  we'd be blocked, we'd be off of every platform, we'd be canceled. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1475.56s)]
*  And, you know, again, different games. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1479.08s)]
*  We're playing two very, very different games. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1482.88s)]
*  But that's so threatening. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1484.52s)]
*  We're going to mean Tony Fauci has seen he doesn't work for the government. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1486.68s)]
*  He's got Secret Service protection. He walks in the dog park. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1489.88s)]
*  Yeah. In Washington, D.C. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1492.32s)]
*  I happen to know for a fact, because it's my dog park, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1493.52s)]
*  former dog park, and he's got, you know, three guys following him. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1495.92s)]
*  But they want to pull it from your deck. Yeah. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1498.64s)]
*  Well, look at what they did with some of the justices, [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1500.48s)]
*  the Supreme Court justices, right? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1502.04s)]
*  I mean, you think that they'd be able to do what they've done to even [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1503.32s)]
*  I mean, Alito even this week, you know, we're going to make him [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1507.92s)]
*  recuse himself because his wife hung a flag upside down. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  It's like, well, you know, she can't express an opinion. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1511.92s)]
*  What they've tried to do to Clarence Thomas, what they did as it relates [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1514.68s)]
*  to Gorsuch and others, you know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1516.96s)]
*  it's insanity if they did that to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1520.2s)]
*  if they were picketing in front of their house like they did Amy Covey Barrett. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1522.6s)]
*  That would be a serious problem. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1526.04s)]
*  Those people would go to jail, of course. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1527.2s)]
*  But, you know, well, we'll let the you know, if that's the conservative justice, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1528.68s)]
*  let them suffer a little bit. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1531.64s)]
*  Well, we'll make sure it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1532.64s)]
*  But but it's effective because then you see some of them and they [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1533.52s)]
*  some of them are a little weaker than, you know, perhaps their principles. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1536.48s)]
*  And, you know, they're half man. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1539.3600000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit of maybe I got to go a little light on this one [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1540.88s)]
*  because it's not worth the headache. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1542.88s)]
*  I mean, when the Democratic Party's [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1544.24s)]
*  militia shows up outside your house, it's happened to me. Yeah. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1545.56s)]
*  You know, people are intimidated by that. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1548.64s)]
*  Of course. And we see it, you know, across the board. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1549.96s)]
*  It's designed, you know, the Hunter Biden laptop. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1553.08s)]
*  That's Russian disinformation. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1555.24s)]
*  Here's 52 intelligence officers signing off on it. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1556.28s)]
*  Oh, it must be four years later. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1558.24s)]
*  Oh, no, it's actually his laptop. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1559.72s)]
*  You know, there's no accountability for that either. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1560.92s)]
*  But you know, they're like, well, we're admitting it now. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1563.28s)]
*  It's like, no, but you got exactly what you wanted at the time. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1565.28s)]
*  We understand there's no accountability for it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1568.4s)]
*  You know, that's election interference as much as anything else. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1570.68s)]
*  Also, you know, there was the stat like I think was 17 percent of people said, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1573.0s)]
*  had they known about the Hunter Biden laptop, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1576.64s)]
*  it would have changed their vote in 2020. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1578.92s)]
*  I mean, 17 percent. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1581.3600000000001s)]
*  That's a lot. That's a lot of votes. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1583.64s)]
*  And yet, you know, that was the gospel. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1586.68s)]
*  And if you said anything about it, we've had the conversation about, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1588.28s)]
*  you know, Wuhan Lab Lake theory. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1590.68s)]
*  No, no, no. Of course, it didn't come from the lab that studies the virus. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1592.32s)]
*  In question, the one fund, I think it came from the wet market three feet outside [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1595.08s)]
*  of the lab. And if you believe otherwise, we're going to pull your funding. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1598.76s)]
*  If you're a doctor, you lose, you know, you lose tenure. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1601.6s)]
*  If you're at a university, you won't, you know, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1603.92s)]
*  Fauci is going to not sign off on your your your grants anymore. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1605.8799999999999s)]
*  And even if you were like, but you don't have to be a science. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1609.6399999999999s)]
*  You're like, how would you know you're not a virologist? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1612.56s)]
*  It's like you don't have to be a virologist to know that it happened there. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1614.6399999999999s)]
*  You just have to not be an imbecile. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1618.24s)]
*  Like, you know, you can have like mid, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1620.16s)]
*  you know, double digit IQ and be like, of course, it came from the place [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1623.0s)]
*  that studies the exact virus in question that was at ground zero of where it [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1626.8000000000002s)]
*  released and not from four feet outside of that. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1630.8000000000002s)]
*  Like you like it's insane. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1633.4s)]
*  And yet think of the truly intelligent people in positions of power and medicine [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1635.64s)]
*  and otherwise, who went along with this blindly because, you know, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1640.96s)]
*  it was easier to do and, you know, there was a lot of money and, you know, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1645.0s)]
*  when it's not going to hurt to do that now, though. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1647.76s)]
*  I mean, everything that's happened isn't all that long ago. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1649.96s)]
*  I mean, right. But at this I do think at this point, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
*  if you're still telling yourself those lies, you are lying to yourself. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1655.1200000000001s)]
*  You are a liar. It doesn't matter. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1658.28s)]
*  They corrected years later, but they got what they needed out of the ruse. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1659.28s)]
*  Right. Right. They got what they needed. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1663.92s)]
*  And again, because there's no accountability after the fact, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1665.48s)]
*  it doesn't matter. They'll do it again. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1668.1200000000001s)]
*  And they'll make it the gospel for six months or, you know, they always said, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1669.76s)]
*  you know, the difference between the truth and the conspiracy [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1672.3200000000002s)]
*  theory is six months. Yeah. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1673.92s)]
*  You know, now it's like six minutes, but they'll still get what they want out of [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1675.16s)]
*  that six minutes, use it to manipulate whatever they need to. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1677.64s)]
*  And, you know, I don't see that stopping. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1680.8400000000001s)]
*  I see more people being awake to it. Right. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1682.8400000000001s)]
*  That six months move to six minutes because people are not just blindly [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1685.48s)]
*  buying the BS anymore. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1689.44s)]
*  So how does it play out from here over the next five months? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1691.44s)]
*  I mean, they tried to put him in prison. They're still do you think he? [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1693.72s)]
*  We got to overwhelm the margin of fraud. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1696.6000000000001s)]
*  So it's just to ask, it's July 11th is sentencing. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1698.1200000000001s)]
*  July 11th. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1702.0s)]
*  Yeah, by the way, you think that's a coincidence? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  That's four days before the Republican National Convention. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1704.36s)]
*  You think that's a coincidental timing or do you think that's designed [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1707.7199999999998s)]
*  to throw a wrench into that? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1710.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know, yet another coincidence. Right. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1714.04s)]
*  What happens if they can they remand him and put him in jail then? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1716.6s)]
*  I imagine they will try. Right. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1720.28s)]
*  I mean, why wouldn't I? Yeah, of course. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1721.9599999999998s)]
*  Like, you know, does anyone think and again, I know that's too far. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1723.6s)]
*  That's too far. Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1726.84s)]
*  It's nothing's too far. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1728.6399999999999s)]
*  And again, until it happens, everyone, we have to stop giving them [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1730.4399999999998s)]
*  the benefit of the doubt, thinking they're going to act above board. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1733.48s)]
*  This is an arm's length transaction. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1737.08s)]
*  No, it's not. Like, what are you talking about? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1738.2s)]
*  There's not a single aspect of this case that should stand in any way. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1739.8s)]
*  But where do you appeal right now to the New York Appellate Division, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1743.72s)]
*  which is just as radical? [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1746.52s)]
*  You know, if and it's not just this case. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1747.92s)]
*  Look at all the shade, all the craziness around Fannie Willis. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1750.84s)]
*  Right. That case. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1754.56s)]
*  You look at Jack Smith and the FBI doctoring documents [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1755.88s)]
*  and setting up staging photos and then leaking it to the Washington Post. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1758.56s)]
*  Classified documents that end up on the front page of the Washington Post. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1761.4s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1763.8000000000002s)]
*  Each one of these things. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1765.3600000000001s)]
*  Wouldn't stand if we did this to meaning conservatives, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1768.0800000000002s)]
*  some sort of Republican did this to Obama. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1771.4s)]
*  It would it would never end. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1774.4s)]
*  It would be a perpetual story, and rightfully so. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1775.96s)]
*  And yet, like, hey, as long as it's against a conservative, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1779.0800000000002s)]
*  as long as it's against Trump, who's up against that machine, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1780.8400000000001s)]
*  we're going to allow these things to happen. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1784.0s)]
*  It's not like one of these things doesn't have any [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1785.3600000000001s)]
*  serious hair on it, right? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1788.92s)]
*  They're all shady as hell. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1790.12s)]
*  And yet it doesn't matter. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1791.6s)]
*  And our mainstream media almost refuses to cover it. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1792.76s)]
*  They won't talk about these things. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1796.08s)]
*  My father, in many cases, is gagged. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1798.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, think about that. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1800.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you know, First Amendment is kind of the First Amendment, right? [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1800.7199999999998s)]
*  It's a big one for us. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1804.1999999999998s)]
*  The president, former president of the United States is not allowed to talk [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1805.9599999999998s)]
*  about the facts of the case, because, you know, if people actually heard that [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1809.32s)]
*  from him, they'd realize just how much, you know, BS is in all of these things. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1812.56s)]
*  That's that should trouble a lot of people. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1817.28s)]
*  You think it stops with Trump? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1819.68s)]
*  Like, I mean, think about that. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1821.0s)]
*  I mean, if they can do it to arguably one of the most, you know, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1823.1200000000001s)]
*  out there, most powerful people in the world, [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1826.88s)]
*  a bank account to be able to fight a base to push it, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1831.2s)]
*  you know, venues to be a soapbox to speak from. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1834.0800000000002s)]
*  If they can do it to him, who can't they do it to? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1837.3600000000001s)]
*  But more importantly, if they will so flagrantly and so corruptly do it to him. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1840.8s)]
*  Who won't they do it to? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1846.3200000000002s)]
*  I mean, that's the question we have to be asking. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1847.64s)]
*  I mean, is anyone is anyone safe? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1849.12s)]
*  And it's you know, it's like people going blindly along. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1851.4399999999998s)]
*  Oh, it's going to be different this time. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1854.76s)]
*  I'm like, really? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1856.0s)]
*  Like that's what you've got out of this. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1856.9199999999998s)]
*  But if they put the Republican candidate who is leading in the polls, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1859.08s)]
*  all things equal, he becomes president again in November. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1862.1999999999998s)]
*  If they put him in jail right before the presidential, the Republican [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1865.4799999999998s)]
*  convention on fake charges stemming from a rigged trial, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1869.9199999999998s)]
*  they're kind of pushing violence, aren't they? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1875.8799999999999s)]
*  Listen, how do they expect you to respond? [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1879.1999999999998s)]
*  Nothing like that has ever happened in the reality. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1881.12s)]
*  You have to be careful even how you talk about that. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1882.7199999999998s)]
*  They are pushing. Well, they are. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1885.32s)]
*  They are clearly are. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1887.1599999999999s)]
*  But, you know, again, like nothing should surprise us. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1888.76s)]
*  The star witness of this case is someone who lied before every branch of Congress [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1891.76s)]
*  was disbarred, you know, lied to banks, lied to wives, lied to the press. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1894.9199999999998s)]
*  But we're expected to believe that he actually told the truth in this one instance. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1898.4799999999998s)]
*  Right. That's that's who they hang their hand on, because it doesn't matter [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1902.1999999999998s)]
*  when it's when it's rigged. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1905.32s)]
*  No, it is. It's me out. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1906.6s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1907.92s)]
*  And moving toward something ugly. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1908.5600000000002s)]
*  And I don't want that. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1910.3600000000001s)]
*  No, no one does. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1912.2s)]
*  But, you know, they're not going to let it play out. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1914.76s)]
*  I mean, do you think they'll ever take their foot off the gas? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1917.44s)]
*  No, it's not. They've gotten away with it for years. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1920.16s)]
*  How should people respond, do you think? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1924.28s)]
*  I think honestly, the reality is everyone has to get involved. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1926.4s)]
*  Yeah. And again, both sides. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1929.76s)]
*  I mean, you have to have, you know, people running for office. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1931.5600000000002s)]
*  And I'm not talking about president or Congress. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1935.3600000000001s)]
*  Like, you know, run for your school boards. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1936.88s)]
*  I mean, you know, that's perhaps the thing that's most important to me. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1938.4s)]
*  Like, frankly, there's a component of me that I don't want to win the presidency [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1940.64s)]
*  if we don't have Congress in the Senate, because I'll probably be up on charges again. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1944.64s)]
*  And we'll get to go through impeachment, you know, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1947.88s)]
*  and, you know, for the next four years. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1952.68s)]
*  And, you know, I don't think that's a great place to be. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1954.96s)]
*  But I think, you know, apathy has caused us a lot of problems, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1957.3200000000002s)]
*  especially on the conservative side. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1961.2800000000002s)]
*  Hey, we run businesses and we do these sorts of things. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1962.44s)]
*  And, you know, we want to spend time with our families. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1964.3600000000001s)]
*  All noble things are important, but we have to take the initiative to get involved [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1966.32s)]
*  at every level of these things, because the left has taken over every major institution [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1971.96s)]
*  in our country that controls what they've done in education, manipulating our children, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1976.32s)]
*  what they've done in entertainment, oftentimes the same thing. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1980.8s)]
*  It can't stand if we actually want to have have a future. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1985.68s)]
*  You know, our kids, they graduate high schools with the higher districts. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1990.04s)]
*  You know, no one can read or do math. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1992.92s)]
*  But, you know, they know the four thousand three hundred and seventy six genders. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1994.28s)]
*  And I imagine since this interview started, there's probably another 15 [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=1997.2s)]
*  that I haven't included that. So I don't want to be labeled as, you know, whatever. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2000.6399999999999s)]
*  And gender and gender bigot by by not including them. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2004.8799999999999s)]
*  But that's that's the last I've been able to keep track of. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2007.52s)]
*  We just live in in perilous times. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2011.76s)]
*  It does seem kind of heartening. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2014.56s)]
*  I think he raised more money in the hours after the verdict than anyone's ever raised. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2016.2s)]
*  How much you raise over, I think, thirty eight million dollars [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2020.24s)]
*  in the first couple of hours, small dollar donors. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2023.32s)]
*  And then there was a bunch of big dollar donor stuff. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2026.32s)]
*  That's what's interesting. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2027.96s)]
*  I mean, there's there are tech VC guys, respected guys [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2028.72s)]
*  that, you know, Hillary donors and even probably Biden donors. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2033.6s)]
*  They're like, OK, I've seen enough, you know, stroking, you know, six [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2036.6799999999998s)]
*  and seven figure checks now, because, you know, I think people who are watching [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2040.4399999999998s)]
*  closely enough truly understand [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2043.84s)]
*  just how far we have fallen, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2047.6s)]
*  just how close we are perhaps to that, you know, fulcrum point [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2051.52s)]
*  where there's a there's a point of no return. Right. Yes. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2054.08s)]
*  And I think if we ever let it get there, you know, there's no question in my mind [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2057.36s)]
*  that the Democrat elite, they'd maintain and seize that power. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2061.08s)]
*  And, you know, it'll happen like all sort of, you know, communist nations. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2063.6s)]
*  And that's where we're at. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2067.84s)]
*  And I think people see that in people who may not even agree with Trump on everything. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2070.0s)]
*  And you don't have to agree with Trump on anything like that. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2073.12s)]
*  You know, I obviously agree with him on everything, Tucker. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2074.96s)]
*  As the dutiful. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2078.92s)]
*  But, you know, it's reached a level of principle. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2080.92s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like, again, you know, name, name a metric where we're better off [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2083.1600000000003s)]
*  under Joe Biden, you know, we're on the brink of, you know, World War [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2088.44s)]
*  Three with the world's largest nuclear superpower by volume of nuclear capable, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2091.48s)]
*  you know, ballistic missiles. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2095.32s)]
*  I don't know. We're going to keep funding that. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2096.88s)]
*  We're OKing, you know, a guy that was a former like weirdo actor [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2098.84s)]
*  to send the US made missiles into Russia, provoking that, I guess. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2104.2000000000003s)]
*  And maybe that's what it is. Maybe that's the next distraction. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2107.96s)]
*  Right. You know, COVID was the distraction for 2020 to allow them to manipulate things. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2109.96s)]
*  Maybe World War Three is the distraction, you know, for this election. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2113.7200000000003s)]
*  Some of us called this a year ago. Yeah. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2117.88s)]
*  The senile man can't win. They're going to bring us to war. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2119.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, honestly, like, I don't say that lightly, but I also don't say it like, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2122.36s)]
*  I don't know. Would I be at all surprised? [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2128.1200000000003s)]
*  Not even though I think it's lunacy. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2130.84s)]
*  I think it's crazy. But do I think they would do it? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2132.76s)]
*  100 percent. 100 percent. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2134.92s)]
*  Do you think since you last question was just and I mean, I'd be skipping ahead, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2137.7200000000003s)]
*  but I don't think we're far from where we're at war with Russia. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2141.56s)]
*  Of course. If we're targeting a whistleblower talking about the boots on the ground. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2144.84s)]
*  I mean, like I've never seen a whistleblower disappear that fast in my life. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2148.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. You wonder why. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2151.1600000000003s)]
*  I wonder why. Huh. It's almost like it's happening. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2152.1200000000003s)]
*  But they would need, you know, the military is in very tough shape [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2154.52s)]
*  and recruitment is way down. No one wants to join the training military, understandably. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2157.88s)]
*  Now they're talking about, well, who would? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2162.28s)]
*  Well, why would you? Who's going to the guys you'd want fighting a war for you? [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2164.68s)]
*  You know, good, patriotic, red blooded Americans. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2168.04s)]
*  They don't want to go report to your trans admiral, not because if the trans admiral was [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2171.64s)]
*  patent, maybe they'd do it. Yeah. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2175.56s)]
*  The trans admiral ain't patent. No. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2177.08s)]
*  OK, the trans admiral is only an admiral because they're trans, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2178.68s)]
*  not because they're competent or capable. And it doesn't matter. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2181.16s)]
*  It's grotesque. A big part of signing up for that [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2183.8s)]
*  and possibly dying for your country is actually believing in the things that you're fighting for. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2186.36s)]
*  That's the basics of patriotism. That's exactly. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2189.88s)]
*  And if you don't believe in those things and you understand that you're going to be [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2191.64s)]
*  vilified, you know, you're going to be forced to not learn how to shoot, but do diversity training. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2194.28s)]
*  Why on earth would you do that? I wouldn't. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2199.4s)]
*  And that's the problem they're facing. And so, you know, the one solution was to take [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2201.1600000000003s)]
*  illegal aliens and put them in the military so we could have a. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2204.92s)]
*  Or flood our borders and, you know, put them in the voting roster. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2208.76s)]
*  And that's another way to make a pirate because you've lost other demographics [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2212.1200000000003s)]
*  that were reliable voters. But they're also talking about the draft. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2214.92s)]
*  You're hearing that all of a sudden. Maybe we need a draft. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2217.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. So we can be a never ending wars. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2220.28s)]
*  Again. No one's articulated to me. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2222.68s)]
*  And I kind of do this now, feels like for a living, like no one's articulated. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2227.3199999999997s)]
*  What is victory in Ukraine look like? I don't know what it means. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2231.24s)]
*  Like, I don't know. Is it just like perpetual death of [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2234.68s)]
*  Ukrainians and Russians until they're all wiped out and, you know, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2237.64s)]
*  Black Rock comes in there and takes over all the farmland? I mean, is that what it is? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2240.7599999999998s)]
*  Because it feels like that's what it is to me. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2244.04s)]
*  They're going to they're already selling off. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2247.4s)]
*  Land in Ukraine to foreign investors and they will flood Ukraine with third [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2250.2799999999997s)]
*  ruled immigrants and Ukraine will not exist in 50 years. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2254.04s)]
*  There'll be no Ukrainian nation and we betrayed them like no other country ever. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2257.24s)]
*  But I just ask, would people actually serve in a draft? [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2261.4s)]
*  I'd have a hard time. I mean, honestly, what is the metric I use for this is not just the [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2265.7999999999997s)]
*  recruitment numbers, but the amount of guys that I know, you know, you know, I shoot a lot [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2270.2s)]
*  and whatever the circles are tight, like that are like fourth generation army. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2273.88s)]
*  I just they're like, they're like, I would beat the crap out of my son if he decided to. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2277.88s)]
*  Like, these are guys that, you know, their entire ethos is around that military background. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2281.8s)]
*  They're great friends and they're like, I know they wouldn't even think about it. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2286.6s)]
*  They disown their children if they joined this military today. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2290.28s)]
*  And that's sad. It's the worst thing that's scary. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2293.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, Godspeed. Thank you for that. Thank you. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfIMO-glGFc&t=2298.04s)]
