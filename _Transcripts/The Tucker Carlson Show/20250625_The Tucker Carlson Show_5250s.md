# Everything You Need to Know About the Minnesota Assassinations and Tim Walz Destroying His State
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y)
*  Five years ago this summer, George Floyd, a convicted felon, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Odeed on fentanyl outside a convenience store in Minneapolis [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3.24s)]
*  and the country changed forever. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=7.12s)]
*  Five years later, Tim Walz is still the governor, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=10.44s)]
*  Keith Ellison is still the attorney general, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=12.72s)]
*  the cops who were falsely convicted of murdering George Floyd [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=14.76s)]
*  are mostly still in prison. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=18.64s)]
*  But what happened in Minneapolis itself? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=20.52s)]
*  Well, it's been wrecked. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=23.16s)]
*  And no one has said a word about it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=25.12s)]
*  Liz Collins is one of the only journalists remaining [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=27.8s)]
*  in the state of Minnesota. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=30.28s)]
*  And she gives us an update on the aftermath [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=32.64s)]
*  of the George Floyd revolution. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=34.52s)]
*  Liz, thank you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=36.52s)]
*  Media has died across the country. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=58.28s)]
*  Newspapers are going out of business. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  They're useless. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Local news basically gone. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=63.2s)]
*  And the hope was always that there would be [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=65.64s)]
*  responsible people who cared about facts, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=68.16s)]
*  reporting on what's happening at the state level and in cities. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  And in most places, that's not true, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=74.72s)]
*  but it is true in Minnesota, thanks to you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=75.83999999999999s)]
*  So I'm just grateful that you're filling that void [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=79.44s)]
*  because we need to know what's happening. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=82.16s)]
*  I want to start by, because I think you're an expert on it, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  what is the truth about the assassinations [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=88.39999999999999s)]
*  in your state of a couple of Democratic lawmakers? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  Who's the guy who, what is that? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=94.88s)]
*  There's lying around it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=97.44s)]
*  What's the truth? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=98.84s)]
*  Yeah, sadly, the chaos really continues in Minnesota. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=99.88s)]
*  Appreciate you having me on and thank you for your kind words [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=103.8s)]
*  about our reporting that we do over at Alpha News. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=108.56s)]
*  But this all starts on a Saturday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=112.64s)]
*  It's Saturday, June 14th, 2 in the morning. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=114.16s)]
*  And this shooting spree begins. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=117.52s)]
*  Vance Belter is the man who is charged now [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=120.08s)]
*  with the assassination of Melissa Hortman [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=123.28s)]
*  and her husband, Mark. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=125.6s)]
*  But what we know is that he first arrives [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  at Senator John Hoffman's home, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  the home he shares with his wife, Yvette. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  Their adult daughter happens to be in town during this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  And Belter is dressed as a police officer. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=138.6s)]
*  He's wearing also a latex mask. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=141.48s)]
*  He has a flashlight, arrives at their door saying, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=144.07999999999998s)]
*  police, open up. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=147.84s)]
*  He's shouting. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=149.0s)]
*  It's very chaotic. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  And basically this is- [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=151.24s)]
*  It's two in the morning? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=152.56s)]
*  Two in the morning. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=153.36s)]
*  They open their door to him and he starts shooting [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=154.36s)]
*  from what we understand. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=158.4s)]
*  Senator Hoffman is hit multiple times. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=159.88000000000002s)]
*  His wife hit multiple times. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  His daughter heroically calls 911, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  tells the police it's Senator Hoffman that's been shot. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  And this in a way, I think sends a message [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=172.12s)]
*  to the rest of the surrounding agencies [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=174.96s)]
*  that this could have something to do with legislators [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=177.52s)]
*  or perhaps people are being targeted [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=180.36s)]
*  to look for this person, obviously. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=182.2s)]
*  We know now that Belter stops at two more homes, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=185.24s)]
*  people who are not home, legislators that are not home. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=189.68s)]
*  At one point he encounters a police officer in New Hope. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=193.4s)]
*  That officer actually approaches his vehicle. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=198.2s)]
*  He is in a vehicle that looks like a squad car, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=201.08s)]
*  an SUV squad car, goes so far as to outfit it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=204.04s)]
*  with police lettering actually on the license plate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=206.76s)]
*  It says police on the license plate, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=212.32s)]
*  light bar, all the things you would look for in a squad. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=215.4s)]
*  This New Hope officer rolls up next to him. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=218.68s)]
*  He is looking straight ahead [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=222.12s)]
*  and does not acknowledge the officer at all. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=224.28s)]
*  She then rolls her window up and continues on [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=227.2s)]
*  to this lawmaker's home. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=230.4s)]
*  So there's some questions about, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=232.48s)]
*  how was he not apprehended in that moment? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=234.96s)]
*  This is when he then continues to the former House Speaker, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=237.84s)]
*  DFL House Speaker, Melissa Hortman's home. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=242.88s)]
*  And there at this point, the police catch up to him, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=245.28s)]
*  the Brooklyn Park Police Department, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=250.28s)]
*  they're doing a welfare check basically on the Hortman home [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=251.68s)]
*  saying, she doesn't live that far away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=254.88s)]
*  We should go to the Speaker Emerita, Melissa Hortman's home. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=256.48s)]
*  And they get there, shots ring out [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=261.28s)]
*  from what we understand between the police and Belter. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  Somehow Belter still gets inside the Hortman home, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=269.4s)]
*  Mark is killed, and then they find Melissa's body [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=272.88s)]
*  inside the home as well later on. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=276.03999999999996s)]
*  So the police are there for the shooting? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=279.52s)]
*  They are. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=281.47999999999996s)]
*  So how does he get away? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  Still a lot of questions about that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  What? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=287.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, I didn't know that, I didn't get that. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  He goes out a back door from what we understand, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=290.96s)]
*  he escapes on foot, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=294.0s)]
*  because he leaves his police cruiser there on scene. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  This is where they find out it's Vance Belter, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=298.0s)]
*  he has utility bills in this vehicle, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  things that I'll trace back to him. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=302.88s)]
*  And he gets back to an address that mysteriously [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=305.04s)]
*  he'd been renting for the last couple of years. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=308.36s)]
*  It's very strange. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=310.52000000000004s)]
*  He shared his home with his wife and five children [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=312.0s)]
*  in Greenisle, Minnesota, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  which is about an hour outside of Minneapolis, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=318.0s)]
*  but yet he was renting this room in Minneapolis [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=320.24s)]
*  where he would stay two or three nights a week [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  from what we understand from the neighbors. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=326.16s)]
*  And he'd show up at sometimes midnight, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=328.52s)]
*  leave at four or five in the morning. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=330.6s)]
*  We've been able to look a lot at his social media [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=333.48s)]
*  and what he's put out there. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=336.16s)]
*  He was working at some funeral homes, we understand, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=337.12s)]
*  and would keep these strange hours. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=341.12s)]
*  But neighbors actually thought he was a detective, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=343.72s)]
*  that's what they thought of him. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=345.76s)]
*  They thought it was strange that this guy [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=346.8s)]
*  would just show up a couple of times a week. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  He was working at funeral homes? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=349.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=351.28000000000003s)]
*  Doing what? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=352.12s)]
*  He said that he was doing kind of some, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=352.96000000000004s)]
*  just a disposal of bodies he would talk about openly [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=356.48s)]
*  in a little college course that we found a clip of. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=361.04s)]
*  But what's interesting is he ended his employment [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=364.64s)]
*  from what we understand from these funeral homes himself, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=366.72s)]
*  just more recently. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  It seems that there's perhaps some financial trouble [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=371.92s)]
*  with all of this. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=374.88s)]
*  Before we get into him, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=375.72s)]
*  can you just play out the rest of the timeline? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=376.92s)]
*  So he escapes through the back door somehow. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=379.2s)]
*  The police are there when he shoots these two people to death, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=382.04s)]
*  but they don't get him. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=385.71999999999997s)]
*  He winds up where and how long does it take [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  for them to find him? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=390.44s)]
*  So he goes back to this Minneapolis address. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=392.08s)]
*  How far is that from the scene? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=394.44s)]
*  It's a walk. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=395.96s)]
*  I mean, it's gonna take a little while to get there, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=397.64s)]
*  definitely five, 10 miles or so to that address. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=401.2s)]
*  And we have this all on surveillance camera. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=406.44s)]
*  We've been able to get some surveillance video [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=408.24s)]
*  from the neighbors who could see his last movements. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=410.68s)]
*  He's moving around some of his police cars. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=414.16s)]
*  At one point, a bike appears out of the shed. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=415.92s)]
*  It's all very strange. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=417.92s)]
*  But then he walks to a nearby bus stop. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=418.92s)]
*  And again, according to the charging document, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=421.40000000000003s)]
*  this is where he meets a stranger. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=423.48s)]
*  He wants to buy an e-bike off of this guy [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  who then offers and says, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  I actually have a car for sale too. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=429.32s)]
*  It breaks down a bit, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=431.08000000000004s)]
*  but he buys the e-bike and this black Buick [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=432.92s)]
*  from this stranger at the bus stop for $900. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=437.04s)]
*  This man actually drives him to the bank [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=440.48s)]
*  where he empties his $2,200 he has in his bank account. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=442.36s)]
*  This is when the FBI released a surveillance video [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  of him wearing a cowboy hat. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=448.92s)]
*  This is the last picture, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=450.96000000000004s)]
*  basically the picture they're releasing to the public [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=453.08000000000004s)]
*  to find this guy that morning. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=454.84000000000003s)]
*  But this then leads to the largest manhunt [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=456.64s)]
*  in Minnesota history to find him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=459.0s)]
*  He ends up, we know now, he'd been texting his wife. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=461.96000000000004s)]
*  He said something along the lines of, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=465.56s)]
*  dad went to war last night. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=468.04s)]
*  And also something about not wanting the kids [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=470.2s)]
*  to be on the property because there's gonna be some people [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=473.0s)]
*  that are trigger happy that could be there soon. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=475.56s)]
*  So that seemed to be an indication [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  he was going back to their home. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=479.88s)]
*  He calls himself dad in his text with his wife. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=480.72s)]
*  Right. Yeah, that's freaky. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=483.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  And then it sounds like he went back to that address [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=486.24s)]
*  to get money. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=490.64s)]
*  There was a large amount of money [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=492.56s)]
*  that was left at the home. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=493.40000000000003s)]
*  Ultimately though the- [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=494.84000000000003s)]
*  The one that he was renting. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=495.68s)]
*  The actual home that he shared with his wife [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  and children in Greenisle. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=499.92s)]
*  So he drives back there. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=501.12s)]
*  And then where does he go? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  He's actually found in a field [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=504.8s)]
*  not far from that home at all. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=506.44000000000005s)]
*  At this point, police had set up around his home. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=509.12s)]
*  It was pretty obvious he wasn't going to be getting [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=511.84000000000003s)]
*  into his house to get this cash. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=513.76s)]
*  His wife at one point is pulled over shortly after. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=516.4s)]
*  She leaves the property [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=520.6s)]
*  and she's found a couple hours from their home [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=524.72s)]
*  with guns, their passports and about $10,000 in cash. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=528.2s)]
*  Where are the kids? In their vehicle. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=533.5600000000001s)]
*  Three children are with her. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  Some of them are, a couple of them are older kids. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=537.32s)]
*  And it turns out from some of the reporting [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=540.8000000000001s)]
*  that's been done now, they called themselves preppers. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=543.88s)]
*  They had kind of a plan. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=547.48s)]
*  It's unclear if the wife was new of what he did. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=549.72s)]
*  Has she been charged? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=554.9200000000001s)]
*  She has not been charged, correct. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=555.88s)]
*  Wow, this is a weirder story than I realized. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=558.88s)]
*  Okay, so who is he? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=562.32s)]
*  What do we know about the man [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=564.0s)]
*  who has been charged with these murders? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=565.76s)]
*  Yeah, this is what's interesting. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=568.0s)]
*  He grew up in a small town in Minnesota, in Sleepy Eye. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=569.76s)]
*  His dad was a standout baseball star, a long time baseball. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=574.64s)]
*  Sleepy Eye is the name of the town? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=577.44s)]
*  Yes. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=579.8s)]
*  So great, I love this country. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=580.64s)]
*  And a lot of people have described him [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=582.52s)]
*  to us as a devout Christian. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=587.6s)]
*  I don't think you're a Christian [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=590.8s)]
*  if you're capable of this clearly. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=591.8s)]
*  It's interesting how the media, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  you see this happening with this story, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=596.8s)]
*  automatically takes their corners. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=598.48s)]
*  You have some friend of his that says he's a Trump supporter. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=601.24s)]
*  So this is how the story is painted, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=604.36s)]
*  that this lunatic Trump supporter [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=606.04s)]
*  goes on this rampage. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  But there's clearly so much more to this. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=611.12s)]
*  And that's what bothers me with the media. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=615.16s)]
*  Nobody's willing to really ask these questions. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=617.0s)]
*  So the Fourth of July is almost here. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=619.92s)]
*  In honor of that great holiday, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=621.12s)]
*  our friends at Pure Talk are on a mission [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=622.72s)]

*  that every person who serves this country [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=634.12s)]
*  deserves to fly a flag that comes from this country. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, an American flag made in China or Cambodia, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=640.36s)]
*  there's something off about that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=643.9599999999999s)]
*  No thanks. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=645.4399999999999s)]
*  So to help reach their goal, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=646.52s)]
*  Pure Talk is donating a portion of each June sale [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=647.56s)]

*  Pure Talk, it's America's wireless company. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=679.56s)]
*  What is that? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=681.88s)]
*  What are we looking at here? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=682.7199999999999s)]
*  This is bizarre. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=683.8399999999999s)]
*  Father of five, prepper from Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=685.3199999999999s)]
*  all of a sudden winds up wearing a latex mask [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=690.52s)]
*  in like a fake police car and murdering people. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=693.32s)]
*  And then the police don't arrest him somehow [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=696.44s)]
*  at the shooting. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=699.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=699.88s)]
*  So, but what do we know about him? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=700.7s)]
*  So. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=701.5400000000001s)]
*  So he has also a hit list in his vehicle, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=702.38s)]
*  literally called a hit list, a handwritten hit list. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=705.6s)]
*  It says hit list on it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=709.32s)]

*  Is he worried that he might forget what the list is? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=716.0s)]
*  There's all kinds of notebooks [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=717.72s)]
*  with all kinds of things in them from what we understand. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=719.2s)]
*  We did obtain this hit list that went out [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=721.44s)]
*  to law enforcement because obviously they were protecting [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=723.36s)]
*  all of these legislators trying to figure out [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=725.6400000000001s)]
*  where this guy was because this man hunt goes on [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=729.08s)]
*  for 43 hours before he just surrenders in a field, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=731.2800000000001s)]
*  puts his hands up in the air [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=734.36s)]
*  and basically walks toward law enforcement [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=735.48s)]
*  and says, I'm Vance Belter. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=737.4000000000001s)]
*  But this hit list, these are all Democrats on the list. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=741.8000000000001s)]
*  There's a couple abortion clinics, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=745.24s)]
*  Planned Parenthoods that are on there. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=746.96s)]
*  So people have said, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=748.86s)]
*  knows this is some sort of pro-life thing. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=750.1800000000001s)]
*  But also interestingly enough, he has a confession letter. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=753.26s)]
*  This is what I would call it. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=757.22s)]
*  It's a letter made out to the FBI to Cash Patel [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=759.3000000000001s)]
*  that says that governor Tim Walz made him do this. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=763.46s)]
*  He says that he made him do it [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=767.86s)]
*  because he wanted Senator Amy Klobuchar to be killed [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=769.54s)]
*  and Walz then to take that Senate seat. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=775.1s)]
*  Which again, makes no sense to any sane person, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=779.82s)]
*  but these are all part of the pieces [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=782.4200000000001s)]
*  that they already seem to be putting together. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=784.98s)]
*  Was Amy Klobuchar on the list? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=785.82s)]
*  What's interesting is Walz is not on the list. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=787.3000000000001s)]
*  Klobuchar is on the list. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=791.58s)]
*  There's somebody who has passed away that's on the list. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=795.22s)]
*  Some people who are not holding office anymore [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=799.3000000000001s)]
*  that are on the list. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=802.34s)]
*  So the list is a little strange in and of itself. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=803.86s)]
*  What did he spend his life doing? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=808.06s)]
*  What's his history? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=810.06s)]
*  This guy's in his 50s? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=811.46s)]
*  57. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=813.02s)]
*  Not a typical profile. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=814.66s)]
*  No, it's- [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=816.5s)]
*  Of a serial killer. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=817.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=818.62s)]
*  That's where it seems that there seems [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=820.3s)]
*  to be some financial issues. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=821.62s)]
*  We know that he spent some time in the Congo. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=824.5s)]
*  He talks about that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=827.8199999999999s)]
*  In Congo? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=829.9399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=830.86s)]
*  A lot of people from Sleepy Eye, Minnesota [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=832.06s)]
*  are just kind of hanging in the Congo. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=833.54s)]
*  Right, he was doing some mission trips. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=834.74s)]
*  Mission trips there. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=837.3s)]
*  But there are also some nonprofits that he would start, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=839.02s)]
*  but they had no customer base. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=842.34s)]
*  There was a couple of security businesses [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=844.7s)]
*  that didn't have actual customers. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=846.98s)]
*  His wife was listed on a website [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=849.26s)]
*  linked to a security business. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=852.34s)]
*  We know of this funeral homework that was going on. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=853.62s)]
*  Did he have a career? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=856.66s)]
*  I mean, did he spend- [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=857.54s)]
*  He was in the, again, according to his LinkedIn profile [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=858.8199999999999s)]
*  that is now down, but did decades [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=861.86s)]
*  in the food service industry. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=864.22s)]
*  He was a general manager at a 7-Eleven [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=867.06s)]
*  that was listed as well. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=869.06s)]
*  But from my law enforcement sources, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=871.62s)]
*  it sounds like just a lot of this was just made up. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=873.9s)]
*  Almost like there was this double life [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=877.26s)]
*  that was being lived. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=878.98s)]
*  At some point, he moves out part-time [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=881.42s)]
*  from his wife and five children [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=883.8199999999999s)]
*  to live in an apartment with a roommate. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=885.38s)]
*  I mean, what is that? [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=889.62s)]
*  The way his roommate described it, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=892.22s)]
*  he was working at these funeral homes [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=893.74s)]
*  and would keep odd hours. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=897.58s)]
*  And so Minneapolis would be closer [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=899.3000000000001s)]
*  to where these would be located. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=900.98s)]
*  But what's interesting is even in his last movements [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=904.38s)]
*  that have been tracked by the neighbors, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=907.4200000000001s)]
*  everybody has these great security cameras nowadays, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=909.58s)]
*  and they're doing the detective work themselves [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=913.62s)]
*  over in that neighborhood as well. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=916.58s)]
*  But you can see him coming in with some plastic bags. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=917.86s)]
*  We know now he'd bought some supplies at Fleet Farm [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=922.74s)]
*  just leading up to these attacks. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=925.4200000000001s)]
*  He's walking out with his notepads. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=927.38s)]
*  From what law enforcement has said, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=929.74s)]
*  he was doing a lot of writing, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=931.6600000000001s)]
*  a lot of ramblings as they've just described them. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=933.7800000000001s)]
*  At first, they said there was this manifesto. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=937.0600000000001s)]
*  They've kind of backed off on that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=939.5s)]
*  and said it's more of this hit list, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  nothing that seems to really make much sense [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=942.34s)]
*  as far as a motive is concerned at this point. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=944.6600000000001s)]
*  But for some reason, he did surrender to law enforcement [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=947.74s)]
*  and it seems in a way he wants to tell his story. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=952.06s)]
*  Wow. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=958.86s)]
*  Is there any evidence that he had contact [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=959.6999999999999s)]
*  with law enforcement before this at any level? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=961.8199999999999s)]
*  Actually, no, no criminal record, nothing. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=964.4599999999999s)]
*  Did he have any connection to the government at all [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=966.86s)]
*  that we know of? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=969.02s)]
*  Well, this is what's interesting. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=970.02s)]
*  Also in that confession letter, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=970.9399999999999s)]
*  he talks about he is trained by the military. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=972.3s)]
*  He says that he's, and this is what was on the website [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=975.66s)]
*  as well, that he did security in Eastern Europe, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=978.38s)]
*  Africa and the Middle East, it says on his website. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=983.7s)]
*  But at this point, just still so many questions [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=988.46s)]
*  about what is actually even true. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=990.7s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=994.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, it's been difficult because in Minnesota, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=996.58s)]
*  you just keep saying that these kinds of things [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1002.58s)]
*  don't happen and then they do. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1004.3000000000001s)]
*  And so much of this has happened. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1006.74s)]
*  We've kind of been dubbed this capital of chaos [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1009.82s)]
*  these last five or six years and it's pretty disheartening. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1013.38s)]
*  You try to approach everything as a reporter [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1018.3s)]
*  and gather as many facts, but you're like, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1019.98s)]
*  how have we now come to report on political assassinations [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1022.1s)]
*  in Minnesota? [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1026.18s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not surprised given what's happened [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1027.18s)]
*  in the last five years. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1029.82s)]
*  But I just wonder about this story in particular, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1031.94s)]
*  did he have contact with Walls? [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1035.58s)]
*  Do we know that Walls ever, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1037.18s)]
*  as Walls said, I met this guy ever? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1039.02s)]
*  Well, this is what's interesting. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1041.7s)]
*  We know that he served on a board appointed by Walls. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1043.46s)]
*  However, I'll say that- [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1049.1399999999999s)]
*  What kind of board was that? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1051.34s)]
*  It was a workforce development board. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1052.18s)]
*  They have, I think more than a hundred of these boards [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1055.18s)]
*  in Minnesota, most of them are voluntary boards. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1057.62s)]
*  So he was appointed to that board by Governor Mark Dayton, [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1060.66s)]
*  a Democrat, and reappointed by Walls. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1064.58s)]
*  That expired in 2023. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1068.4199999999998s)]
*  So it is unclear if they ever knew each other. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1071.06s)]
*  They were on the, interesting Senator Hoffman [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1073.26s)]
*  and Vance Belter were on the same board together. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1076.7s)]
*  So you would think that they somehow knew each other. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1079.78s)]
*  How did a 7-11 manager slash mortuary remains disposal guy [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1085.98s)]
*  wind up on a governor appointed board in the state? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1090.86s)]
*  Also a good question. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1095.3s)]
*  It's a little weird, right? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1096.3799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1098.7s)]
*  Yeah, there's just so many things in his background [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1099.78s)]
*  that don't seem to make much sense. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1101.82s)]
*  And also just, he had several properties in his name, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1103.78s)]
*  seven cars, he's asking for a public defender [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1108.3s)]
*  because he has no money. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1110.6599999999999s)]
*  He just paid more than $500,000 for his home [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1111.58s)]
*  in Greenisle a couple of years ago. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1116.02s)]
*  What? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1118.46s)]
*  So where's the money coming from? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1119.3s)]
*  I think there were questions about that as well. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1120.3799999999999s)]
*  From the body disposal business. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1123.46s)]
*  Like how much does, and this guy is renting an apartment [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1125.3799999999999s)]
*  to take a job hours from his $500,000 home [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1129.62s)]
*  that cannot be a high paying job. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1134.3s)]
*  I don't know what mortuaries pay to dispose of bodies, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1135.86s)]
*  but it can't be a lot. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1138.82s)]
*  Yeah, law enforcement seems to think that he'd been plotting [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1140.82s)]
*  something for a long time. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1143.58s)]
*  What was the final, I don't know. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1145.6599999999999s)]
*  Okay, so nothing about this makes sense at all. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1150.1s)]
*  Correct. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1152.58s)]
*  So there's been a ton of speculation that he, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1153.42s)]
*  like a number of other people, high profile murderers [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1157.6599999999999s)]
*  in the last 50 years may have been, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1163.46s)]
*  like not at all what he seemed to be. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1167.1399999999999s)]
*  This is like some sort of operation designed to discredit [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1168.78s)]
*  the enemies of the people who designed it. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1174.26s)]
*  Do you think there's any, I mean, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1175.74s)]
*  is it worth pulling on those threads? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1177.18s)]
*  Oh, I think it's worth it. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1180.62s)]
*  And that's what we've been doing. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1181.5s)]
*  It just seems that even talking to profilers through this, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1185.7399999999998s)]
*  they really, maybe there is something more [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1189.5s)]
*  because none of this actually makes sense or adds up [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1192.5s)]
*  to become that radicalized, what actually happened. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1197.4599999999998s)]
*  But it's a story we're obviously staying on. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1204.5s)]
*  Yeah, maybe we'll wind up like the Vegas shooting [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1207.6599999999999s)]
*  where it doesn't make sense at all [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1209.26s)]
*  and no one wants to talk about it [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1211.9s)]
*  and we just kind of forget about it. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1213.18s)]
*  Biggest mass shooting in American history [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1215.5s)]
*  that like no one mentions ever, but clearly it's not. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1216.86s)]
*  And you've already seen that with the media in Minnesota. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1220.42s)]
*  It's okay, he's a Trump supporter. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1222.54s)]
*  We, this is why he did it and that's it. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1224.78s)]
*  I mean, it's just absolutely insane [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1227.98s)]
*  what has happened to the media. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1229.46s)]
*  No curiosity, no common sense. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1231.3799999999999s)]
*  It's really disgusting and no wonder the public [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1233.9s)]
*  is not informed, especially in Minnesota. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1236.5s)]
*  Yeah, and this story is just inherently bizarre. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1239.9399999999998s)]
*  So you've, you're from the state, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1241.78s)]
*  you've worked in media there, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1243.78s)]
*  you were one of the highest rated anchors in the state. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1245.1s)]
*  You've made a couple references to the media. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1248.82s)]
*  It might be worth reminding people what happened. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1250.3799999999999s)]
*  If you could just give us a short tour of your work history. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1252.1399999999999s)]
*  How did you lose your job in television in Minnesota? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1256.82s)]
*  Yeah, so I worked at WCCO, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1260.6999999999998s)]
*  a long time anchor and investigative reporter there. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1263.1799999999998s)]
*  I was caught up in the George Floyd fallout. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1267.3799999999999s)]
*  My husband, a long time. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1270.58s)]
*  You murdered George Floyd? [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1272.3s)]
*  No, I did not. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1274.1s)]
*  Okay, good. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1274.9399999999998s)]
*  Despite what the media may tell you. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1275.78s)]
*  But they, yeah, so many people were canceled [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1279.1s)]
*  in the wake of all of that and I was one of them. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1283.02s)]
*  My husband, long time Minneapolis police officer, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1285.98s)]
*  he was serving as the union president at the time. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1288.4599999999998s)]
*  He came out with a few sentences that basically said, [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1292.62s)]
*  we'd like the body camera footage, we're awaiting that. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1296.18s)]
*  Let's not rush to judgment with all of this [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1299.98s)]
*  and we're backing these police officers until we, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1302.22s)]
*  he did what a union president, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1306.9s)]
*  I think probably is supposed to do. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1308.0200000000002s)]
*  I hope any American citizen would take that same position. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1310.14s)]
*  We're not gonna send people to prison [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1313.3400000000001s)]
*  unless we know they're guilty. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1314.66s)]
*  And then it was just like that. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1316.18s)]
*  You're probably pretty sick in Nike. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1318.26s)]
*  It's hard to blame you for feeling that way. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1319.7800000000002s)]
*  Any company that worships Colin Kaepernick, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1321.3000000000002s)]
*  any company that shills for the lunacy [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1324.38s)]
*  of the left social agenda is clearly not on your side. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1326.7800000000002s)]
*  In fact, they're your enemy. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1329.5400000000002s)]
*  You need an alternative. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1331.2600000000002s)]
*  XXXY Athletics is the far better choice. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1333.0600000000002s)]
*  It's the only athletic brand committed [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1337.18s)]
*  to fighting for free speech, women's sports, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1338.94s)]
*  and the truth, honesty, the truth. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1342.6200000000001s)]
*  They're not gonna lie to you. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1346.1000000000001s)]
*  For example, did you know that 80% of Americans [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1347.3600000000001s)]
*  oppose letting men play in women's sports? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1349.8600000000001s)]
*  That's not a radical view. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1352.98s)]
*  It's a moderate, sensible view rooted in biology. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1354.58s)]
*  But woke corporations like Nike make you feel [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1358.7s)]
*  like a lunatic for saying obvious things [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1360.6200000000001s)]
*  like men are men and women are women. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1363.24s)]
*  That is tyranny. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1365.06s)]
*  How can you fight back? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1367.06s)]
*  By abandoning the companies promoting it [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1368.18s)]
*  and by embracing companies like XXXY Athletics. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1370.78s)]
*  It's an American company. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1374.56s)]
*  It's not opposed to the United States [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1376.6200000000001s)]
*  or to telling the truth. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1379.34s)]

*  So your husband said, as the FOP president, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1388.02s)]
*  let's just find out exactly what happened [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1391.18s)]
*  before we decide, we know what happened. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1393.46s)]
*  And then what happened when he said that? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1396.3799999999999s)]
*  He had to lose his job. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1399.18s)]
*  I had to lose my job. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1400.74s)]
*  You lost his job for that? [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1401.94s)]
*  The mob came after us. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1402.78s)]
*  I mean, he had been planning at that point [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1404.3s)]
*  to retire around this time anyway. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1406.02s)]
*  But yeah, the mob came out in full attack. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1408.18s)]
*  I never anchored a newscast at WCCO ever again. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1411.9s)]
*  What? [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1415.46s)]
*  What did you have to do with it? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1417.02s)]
*  I'm still not exactly sure, but that's, [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1418.98s)]
*  fear is a powerful thing, I think, especially in Minnesota. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1423.26s)]
*  Well, let's unpack this. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1428.26s)]
*  Okay, so your husband had to leave [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1431.42s)]
*  after 32 years as a police officer [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1434.5800000000002s)]
*  because he said, let's wait for the evidence [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1436.58s)]
*  before deciding, okay. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1438.34s)]
*  I can see that happening in the hysteria [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1440.42s)]
*  and the race mobs that formed [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1443.06s)]
*  after George Floyd, Odita and Fendel. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1445.3799999999999s)]
*  But what do you, how are you, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1448.7s)]
*  why would you be punished for that? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1450.42s)]
*  Yeah, it was ridiculous. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1453.34s)]
*  I finished out my contract and then eventually left, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1455.74s)]
*  but I would go- [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1458.5s)]
*  But why were you not allowed to do newscasts after- [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1459.82s)]
*  First I understood that I obviously [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1462.86s)]
*  can't report on this story. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1464.06s)]
*  There's a conflict of interest and I never had, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1465.3s)]
*  I'd never reported on police union issues in Minneapolis. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1467.3s)]
*  I mean, we'd been married for a few years [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1470.7s)]
*  by the time this even happened, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1472.94s)]
*  but all of a sudden it became like [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1473.98s)]
*  we were in this hidden marriage. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1475.1s)]
*  As if I was supposed to start every newscast [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1476.06s)]
*  by talking about who my husband is. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1479.06s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine in this world [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1480.4199999999998s)]
*  why this even matters? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1482.86s)]
*  But then it appeared, my name started appearing, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1484.18s)]
*  every story that I did, no matter what, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1487.6599999999999s)]
*  it would be, and just a reminder, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1489.54s)]
*  Liz Collin is married to Bob Kroll. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1491.4199999999998s)]
*  I mean, literally this would be printed in stories [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1492.8999999999999s)]
*  on our website. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1496.02s)]
*  And I was like, this is just completely, absolutely insane. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1498.1399999999999s)]
*  Wait, your employer put that? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1501.94s)]
*  Yes, it was this disclaimer [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1503.1s)]
*  because they felt like they needed to, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1504.7s)]
*  the public needed to know this [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1507.02s)]
*  because of everything that had transpired. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1509.6599999999999s)]
*  So the station, without asking you, kept doing this. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1512.06s)]
*  Right, this is a CBS station. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1515.6599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I don't think, I think you can watch any CBS station [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1517.6599999999999s)]
*  and realize what is going on in those places. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1520.62s)]
*  CBS. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1524.8200000000002s)]
*  Oh, it's an operating. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1525.66s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1526.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1527.8200000000002s)]
*  So how did they tell you you're no longer allowed [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1528.66s)]
*  to do your job because of who your husband is? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1531.6200000000001s)]
*  Well, at first it just drags on for weeks, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1533.8200000000002s)]
*  weeks turn to months and... [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1536.5800000000002s)]
*  But they pulled you off the air. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1539.78s)]
*  Yes, I was still allowed to report on a few things, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1541.18s)]
*  but I was no longer allowed to report on state government, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1545.42s)]
*  city government, anything to do with policing. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1547.8200000000002s)]
*  I would have to get permission [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1551.18s)]
*  before I would even be able to call someone [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1553.42s)]
*  in law enforcement. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1555.22s)]
*  I mean, this has been my career. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1556.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, I have a lot of good sources [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1558.02s)]
*  and I've reported on a lot of these issues [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1559.8200000000002s)]
*  long before I was even married to Bob, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1562.98s)]
*  but all of a sudden everything became an issue. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1565.5800000000002s)]
*  And I will say that my husband appeared on stage [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1569.9s)]
*  with President Trump. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1573.02s)]
*  This was back in 2019 when he was running for reelection [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1575.22s)]
*  and that really became an issue with the station as well. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1578.7s)]
*  That your husband liked Trump. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1586.14s)]
*  Correct. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1587.38s)]
*  Yeah, you can't have an anchor whose husband likes Trump. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1588.5800000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1591.02s)]
*  Right, okay. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1591.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a really sick country, wow. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1593.7s)]
*  So then you said the mob came, what does that mean? [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1597.14s)]
*  It really just means the mob came. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1600.5s)]
*  They... [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1602.1000000000001s)]
*  You're very literal, okay. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1602.94s)]
*  They showed up to the station, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1604.5400000000002s)]
*  they held a protest demanding that I be fired. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1607.02s)]
*  For being married to a cop. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1610.94s)]
*  Right, yes. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1612.58s)]
*  And then they showed up at our home four different times. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1614.6599999999999s)]
*  We had protests that summer of 2020. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1617.78s)]
*  At your home? [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1619.58s)]
*  Yes, one sponsored by Black Lives Matter. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1620.78s)]
*  They showed up with a pinata effigies of myself [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1624.58s)]
*  and my husband and beat us in our driveway. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1627.6599999999999s)]
*  Welcome to South Africa, that's crazy. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1631.1799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1633.8999999999999s)]
*  You had a child at home? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1634.9s)]
*  We were not home that weekend, but yes, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1636.54s)]
*  actually my child discovered this on YouTube [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1639.5s)]
*  years after it happened. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1642.34s)]
*  I thought I would keep it from him, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1643.38s)]
*  but he can't do that I guess in this digital world we live in. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1645.02s)]
*  Would you attempt to shoot them? [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1650.02s)]
*  I think that's why I made sure my husband left town. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1651.34s)]
*  No, I mean, that's such a threatening act. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1653.7s)]
*  I'm against shooting people in general, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1659.1s)]
*  but I think I would shoot someone who did that [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1660.54s)]
*  just because I would feel so threatened. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1662.22s)]
*  I mean, your home? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1663.46s)]
*  Yeah, I've never felt so violated before. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1664.74s)]
*  I consider myself a pretty strong person, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1669.1000000000001s)]
*  but it took me even a long time [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1671.74s)]
*  to even walk in the front lawn again, just thinking. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1673.02s)]
*  They took a knee around our flag, our American flag. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1676.3000000000002s)]
*  If you were black, you were allowed to kneel [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1679.26s)]
*  in our front yard. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1680.66s)]
*  And if you're white, you had to look on. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1682.02s)]
*  As they were shouting, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1684.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, they literally brought a bullhorn. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1685.8600000000001s)]
*  They were shouting swear words at our neighborhood kids [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1687.7s)]
*  threatening to burn the city down where we lived. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1690.46s)]
*  And no one shot them. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1693.98s)]
*  It's so weird how passive people are. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1695.26s)]
*  Like you couldn't get away with that 50 years ago. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1697.02s)]
*  You couldn't do that. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1699.02s)]
*  Many cities have now passed ordinances in Minnesota saying, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1700.02s)]
*  if you don't pull a permit to protest, [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1704.26s)]
*  we're going to arrest all of you [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1706.46s)]
*  because nobody was arrested. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1707.46s)]
*  Nothing happened that day. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1708.46s)]
*  And your husband was a cop [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1711.46s)]
*  and his fellow cops didn't, nobody did anything. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1714.0600000000002s)]
*  Well, they wanted to show up also, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1716.94s)]
*  but you know, we also have to recognize with these groups, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1718.42s)]
*  this is what they want. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1723.7s)]
*  They want confrontation. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1725.2600000000002s)]
*  They want lawsuits. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1726.46s)]
*  This is what they want. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1727.46s)]
*  Maybe if someone smacked them in the face once in a while, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1729.3400000000001s)]
*  they'd be a little more respectful. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1731.22s)]
*  I mean, I just think if you allow that kind of behavior, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1733.0600000000002s)]
*  you're going to get more of it, right? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1735.14s)]
*  Well, and I actually think this is [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1736.2600000000002s)]
*  what has happened in Minnesota. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1737.8200000000002s)]
*  These political disagreements have turned [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1739.18s)]
*  into these political attacks [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1741.14s)]
*  and people have allowed this to happen. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1742.7s)]
*  Well, I completely agree. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1744.5400000000002s)]
*  It's passive Scandinavians. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1745.5800000000002s)]
*  I know them well. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1747.14s)]
*  I hate them. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1749.3s)]
*  Sorry, excuse me. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1750.1399999999999s)]
*  I'm one of them. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1750.98s)]
*  You are one of them. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1751.82s)]
*  No, I know, but that's why I can say that. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1752.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm allowed to say that. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1753.5s)]
*  But yeah, yeah, they're totally passive and self-hating [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1754.34s)]
*  and you know, rape my wife. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1756.34s)]
*  I mean, they're really, it's a sickness in their brains, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1758.5s)]
*  but that's just so sad. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1761.62s)]
*  And they came back more than once, this mom? [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1763.74s)]
*  Yeah, this was the largest. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1765.8999999999999s)]
*  I mean, it was more than a hundred people paid, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1767.4599999999998s)]
*  people paid to be there that day. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1769.74s)]
*  They had lunch provided. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1772.82s)]
*  I mean, this is just completely insane. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1773.86s)]
*  Who do you think paid more? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1775.54s)]
*  Well, Black Lives Matter was involved. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1776.8999999999999s)]
*  And this is what I thought was interesting as a reporter. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1779.1s)]
*  So keep in mind, I was still working at WCCO at the time, [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1780.9799999999998s)]
*  but I called my news director and I said, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1784.3799999999999s)]
*  the man leading this protest, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1787.1399999999999s)]
*  he's running to be a state rep [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1789.1799999999998s)]
*  and he's endorsed by Walls and the Democratic Party. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1791.62s)]
*  I think that we should probably cover this. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1795.1s)]
*  I did a story on this. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1796.6599999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1798.4199999999998s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1799.4599999999998s)]
*  I saw the protest on the news by you. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1800.6999999999998s)]
*  This is all coming back to me. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1801.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1803.78s)]
*  Was that guy elected state rep? [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1805.2199999999998s)]
*  He was elected. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1807.3799999999999s)]
*  And I called my news director and I said, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1808.2199999999998s)]
*  I think this is newsworthy. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1809.06s)]
*  You will not even believe what happened. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1809.8999999999999s)]
*  And I was told that- [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  He was a racist too, that guy. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1813.02s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1814.54s)]
*  But I was told that that phone call showed my bias. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1815.4599999999998s)]
*  How dare I think that that's a news story? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1819.3s)]
*  You're so bias. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1822.4199999999998s)]
*  They said that to you at the station? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1824.3799999999999s)]
*  And so it would be days before they actually even reported [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1826.6999999999998s)]
*  on the protest before they had no choice, but- [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1828.86s)]
*  At their own employee's house. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1831.34s)]
*  Correct. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1832.6999999999998s)]
*  A guy running for state house, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1833.54s)]
*  saying racist, anti-white things. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1835.3s)]
*  I remember this now. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1836.9s)]
*  Wow. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1837.74s)]
*  I totally forgot this. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1838.58s)]
*  That was you. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1839.82s)]
*  That was me. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1840.82s)]
*  I'm so sorry. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1841.94s)]
*  That's so hateful. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1844.5s)]
*  So how long were you at the station after that? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1845.86s)]
*  So I finished my contract a couple of years, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1848.3s)]
*  not even quite. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1852.66s)]
*  And then I had kind of as a therapy, [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1853.74s)]
*  worked on my book called, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1858.06s)]
*  They're Lying, The Media of the Left [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1860.5s)]
*  and the Death of George Floyd, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1861.98s)]
*  which is a bit about my personal story [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1863.18s)]
*  and so much of the truth that just never stood a chance [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1865.38s)]
*  with all of this. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1870.02s)]
*  And I left, I went into independent media. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1870.9s)]
*  I didn't want to lie anymore. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1872.6200000000001s)]
*  I was disgusted with what the media had turned into. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1874.94s)]
*  How long were you at the station? [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1878.22s)]
*  Nearly 14 years. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1880.5s)]
*  Wow. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1882.1000000000001s)]
*  So what about all the people, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1883.22s)]
*  when you work in a place, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1884.6200000000001s)]
*  you like, you know your supervisor, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1885.8600000000001s)]
*  you know all the vice presidents [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1888.42s)]
*  and the station manager, the HR people, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1890.42s)]
*  did anyone ever say, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1894.14s)]
*  gosh, we're really mistreating you, we're sorry. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1895.3000000000002s)]
*  Been here 14 years and were anyone, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1897.3000000000002s)]
*  was any human touch at all? [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1900.5800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I still have, you know, still have some friends, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1903.22s)]
*  but I think that's really in life where [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1905.98s)]
*  they knew the professional I was, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1910.94s)]
*  they knew the work that I had done and that hurt, [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1912.98s)]
*  you know, for the people that, you know, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1916.98s)]
*  I kind of needed to stick up for me in that moment [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1919.3s)]
*  and they didn't. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1921.86s)]
*  But it's also a bit of a relief knowing that, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1925.1s)]
*  that's why when I left, I was ready. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1929.02s)]
*  I was, you know, I knew that I could, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1931.54s)]
*  it was time to listen to that little voice inside of me [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1933.7s)]
*  and I'd been praying about it for a long time [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1935.82s)]
*  and just knew that there were things [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1939.14s)]
*  that I really had to do. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1941.66s)]
*  It was a matter of truth. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1943.66s)]
*  I hope the station goes bankrupt. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1944.5s)]
*  Is it still there? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1945.5s)]
*  I don't think they're doing so well, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1946.34s)]
*  but I think that's local media in general. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1948.58s)]
*  Since we launched Alp, we've had four flavors, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1951.3s)]
*  but we are proud to announce Alp has a brand new flavor, [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1954.3s)]
*  one of several will be rolling out over the next year or so [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1958.1s)]
*  and it is Sweet Nectar. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1962.02s)]
*  I have personally tested this product two at a time [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1964.3s)]
*  and it's excellent. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1971.58s)]
*  Sweet Nectar, the new flavor out from Alp, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1972.54s)]
*  really, really good. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1975.3s)]
*  You can order it in bulk by the pallet if you want. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1976.1399999999999s)]
*  I have strongly recommended Sweet Nectar. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1979.3400000000001s)]
*  Stay tuned for more information. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1981.7s)]
*  But to abandon your longtime employee [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1983.54s)]
*  because the mob demands it is like maybe the lowest thing [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1992.38s)]
*  I can think of. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1995.38s)]
*  You know, it was crazy because I grew up [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1997.06s)]
*  watching that station. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=1999.54s)]
*  I mean, literally it was the dream job [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2000.74s)]
*  when I finally landed it, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2002.54s)]
*  when I worked in all these crappy markets, you know, [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2003.74s)]
*  I lived in crappy places, but I loved the news [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2006.18s)]
*  because I always felt like I'm just gonna do [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2010.6200000000001s)]
*  whatever it takes to get back home, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2013.1000000000001s)]
*  to be able to broadcast my hometown and whatnot [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2015.26s)]
*  as goofy as that sounds. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2020.0200000000002s)]
*  It doesn't sound goofy, it sounds great actually. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2021.18s)]
*  And then it happened and just kind of, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2023.5400000000002s)]
*  but it's not even before George Floyd, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2027.8600000000001s)]
*  you could see what the media was turning into. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2030.7800000000002s)]
*  And that really bothered me on a moral and ethical level [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2034.22s)]
*  more than anything else. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2036.5800000000002s)]
*  Just not so much what we would tell the public anymore [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2038.42s)]
*  but what we would not, how we would craft a story. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2041.3400000000001s)]
*  I talk a lot about this in the book, [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2046.78s)]
*  but there were mandates after George Floyd [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2048.58s)]
*  that half of the people we interviewed [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2051.7000000000003s)]
*  had to be non-white or from a protected class [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2054.1s)]
*  in the wake of that. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2057.46s)]
*  Where did those mandates come from? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2058.3s)]
*  From what I understand, CBS News. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2060.1800000000003s)]
*  You could not use the term riots at all in your reporting. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2063.26s)]
*  Actually? [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2066.34s)]
*  Right, just the way we would control the language [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2067.1800000000003s)]
*  and shape stories. WCCO? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2069.5400000000004s)]
*  Correct. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2071.94s)]
*  Boy, I can't, when they do go bankrupt, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2073.1400000000003s)]
*  will you text me just so I can celebrate? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2075.1400000000003s)]
*  I really hope that they go under soon. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2076.9s)]
*  That's so dishonest. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2079.38s)]
*  Yeah, it hasn't, it's actually only gotten worse I think [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2081.5s)]
*  with a lot of things that have transpired. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2086.38s)]
*  But again, I feel blessed to be on the other side. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2089.58s)]
*  Perhaps you can relate. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2092.86s)]
*  You're a positive person. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2093.7s)]
*  It's just, I think it's important to know, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2096.62s)]
*  because the net effect was the death of a lot of people, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2099.22s)]
*  the total destruction of a great American city. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2102.22s)]
*  It was just pure evil in the end. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2106.5s)]
*  Black people didn't benefit, white people didn't, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2108.62s)]
*  I mean, no one benefited really. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2110.58s)]
*  And it just bothers me that it's been memory-holed [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2113.86s)]
*  and that no one responsible for the killing [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2116.58s)]
*  and the destruction has ever been held accountable. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2119.62s)]
*  Since you wrote a book on it, and it's been five years, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2122.42s)]
*  can we just assess what was the George Floyd thing, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2126.42s)]
*  do you think? [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2130.3399999999997s)]
*  Having looked into it more than maybe any other person, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2131.18s)]
*  like how did George Floyd die? [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2135.62s)]
*  What was that? [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2138.54s)]
*  How did, why did that instantly become a revolution [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2139.38s)]
*  that wrecked my country? [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2143.5s)]
*  And what was that? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2145.58s)]
*  You could definitely tell, I mean, Minnesota, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2147.7s)]
*  we really had the perfect players in place. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2149.4199999999996s)]
*  Again, we have Governor Tim Walz, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2152.5s)]
*  we have Attorney General Keith Ellison, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2154.3799999999997s)]
*  Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2156.62s)]
*  This was an election year that had so much to do with it. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2159.8999999999996s)]
*  And you could see these things were happening [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2163.66s)]
*  around the country, just looking to spark chaos. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2165.18s)]
*  And in Minneapolis, they had the recipe. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2171.02s)]
*  And I saw the manipulation day one. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2174.42s)]
*  They did not release the body camera videos. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2178.98s)]
*  Can I say it was one of the whitest cities in America, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2181.34s)]
*  along with Portland and Seattle? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2184.1400000000003s)]
*  That's true, yes, primarily, yes. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2186.58s)]
*  So that is another factor. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2188.5s)]
*  It's the, this didn't happen in Miami [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2190.1800000000003s)]
*  because the Hispanics don't hate themselves, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2192.38s)]
*  but the whites do. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2193.82s)]
*  This is just my editorializing. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2194.6600000000003s)]
*  It's just the demographics played a role in this. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2196.1s)]
*  It was the whitest cities that went the craziest. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2198.2200000000003s)]
*  But you have this, as they frame it, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2201.26s)]
*  this white police officer, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2203.42s)]
*  kneeling on the neck of a black man. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2205.86s)]
*  The optics were there. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2207.78s)]
*  However, the body camera video shows a much different story. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2210.82s)]
*  And if they would have released this, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2214.58s)]
*  I just don't even think we'd be here [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2216.5s)]
*  having this conversation. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2217.62s)]
*  But is there any evidence that George Floyd [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2218.46s)]
*  was suffocated by Derek Chauvin? [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2220.26s)]
*  No, there is much more evidence to support that [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2223.62s)]
*  that in fact had nothing to do with it. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2226.62s)]
*  You have George Floyd talking about how he can't breathe [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2227.98s)]
*  before Derek Chauvin arrives on scene. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2230.9s)]
*  You have a black police officer who arrested George Floyd [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2233.6200000000003s)]
*  in Alex King, who was on the job for three days [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2236.54s)]
*  off of his field training. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2239.1400000000003s)]
*  Nobody talks about Alex King. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2240.7000000000003s)]
*  Nobody knows him. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2242.02s)]
*  He just got out of prison. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2243.1400000000003s)]
*  He went to prison? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  He's one of the four police officers put in prison. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2245.6200000000003s)]
*  But nobody knows about, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2249.94s)]
*  they think this is just a white cop, black suspect. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2251.2200000000003s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2255.1s)]
*  And this is the story the media told, and it's disgusting. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2255.94s)]
*  The bottom line, is there actual evidence [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2259.62s)]
*  that Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2262.7s)]
*  I would say the answer is no. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2265.86s)]
*  There's no strangulation marks. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2268.22s)]
*  There's no bruising on his neck. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2269.7799999999997s)]
*  Why didn't they release the autopsy, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2272.38s)]
*  which was done within 12 hours of him dying [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2274.14s)]
*  to the public that showed all of this? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2278.2599999999998s)]
*  He had an enlarged heart. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2281.18s)]
*  He died of a heart attack. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2282.7s)]
*  The first words on his autopsy are just that, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2283.98s)]
*  cardiopulmonary arrest is his cause of death. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2287.86s)]
*  He did not die of suffocation? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2290.82s)]
*  No. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2292.6600000000003s)]
*  So why is Derek Chauvin still in jail? [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2295.06s)]
*  Why did Officer King go to jail? [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2297.38s)]
*  Is there anyone else in jail for this still? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2299.9s)]
*  Thomas Lane was released also, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2301.7000000000003s)]
*  and Tu Tao was still in prison. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2303.6600000000003s)]
*  Tu Tao was given an extra year on his sentence [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2305.5s)]
*  because the judge in this case, Judge Peter Cahill, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2308.6200000000003s)]
*  did not like how he was reciting Bible verses [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2311.38s)]
*  during his sentencing and gave him an extra year. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2313.7000000000003s)]
*  But the real threat is Iran. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2317.86s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2319.6600000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2322.6600000000003s)]
*  Wow, that's so offensive. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2323.5s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2324.7400000000002s)]
*  You still live there. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2325.58s)]
*  I do, yeah. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2327.34s)]
*  So how did, if there's no evidence [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2330.1800000000003s)]
*  that he murdered George Floyd, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2333.1s)]
*  why was I at Fox scolded for saying [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2335.7000000000003s)]
*  that he didn't murder George Floyd, which I was, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2338.02s)]
*  by the way, I said George Floyd seemed like he died [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2339.94s)]
*  of a drug OD, because that's what the police said. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2341.78s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2344.38s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2345.2200000000003s)]
*  Why was I at Fox scolded for saying that he died [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2346.06s)]
*  of a drug OD, because that's what the autopsy seemed to say. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2347.58s)]
*  Why is that not widely known? [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2350.7s)]
*  Why does nobody, even now, five years later, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2352.38s)]
*  people have to be like, oh, he was killed by a white, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2354.98s)]
*  and all these, try not to use the effort, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2356.58s)]
*  but all these Republican office holders are like, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2358.74s)]
*  no, he was murdered by a, you know what I mean? [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2360.94s)]
*  White cop. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2363.98s)]
*  Yeah, I hear it still. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2364.82s)]
*  But that's not true. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2365.66s)]
*  Yeah, it isn't. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2366.62s)]
*  And there's a reason race never even came up [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2367.9s)]
*  in Derek Chauvin's trial. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2370.58s)]
*  There's no evidence of race having anything [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2371.7s)]
*  to do with anything. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2373.98s)]
*  And that's why I put the book out, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2375.9s)]
*  and it was released in 2022, right before, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2377.62s)]
*  I wanted it out before the election for Walls and Ellison. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2381.78s)]
*  Sadly, it didn't work. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2385.62s)]
*  But then it led to the documentary called [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2386.46s)]
*  The Fall of Minneapolis. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2389.5s)]
*  And we tried to really bring out the truth [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2390.86s)]
*  that nobody heard in this case, in that documentary. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2394.1s)]
*  And more than 10 million people have seen it [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2397.1800000000003s)]
*  all around the world, which is amazing, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2399.06s)]
*  considering it was just kind of this little documentary. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2402.78s)]
*  But it also, I think, proves that the truth still matters. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2405.86s)]
*  I just wish somebody would do something about it. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2408.7000000000003s)]
*  So is this, is there anyone else in Minneapolis saying this? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2412.34s)]
*  No, it's actually interesting. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2418.42s)]
*  They then paint me, of course, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2419.5400000000004s)]
*  I'm a right-wing conspiracy theorist. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2422.1000000000004s)]
*  That's how I'm referred to. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2424.1000000000004s)]
*  I'm just a crazy person for bringing out these facts. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2424.98s)]
*  I mean, again, I think it's 237 citations I have in my book. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2427.78s)]
*  I'm a journalist. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2432.42s)]
*  This is what I've done for 20 years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2433.38s)]
*  But what's the counterargument? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2434.82s)]
*  Is, okay, so everyone stands up, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2436.06s)]
*  Nikki Haley and Jeb Bush and all these people, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2438.46s)]
*  probably the majority of the Republican senators [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2444.46s)]
*  who were serving five years ago said this, [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2448.38s)]
*  black man murdered by a white cop. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2451.14s)]
*  What evidence are they pointing to to prove that? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2454.1s)]
*  And how did he get convicted of it? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2458.02s)]
*  Well, the trial in and of itself [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2460.22s)]
*  is really quite something. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2461.94s)]
*  You have the police training, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2464.46s)]
*  the maximal restraint technique [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2466.14s)]
*  that the office was reusing that day. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2468.3799999999997s)]
*  That was not allowed in trial. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2469.98s)]
*  Judge Cahill did not allow that in Chauvin's trial. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2471.74s)]
*  Can you explain what that is? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2474.98s)]
*  So interestingly enough, [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2476.06s)]
*  these two pages of the manual go offline [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2478.94s)]
*  two days after the incident. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2483.02s)]
*  They disappear, the MRT. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2485.3399999999997s)]
*  And you can hear in the body camera footage, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2487.98s)]
*  which again, the public is not allowed to see [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2489.9s)]
*  until many months later. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2492.46s)]
*  And to this day, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2494.3s)]
*  most people have never taken the time [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2495.1400000000003s)]
*  to watch the video, of course. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2496.78s)]
*  And the officers are talking about the MRT. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2500.1400000000003s)]
*  Thomas Lane says, let's just MRE, he means MRT. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2503.2200000000003s)]
*  They all are working together in this moment, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2507.06s)]
*  knowing what the MRT is. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2509.82s)]
*  Why then do you have the mayor, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2511.82s)]
*  he comes out about 24 hours later and says, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2514.02s)]
*  by the way, this is a technique not trained by the MPD. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2518.66s)]
*  This is Jacob Fry. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2523.74s)]
*  Correct. Who is he? [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2524.8199999999997s)]
*  Is he from Minneapolis? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2526.62s)]
*  No, from Virginia. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2527.8199999999997s)]
*  He was brought to Minneapolis to run for city council. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2529.14s)]
*  And then- By whom? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2532.2999999999997s)]
*  The mayor, good question. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2533.74s)]
*  He's not, he has nothing to do with Minneapolis at all. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2536.06s)]
*  And he winds up- [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2538.18s)]
*  No. Becoming mayor. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2539.14s)]
*  And in many ways, destroying Minneapolis. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2540.7799999999997s)]
*  Is he still there? [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2543.2599999999998s)]
*  He's still there. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2544.18s)]
*  Is he still the mayor? He's still the mayor. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2545.42s)]
*  Why isn't he in prison? [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2548.18s)]
*  You know, I've gone to him for more interview requests [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2550.8199999999997s)]
*  at this point than I can count. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2553.58s)]
*  At one point, I just started chasing him around [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2554.7s)]
*  one morning to try to get him to answer questions. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2557.8199999999997s)]
*  It's kind of funny that somebody would be [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2560.22s)]
*  literally running away from me, but that's what he did. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2561.8199999999997s)]
*  But I just, so my question is, why are you lying? [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2564.14s)]
*  Why have you been lying about all this? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2566.1s)]
*  Because we saw this again, this five years later, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2567.74s)]
*  these stories are just so over the top [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2571.22s)]
*  and nobody is telling the truth about it [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2573.7799999999997s)]
*  even five years later. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2575.62s)]
*  It's almost as if you just continue to repeat this lie, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2576.66s)]
*  you know, enough people will believe it. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2579.98s)]
*  The mayor, Jacob Fry, who's not from Minneapolis, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2582.1s)]
*  was brought in and somehow becomes mayor [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2584.66s)]
*  and then wrecks the city that he's not from. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2586.98s)]
*  Didn't build. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2589.3799999999997s)]
*  He says in public, shortly after the death, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2591.1s)]
*  that the restraint technique the police officers used [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2595.8199999999997s)]
*  on George Floyd was not taught to them. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2598.58s)]
*  Correct. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2600.7s)]
*  And that's not true. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2602.1s)]
*  Yeah, these pages go missing of the manual. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2603.8599999999997s)]
*  Which explain the technique. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2606.86s)]
*  Exactly, and I said into my newsroom at the time, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2608.62s)]
*  this is really quite something. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2611.62s)]
*  They are trying to cover this up. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2613.1s)]
*  We should really be doing a story about this. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2615.7s)]
*  And I'm the crazy person. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2618.3399999999997s)]
*  What did they say? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2620.46s)]
*  It was just like, you have to go along with this narrative. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2621.74s)]
*  This is the narrative of the moment [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2625.06s)]
*  and we are going to push it on the public. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2627.14s)]
*  We even had reporters using Black Lives Matter [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2629.2999999999997s)]
*  as hashtags in their reporting. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2632.2999999999997s)]
*  Not really. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2634.42s)]
*  And that was allowed. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2635.6200000000003s)]
*  And I said, well, here's their website [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2637.34s)]
*  and this is a political organization. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2639.0600000000004s)]
*  Why would we allow this ever? [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2640.7000000000003s)]
*  But again, I'm the crazy conservative, I guess, [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2646.3s)]
*  in the newsroom at this point. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2650.34s)]
*  That was the corner I was cast in. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2651.6200000000003s)]
*  And I should just shut up. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2654.26s)]
*  I guess this is why I've forgotten some of the details [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2658.1000000000004s)]
*  because they're just horrifying. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2660.0200000000004s)]
*  So the public doesn't get to know [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2661.2200000000003s)]
*  that the restraint technique that the police officers, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2663.86s)]
*  not just Derek Chauvin, but the other three, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2666.1000000000004s)]
*  used against this berserk drug addict, convicted felon, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2668.5s)]
*  that that was a technique that they learned [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2673.54s)]
*  at the police academy. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2675.3s)]
*  Trained for decades. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2677.1400000000003s)]
*  Trained for decades. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2678.34s)]
*  We found manuals with the MRT in the 90s. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2680.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, we did a lot of research. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2684.6600000000003s)]
*  Did they apply it correctly? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2685.98s)]
*  Did they do what they were taught to do? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2686.9s)]
*  It's actually in there to wait, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2688.98s)]
*  to hold and wait for EMS. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2691.66s)]
*  This is also something else that was never talked about. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2693.98s)]
*  The ambulance went to the wrong address, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2697.62s)]
*  which is why there is such a long, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2700.3399999999997s)]
*  typically an ambulance would be there [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2702.1s)]
*  in about 90 seconds at the most. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2703.74s)]
*  There's a fire station that close. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2705.62s)]
*  They went to the wrong address. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2708.58s)]
*  And you see this on the body camera footage [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2709.74s)]
*  that one of the paramedics is almost joking around [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2712.46s)]
*  with Thomas Lane going, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2715.3399999999997s)]
*  "'Gosh, we didn't know where you guys were. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2716.46s)]
*  We went to the wrong place. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2717.7s)]
*  It's why it took us so long.'" [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2718.74s)]
*  And there's a very problematic EMS response to all of this. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2721.22s)]
*  That is also not allowed to be discussed [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2724.7s)]
*  in Chauvin's trial either. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2727.22s)]
*  What's the problematic EMS response? [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2729.2599999999998s)]
*  The fact that they go to the wrong address. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2731.2999999999997s)]
*  They also are hooking George Floyd up [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2733.58s)]
*  to get air or to breathe. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2736.22s)]
*  And the machine itself is not plugged in in the ambulance. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2740.66s)]
*  You know, there has been- [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2746.14s)]
*  The machine is not plugged in? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2746.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2748.5s)]
*  This is all in the documentary. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2749.54s)]
*  Did anybody hit him with Narcan? [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2752.7s)]
*  You know, that's a question I get quite a bit. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2755.58s)]
*  And this is before, you know, [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2757.34s)]
*  this is more than five years ago at this point [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2760.2599999999998s)]
*  where they didn't even, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2763.2599999999998s)]
*  the officers didn't all have Narcan at that point. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2764.38s)]
*  This is kind of just the beginnings of all of that. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2767.42s)]
*  And you also had two officers that were brand new [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2769.94s)]
*  and they were partnered together. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2774.66s)]
*  And I think you can see even just with their interactions, [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2776.7799999999997s)]
*  they understand something is going on with him. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2780.0600000000004s)]
*  He also stuffed some, you know, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2781.98s)]
*  what you think are drugs in his mouth [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2784.3s)]
*  during their interaction. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2786.7400000000002s)]
*  And they're asking him, what do you want? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2788.26s)]
*  What did you take? [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2789.7000000000003s)]
*  And, you know, he's very combative, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2790.54s)]
*  but they think it's more of a, [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2792.0600000000004s)]
*  something is going on medically. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2793.7000000000003s)]
*  They try to get him into the squad car. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2794.98s)]
*  It's George Floyd himself who asks to be laid on the ground. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2796.7000000000003s)]
*  Many people don't know that. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2799.82s)]
*  He asks to be laid on the ground himself. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2801.6200000000003s)]
*  And this is just this hold that they do. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2804.42s)]
*  But we quickly find out, again, it's within 12 hours [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2808.34s)]
*  that in his autopsy, you can see that, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2811.82s)]
*  he's been described to us as a ticking time bomb, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2814.2200000000003s)]
*  sadly, George Floyd. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2817.34s)]
*  He has this tumor, a paraganglioma, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2818.58s)]
*  that more testing isn't done on that. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2822.34s)]
*  And that can lead to, in his hip, a large tumor. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2825.34s)]
*  And that can lead to death [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2829.02s)]
*  when people are in that hyped state, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2830.46s)]
*  which clearly George Floyd is. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2833.6600000000003s)]
*  You can see on his face when you watch the video [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2834.5s)]
*  that he knows he's dying. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2836.7400000000002s)]
*  And he's panicked. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2838.6200000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2839.6600000000003s)]
*  I'll speak for myself and say, I really fell for the guy. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2840.5s)]
*  You can see the terror in his eyes. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2842.38s)]
*  Like he's on his way out. [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2844.1800000000003s)]
*  He's not ready for it. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2845.1000000000004s)]
*  You know, God knows where he's going. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2846.78s)]
*  And he knows, he knows that. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2848.26s)]
*  And, but it's just obvious from the video [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2850.9s)]
*  that it has nothing to do with how he's being treated [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2854.78s)]
*  by the cops. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2856.42s)]
*  Like that's why he's freaking out, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2857.26s)]
*  because he knows he's dying. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2859.06s)]
*  Did you feel that watching? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2860.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, I have been a kind of a cops reporter, [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2862.26s)]
*  I guess, for years. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2864.78s)]
*  But you always know that there's more to this. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2865.6600000000003s)]
*  And also quickly we learned within those first couple days, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2867.82s)]
*  he'd been arrested in 2019 [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2870.6200000000003s)]
*  by the Minneapolis Police Department. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2872.5800000000004s)]
*  He was the subject of an undercover drug investigation, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2873.86s)]
*  George Floyd. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2876.54s)]
*  Again, something people had no idea. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2877.6200000000003s)]
*  Almost exactly a year prior. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2879.2200000000003s)]
*  And police have an interaction with him, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2881.42s)]
*  and he has an overdose. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2883.38s)]
*  It's almost a carbon copy of the interaction. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2885.3s)]
*  Don't shoot me. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2887.6600000000003s)]
*  He's very resistant. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2889.1400000000003s)]
*  Is this on video? [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2891.5s)]
*  Saying, I can't breathe. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2892.34s)]
*  Yes, it's all on video. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2893.3s)]
*  And that's actually how we start our documentary. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2894.7000000000003s)]
*  Did that introduce to his trial? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2897.02s)]
*  In fact, the police say that the police chief says [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2898.46s)]
*  they've never heard of George Floyd before, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2902.9s)]
*  they have no idea who he is. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2904.14s)]
*  And that's in shortly after. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2905.54s)]
*  The police chief says that? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2906.94s)]
*  Why would he say that? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2908.5s)]
*  That's a whole nother. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2910.82s)]
*  Yeah, the police chief at the time is Madera Arradondo. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2912.02s)]
*  He's serving in that capacity. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2916.9s)]
*  Is he from Minneapolis? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2918.7400000000002s)]
*  He's from Minneapolis. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2919.7400000000002s)]
*  But many people on the department, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2921.46s)]
*  they feel that he just sold their entire department out. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2923.7799999999997s)]
*  Where is he now? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2927.4599999999996s)]
*  Looking for a job, I think. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2929.3799999999997s)]
*  He's selling a book. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2931.4199999999996s)]
*  May he long be unemployed. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2933.5s)]
*  Is he an ally of Jacob Fries? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2934.8999999999996s)]
*  Yes, I mean, certainly. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2937.3799999999997s)]
*  Yes, the mayor and the chief worked alongside each other. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2938.8199999999997s)]
*  But you also have this chief who then [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2942.1s)]
*  makes this all about race. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2946.02s)]
*  He embraces that also. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2947.5s)]
*  And again, when it's so clear, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2950.9799999999996s)]
*  the evidence doesn't support that at all. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2952.3s)]
*  You have a Hmong American officer in Tutow, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2954.1000000000004s)]
*  a black officer in Alex King, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2957.1400000000003s)]
*  and then Thomas Lane and Derek Chauvin who are white. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2959.54s)]
*  And they sold this to the public as this is the- [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2962.6600000000003s)]
*  The face of white supremacy. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2965.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2966.9s)]
*  And all these repulsive preachers [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2967.98s)]
*  got up there and Protestant churches [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2970.1000000000004s)]
*  and sold that to their congregations, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2973.5800000000004s)]
*  all these politicians. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2975.82s)]
*  Like basically every leader, every business leader, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2976.9s)]
*  the entire leadership class of the country [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2980.46s)]
*  pivoted behind this lie within 24 hours. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2982.38s)]
*  Nikki Haley was like, [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2985.78s)]
*  "'We need Minneapolis to burn down. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2986.78s)]
*  "'It'll be an atonement for the sins of white supremacy.'" [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2988.66s)]
*  I mean, it was like, never seen anything like it. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2991.62s)]
*  What was that? [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2995.9s)]
*  Like it really felt like this was a play [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=2997.3s)]
*  that they had planned for this day. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3001.62s)]
*  You had Governor Walz saying these same things. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3004.82s)]
*  Again, fanning the flames, withholding the National Guard, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3008.22s)]
*  encouraging people to basically show up and protest. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3011.1s)]
*  You had his wife speak on camera [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3016.22s)]
*  about how she left the windows open [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3018.3399999999997s)]
*  to the governor's mansion [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3020.02s)]
*  so she could smell the burning tires [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3021.18s)]
*  just to really appreciate the movement and the moment. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3024.2599999999998s)]
*  The Winnie Mandela of Minnesota, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3028.02s)]
*  necklacing her enemies. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3030.4199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Crazy. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3032.8599999999997s)]
*  And it of course changed the country forever. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3034.54s)]
*  So, but it did, [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3038.2999999999997s)]
*  but the response felt coordinated, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3040.3799999999997s)]
*  I guess that's what I'm saying. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3044.74s)]
*  Was it? [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3046.3799999999997s)]
*  You did. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3047.22s)]
*  You had planes filled with people [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3048.06s)]
*  coming in shortly after protest. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3051.06s)]
*  Planes filled with people? [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3053.8199999999997s)]
*  I've spoken to people that work at the airport [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3055.22s)]
*  that have told me about that. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3056.8999999999996s)]
*  People that would just, a lot of young kids. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3059.3399999999997s)]
*  We had people at our house who admitted to us [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3061.22s)]
*  that they came from Oregon. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3063.22s)]
*  They had no idea who we were. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3065.3799999999997s)]
*  They were holding signs in our neighborhood, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3066.74s)]
*  but they got a free weekend at a hotel. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3069.2999999999997s)]
*  So they came to our suburban neighborhood [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3071.4199999999996s)]
*  to hold a sign in front of our yard. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3074.1s)]
*  Who paid for all this? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3075.9399999999996s)]
*  Well, and that's what's always bothered me as a reporter. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3077.58s)]
*  Also, this is all, these are all things you can track down. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3080.3399999999997s)]
*  These are all public documents. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3084.8599999999997s)]
*  But yes, these left-wing groups, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3087.3399999999997s)]
*  George Soros had a role, that's pretty clear. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3088.98s)]
*  And many of these groups that popped up, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3091.7799999999997s)]
*  Black Lives Matter played a big role in all of this. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3095.58s)]
*  Again, you follow the money, you follow the power, [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3099.86s)]
*  and that's kind of where the truth usually is. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3102.66s)]
*  And Black Lives Matter got its funding [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3104.94s)]
*  mostly from corporate America, I think. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3106.46s)]
*  Yes, and many Minnesota corporations fed into that. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3109.06s)]
*  You see some of that going away now, thankfully. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3114.7799999999997s)]
*  But you had George Floyd Memorial Field at Target Field, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3118.42s)]
*  where the Minnesota Twins play. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3121.7799999999997s)]
*  Not really. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3122.94s)]
*  Really, for years. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3123.7799999999997s)]
*  The drug addict, porn star, armed robber, [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3126.1400000000003s)]
*  they named the field after him? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3127.58s)]
*  He's the civic hero in Minnesota now? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3129.5s)]
*  They had a banner. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3130.94s)]
*  Again, thankfully, that's now been taken down. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3132.06s)]
*  But they called it George Floyd Memorial Field? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3134.6200000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3137.1800000000003s)]
*  The Episcopal Cathedral in San Francisco, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3140.54s)]
*  where I was baptized, I visited it shortly after that, [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3142.54s)]
*  and they had a St. George Floyd pennant [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3146.1800000000003s)]
*  that you could kind of hang in your house. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3151.02s)]
*  It's a beautiful icon. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3154.2599999999998s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3155.46s)]
*  I mean, even that area, 38th and Chicago, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3156.2999999999997s)]
*  most of the businesses are gone. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3158.02s)]
*  In fact, talk about irony, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3159.8999999999996s)]
*  the businesses are suing the city of Minneapolis [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3162.1s)]
*  for a lack of police presence in that area. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3164.74s)]
*  You've had skyrocketing crime since. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3168.62s)]
*  The mantra was that we'd be living [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3173.2999999999997s)]
*  on the right side of history. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3174.7599999999998s)]
*  This is what we were told over and over again, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3176.14s)]
*  whether it be our governor, the mayor, the police chief, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3178.46s)]
*  this is the right side of history. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3181.8999999999996s)]
*  And I've yet to find anyone who actually thinks [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3183.2599999999998s)]
*  that we're living there. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3185.22s)]
*  At the time, so the trial, the riots happened, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3187.8199999999997s)]
*  how many people died during the riots, do you recall? [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3190.18s)]
*  It's been reported about five or six, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3193.4599999999996s)]
*  but again, do you tie them just to the most expensive riots [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3195.58s)]
*  in US history, 1,500 businesses either damaged or destroyed [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3199.06s)]
*  in the wake of them. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3204.06s)]
*  Then the trial happens. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3206.62s)]
*  Does anybody in Minneapolis, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3208.7799999999997s)]
*  in any position of authority or in the media say, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3211.14s)]
*  hey, wait a second, there's no evidence [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3213.62s)]
*  that these cops killed this guy? [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3215.18s)]
*  Nope. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3218.1s)]
*  Nobody said that. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3218.94s)]
*  No, my husband. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3220.26s)]
*  We saw what happened to him. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3223.9s)]
*  And he just, he's a believer of due process. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3225.7000000000003s)]
*  He's a, they obviously had attorneys, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3228.02s)]
*  but even the attorneys representing these officers [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3231.9s)]
*  were not very vocal in all of this. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3234.26s)]
*  It's almost like the truth just didn't stand. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3237.7400000000002s)]
*  So one of the lessons is, [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3239.38s)]
*  and this is just the ugliest feature of human nature, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3240.54s)]
*  that if someone or something becomes super unpopular [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3243.3799999999997s)]
*  or only an infinitesimally small number of people [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3246.8599999999997s)]
*  are brave enough to stand up and tell the truth. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3249.3799999999997s)]
*  Like if the, once the mob forms, [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3254.46s)]
*  almost everybody goes along with it. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3256.8999999999996s)]
*  Was that, did you know that before this happened? [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3259.98s)]
*  Not on this level, no. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3262.46s)]
*  And that's why I kept speaking up. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3264.2599999999998s)]
*  I kept going, well, hey, there's this, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3265.66s)]
*  hey, let's do this story. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3266.98s)]
*  Hey, there's, and then it just became very clear to me, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3268.02s)]
*  like this is scary. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3270.46s)]
*  This is scary. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3273.62s)]
*  This is what the world has turned into. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3274.46s)]
*  This is what the media has turned into. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3277.58s)]
*  They just lynched these guys [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3279.42s)]
*  and everyone kind of posed with pictures of the corpse. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3281.14s)]
*  Like it's just exactly what you read about [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3284.9s)]
*  in dark times long ago. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3287.38s)]
*  And it happens in Minneapolis, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3289.62s)]
*  like the most civilized American city we've ever had. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3290.94s)]
*  The most polite city in the world. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3294.9s)]
*  You have the mayor crying at George Floyd's casket [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3296.78s)]
*  at his funeral. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3301.34s)]
*  People couldn't gather for COVID, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3302.38s)]
*  but yet George Floyd had a highly attended funeral [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3303.9s)]
*  and you could protest in a riot that was encouraged. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3307.5800000000004s)]
*  George Floyd's dead and I already said [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3309.86s)]
*  I felt sorry for him watching the video [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3311.2200000000003s)]
*  because he knew he was dying and like, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3313.02s)]
*  it's scary for people who haven't prepared for it, I think. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3315.94s)]
*  But is there any evidence now that we know more [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3319.7000000000003s)]
*  about George Floyd the man, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3322.1400000000003s)]
*  that George Floyd ever did anything to improve our society [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3323.6200000000003s)]
*  or help anybody else or did any virtuous [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3326.22s)]
*  or redeeming things ever? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3328.66s)]
*  No, there's actually been so much [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3330.74s)]
*  that has not been reported about him. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3331.98s)]
*  I mean, clearly he was an addict. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3335.3799999999997s)]
*  He struggled as an addict for most of his adult life. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3336.7799999999997s)]
*  He spent most of his adult life in and out of prison. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3339.8199999999997s)]
*  That's documented. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3342.3799999999997s)]
*  But even his, he was from St. Louis Park. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3346.3799999999997s)]
*  He didn't even live in Minneapolis. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3349.58s)]
*  He lived in St. Louis Park, a suburb with his roommates. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3350.74s)]
*  And his roommates have talked about how his family [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3353.3399999999997s)]
*  never even came to gather his personal belongings. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3355.26s)]
*  They were just left there. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3358.3s)]
*  His car was still there. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3359.3s)]
*  I mean, like a year later. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3360.5800000000004s)]
*  His family all got rich, right? [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3362.78s)]
*  They were paid $27 million [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3364.94s)]
*  during Derek Chauvin's jury selection. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3367.46s)]
*  They were awarded $27 million. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3371.2200000000003s)]
*  What do you think kind of message that sent [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3372.9s)]
*  to the jury being seated at that time? [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3375.5s)]
*  Why is it Trump pardoned him? [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3376.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, it's a little bit more complicated. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3379.42s)]
*  There were rumors about that perhaps happening, [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3381.42s)]
*  but then he would be brought back to a state facility [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3383.98s)]
*  where he'd be in, you know, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3386.94s)]
*  he'd be in solitary confinement for sure. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3390.14s)]
*  And walls- [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3392.62s)]
*  So even if the president pardoned him on federal charges, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3393.46s)]
*  he'd still be in- [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3395.18s)]
*  He has a concurrent state sentence. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3396.02s)]
*  And they've all can't find enough microphones [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3398.34s)]
*  to talk about how they can't wait for that to happen [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3403.3s)]
*  because they would love him to serve [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3405.38s)]
*  every last hour in Minnesota. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3406.2200000000003s)]
*  Of course they don't like him. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3407.58s)]
*  Why not send the National Guard in [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3408.42s)]
*  and just liberate him with, by force? [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3409.26s)]
*  I mean, this is like, this is insane [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3411.62s)]
*  that we would allow something like this. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3413.14s)]
*  Yeah, he has at this point, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3414.74s)]
*  more than 15 years left on his sentence. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3417.2999999999997s)]
*  Federal. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3419.7s)]
*  They are concurrent sentences, so yes. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3420.94s)]
*  How old is he? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3423.42s)]
*  At this point, he would be, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3425.74s)]
*  oh my gosh, that's a, you might have to edit this out. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3429.66s)]
*  He's a middle-aged man. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3431.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3432.9s)]
*  So he'll be an elderly man by the time he gets out. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3433.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think he would be in his 60s [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3436.22s)]
*  by the time of his release. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3438.02s)]
*  Most of his life gone, for sure. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3440.58s)]
*  But so back to George Floyd, who was, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3442.58s)]
*  George Floyd spent most of his life in and out of prison. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3445.86s)]
*  He was a drug addict. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3448.94s)]
*  He appeared in a porn film. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3450.1s)]
*  It's too perfect. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3452.7s)]
*  He was at one point convicted of armed robbery [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3453.54s)]
*  where he stuck a gun in the belly of a pregnant woman. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3456.1s)]
*  Am I misremembering this? [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3458.3s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3460.58s)]
*  He committed a home invasion. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3461.42s)]
*  It doesn't seem to be clear that she was pregnant, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3465.34s)]
*  but yeah, pretty awful person, I think, [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3468.38s)]
*  capable of doing that at all. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3470.3s)]
*  But he came then to Minneapolis [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3474.46s)]
*  and I know he was fired from a couple of jobs. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3477.26s)]
*  He was working and basically hooking up with people [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3480.42s)]
*  at one job that he had, addicts, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3486.26s)]
*  and bringing them back to his home, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3489.1800000000003s)]
*  something that's not allowed. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3490.9s)]
*  And in fact, in the book I detail, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3492.46s)]
*  he was the suspect in a couple of rapes in Minnesota, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3494.42s)]
*  where that evidence has mysteriously disappeared. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3499.66s)]
*  What? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3501.62s)]
*  What does it mean to be a suspect in rapes? [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3503.66s)]
*  Like the police? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3505.38s)]
*  The police were investigating. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3506.3s)]
*  He was being accused of rape. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3509.38s)]
*  And this was the hero after whom they named the ballpark? [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3516.54s)]
*  Still shocking to this day, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3520.7400000000002s)]
*  but is this how far we've fallen as a society? [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3522.54s)]
*  What has happened to the moral compass? [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3525.3s)]
*  It's not even a fall. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3528.46s)]
*  It's like it's an attack, [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3529.62s)]
*  not by the population itself, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3532.82s)]
*  but by its leaders trying to invert virtue [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3535.42s)]
*  and make you worship a rapist. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3538.58s)]
*  And St. George Floyd, [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3541.46s)]
*  if they can make you worship someone like that, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3542.78s)]
*  the lowest person in your society, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3546.82s)]
*  truly the lowest stupid, criminal, violent, selfish, [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3548.66s)]
*  addicts are selfish by definition. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3553.18s)]
*  If that's the hero they can make you worship, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3555.5s)]
*  then they flip the society upside down and they destroy it. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3559.1400000000003s)]
*  Governor Walz at one point asked for all public schools, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3561.6200000000003s)]
*  kids to be silent for nine minutes and 29 seconds, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3565.38s)]
*  the timeframe, he did that in a declaration. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3571.46s)]
*  Many people I heard from did not. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3577.0600000000004s)]
*  But they literally, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3578.78s)]
*  the public schools were required to worship George Floyd. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3579.82s)]
*  Correct. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3581.94s)]
*  Okay. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3585.0600000000004s)]
*  A couple of threads I just wanna get to. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3586.9s)]
*  So I think you're a rigorous, honest person. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3588.38s)]
*  Do you see any way an honest jury or an honest process [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3592.82s)]
*  could result in the conviction of Chauvin and the other three? [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3598.38s)]
*  No. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3603.58s)]
*  I mean, if our judicial system is what it says it is, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3604.42s)]
*  when you're presented with all of the evidence [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3608.54s)]
*  and all of the facts and you take out all of the manipulation, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3610.46s)]
*  the fear mongering, again, you had even Chauvin's trial, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3614.14s)]
*  armed guards are standing by, [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3620.2999999999997s)]
*  the Hennepin County courthouse is being patrolled [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3623.34s)]
*  by this militia in a sense, [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3626.38s)]
*  there are all these dispensing is put up around the building. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3628.66s)]
*  The jury is not sequestered for the trial. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3632.62s)]
*  You have these mobs of people out protesting every day. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3634.86s)]
*  I don't think anybody in their right mind is gonna say, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3638.02s)]
*  yeah, this guy is innocent [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3641.14s)]
*  because then I'm gonna probably be protested or killed [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3642.46s)]
*  or lose my job or whatever it is in the fallout. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3645.54s)]
*  Again, I had nothing, really nothing to do with this. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3648.86s)]
*  And I was demoted and canceled. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3652.34s)]
*  I just don't see how Ted Cruz and the rest can say [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3655.46s)]
*  that Iran is the biggest threat to a country [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3659.3s)]
*  in which things like this are happening. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3661.42s)]
*  This is the threat, the attack on truth and fairness, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3663.38s)]
*  decency, the love of people for each other, [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3666.86s)]
*  the cohesiveness of your society, citizenship, virtue, [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3669.9s)]
*  like all of it is dying [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3674.1400000000003s)]
*  because it's being overwhelmed by evil. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3677.54s)]
*  And yet you look, your focus is outside the country [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3679.6200000000003s)]
*  on some theoretical threat. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3683.2200000000003s)]
*  We wish somebody would come to Minnesota [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3684.5s)]
*  and save us Tucker. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3685.86s)]
*  No, but it's just like, look, I'm not saying Iran's not [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3687.5s)]
*  hardly for Iran or for them having a nuclear weapon, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3690.06s)]
*  but compared to what, like this is our country [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3693.34s)]
*  and this happened and no one's ever apologized, [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3696.3s)]
*  no one's ever been held accountable. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3698.54s)]
*  The guys who didn't do the crime are still in prison. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3700.22s)]
*  It's like, it's crazy that this could happen [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3703.38s)]
*  because fairness really matters. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3706.46s)]
*  If your society is not fair, it's not worth defending. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3707.86s)]
*  Even speaking to Tutel's family, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3710.62s)]
*  they are a family of refugees. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3712.62s)]
*  Both of sets of their parents came to America [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3714.82s)]
*  and they talked about that with me. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3718.1s)]
*  It's like they picked the wrong country. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3719.94s)]
*  And they said that this is not what we thought America was. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3720.7799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, okay, I didn't think that either. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3723.9s)]
*  And I was born here. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3725.2599999999998s)]
*  No, I agree. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3726.14s)]
*  Sorry, sorry for the constant editorializing. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3727.7s)]
*  What you're saying is so, and the way you're saying it, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3729.94s)]
*  which is like flat, just the facts, ma'am, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3732.62s)]
*  it's driving me insane. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3736.66s)]
*  I can't, how could you still live there? [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3738.8199999999997s)]
*  Job security, Tucker. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3741.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3742.3799999999997s)]
*  If you're one of five reporters in the entire state, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3744.2599999999998s)]
*  like you'll work forever. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3747.22s)]
*  Amazing. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3750.3799999999997s)]
*  So who is Tim Walz exactly? [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3752.02s)]
*  Most of us, I just wanna say, I think he's like, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3754.5s)]
*  should be investigated by the sex crimes unit. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3758.5s)]
*  I really feel that way. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3759.8999999999996s)]
*  I'm not asking you to comment on that, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3762.8599999999997s)]
*  but he's one of the creepiest people I've ever seen. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3764.02s)]
*  The vibe I get off that guy, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3766.46s)]
*  I would not let him in my house. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3768.2599999999998s)]
*  That's just my feeling. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3769.62s)]
*  Maybe I'm being totally unfair, in which case I apologize. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3770.58s)]
*  But you have the facts, I don't. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3774.18s)]
*  Who is this guy? [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3775.94s)]
*  Yeah, I think so much of this has happened [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3777.8199999999997s)]
*  on the watch of Governor Walz. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3780.2599999999998s)]
*  Again, I'm talking about, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3782.06s)]
*  I've lived in Minnesota for most of my life at this point [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3783.42s)]
*  and I've been a reporter there for 20 years. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3787.7s)]
*  Born there. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3789.4199999999996s)]
*  I've just never, born there, born, raised, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3790.2599999999998s)]
*  spent a little time outside of the state [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3792.14s)]
*  and been back for 20 years now. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3793.54s)]
*  But I've just never seen this kind of, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3796.3399999999997s)]
*  I don't even know if you can call it leadership. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3802.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure, manipulation by a leader. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3804.3799999999997s)]
*  Again, we've talked about this capital of chaos. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3811.22s)]
*  This has all been under his watch. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3813.18s)]
*  But we've done so much reporting over at Alpha News [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3815.82s)]
*  with the truth of this guy. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3818.82s)]
*  It was interesting to see others finally report about him [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3819.9s)]
*  because the local media will not, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3822.38s)]
*  when he was picked as the VP candidate for Kamala Harris. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3824.38s)]
*  But it started sort of with picking up [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3828.5400000000004s)]
*  on just these little lies he would tell. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3831.2200000000003s)]
*  And these are things that we would report on. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3834.0600000000004s)]
*  He never was a command sergeant major, [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3839.42s)]
*  despite the fact him saying that he was. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3841.5s)]
*  He never attained this rank in the military. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3844.74s)]
*  Instead, he abandoned his troops [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3847.4199999999996s)]
*  and they were deployed to Iraq without him [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3849.9399999999996s)]
*  and he ran for Congress. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3852.3799999999997s)]
*  So I've always felt as a reporter, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3854.66s)]
*  if someone lies about little things, [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3856.2999999999997s)]
*  they're lying about big things. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3858.06s)]
*  I think that's just, you know. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3859.9399999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's a principle that stands the test of time. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3862.54s)]
*  And you kind of would just see this [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3866.3799999999997s)]
*  with little things that he would say [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3868.18s)]
*  that was just not reality. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3870.3399999999997s)]
*  But Minnesota has become the home [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3872.5s)]
*  of this defund the police movement. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3874.86s)]
*  It was on the ballot. [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3877.66s)]
*  Minneapolis did not vote to defund the police, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3878.94s)]
*  but I would say in every way, shape or form, [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3880.98s)]
*  they defunded the police. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3883.02s)]
*  You have the Minneapolis Police Department [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3885.5s)]
*  that's lost about 40% of their cops since George Floyd. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3887.7s)]
*  But instead of being a- [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3892.94s)]
*  Wait, Minneapolis lost 40% of its cops in five years? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3893.78s)]
*  Nearly half, yeah. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3897.22s)]
*  And I actually think we're just now getting to the point of [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3899.18s)]
*  you thought there were problems with the police [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3903.34s)]
*  five years ago, just wait until you see some of these people [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3905.2200000000003s)]
*  that are coming up on the job. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3909.02s)]
*  Yeah, who's gonna be a cop now? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3909.86s)]
*  Exactly, it's pretty horrifying. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3910.7000000000003s)]
*  And I don't blame any of these people for leaving. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3913.82s)]
*  But there's me hiring criminals. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3916.5s)]
*  It'll just be a criminal gang. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3918.06s)]
*  That's happened before. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3919.34s)]
*  So under walls, we have the riots. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3920.7400000000002s)]
*  We have these lies just about things with his background [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3923.7400000000002s)]
*  that I think really deserve more attention, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3927.1800000000003s)]
*  and I think that's why he's been creating these ties [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3931.82s)]
*  to China, which I think are troubling. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3933.1400000000003s)]
*  What ties does he have to China? [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3935.46s)]
*  Well, we know himself, [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3937.42s)]
*  he said that he's made more than 30 trips to China. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3939.94s)]
*  He went there upon graduating- [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3943.6200000000003s)]
*  30 trips to China? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3945.46s)]
*  Went there upon graduating. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3947.5s)]
*  That's a long flight. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3948.6600000000003s)]
*  And he's, I mean, he spent his life, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3950.1400000000003s)]
*  he's like a school teacher. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3952.7400000000002s)]
*  He's from Nebraska, originally. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3954.06s)]
*  What is the school teacher from Nebraska [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3955.86s)]
*  making 30 trips to China? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3959.7400000000002s)]
*  And in the National Guard at the time as well, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3961.18s)]
*  making these trips to China. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3963.3799999999997s)]
*  We also know he started a- [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3966.54s)]
*  But what was, what's that? [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3968.06s)]
*  Travel agency? First of all, it's really expensive. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3970.14s)]
*  It's time consuming. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3971.7799999999997s)]
*  It's not something that happens. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3973.7s)]
*  You don't go to China 30 times [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3974.54s)]
*  unless you have a real reason to do that. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3976.3399999999997s)]
*  What would that reason be? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3977.8599999999997s)]
*  He was taking kids over there at one point [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3979.02s)]
*  as a travel agency. Oh, I bet. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3981.94s)]
*  But what's interesting is I've spoken to- [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3984.2599999999998s)]
*  Who let their kids travel with Tim Walls? [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3985.1s)]
*  I've spoken to a few of them [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3987.3399999999997s)]
*  that they're obviously older now. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3988.46s)]
*  They were in their 20s [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3990.3s)]
*  when they would make these trips in college. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3991.1400000000003s)]
*  One student in particular is very interesting. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3993.2200000000003s)]
*  He said that he'd been trying to get the attention [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3995.78s)]
*  of the media about this guy for years. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=3998.34s)]
*  He said he would go there on these trips [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4000.3s)]
*  and collect the little red Mao book. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4002.0600000000004s)]
*  He would buy as many as he could on these trips [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4004.94s)]
*  saying that they were souvenirs, Tim Walls would. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4006.7400000000002s)]
*  And he said it was very apparent he just had this, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4009.7000000000003s)]
*  he adored communism and would talk about it in conversation. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4014.3s)]
*  These students could pick up on that. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4019.78s)]
*  Are you serious? [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4023.6200000000003s)]
*  And this student tried, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4024.46s)]
*  even when he was running for Congress, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4026.6200000000003s)]
*  to say there's more to this guy that you guys need to meet. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4028.02s)]
*  Mao killed so many more people than Hitler [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4030.3s)]
*  that it's not even close. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4031.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4032.98s)]
*  Not a defensive Hitler who was evil. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4033.82s)]
*  But Mao is the greatest mass murderer in history. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4035.6200000000003s)]
*  He's also married his wedding anniversary. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4038.0600000000004s)]
*  They were married five years after Tiananmen Square [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4042.6200000000003s)]
*  and he picked that date because it was a date [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4044.78s)]
*  that they would remember, he and his wife. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4047.14s)]
*  What? [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4049.2999999999997s)]
*  Who does that? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4050.14s)]
*  Tiananmen Square? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4050.98s)]
*  Correct. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4052.2999999999997s)]
*  The tank crushing the lone protester, that's? [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4053.14s)]
*  Their wedding anniversary. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4055.7799999999997s)]
*  And they went to China for their honeymoon. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4056.98s)]
*  Come on. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4059.58s)]
*  I mean, I was in this country during that campaign. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4062.14s)]
*  It was less than a year ago. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4065.1s)]
*  I never heard anybody say that. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4066.18s)]
*  But again, you have in Minnesota what has happened. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4067.98s)]
*  We have a new state flag. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4070.66s)]
*  Wait, wait, do you think, I'm sorry, [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4072.18s)]
*  I'm just mesmerized by this. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4074.18s)]
*  There's a lot of questions, I agree. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4075.02s)]
*  Questions. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4076.5s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem is there's not anybody [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4077.34s)]
*  looking for answers, it seems like. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4079.26s)]
*  Well, they wanna kill themselves. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4081.26s)]
*  So they're doing a great job. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4082.3s)]
*  I get it. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4085.3s)]
*  I mean, ultimately, I just have to say this. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4086.1400000000003s)]
*  As a white man, I do blame the liberal whites. [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4088.6600000000003s)]
*  They want to kill themselves and their kids. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4091.02s)]
*  That's what they're into. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4093.82s)]
*  I don't know what it's, what you see it in Britain. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4095.3s)]
*  So I'm not into suicide. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4098.22s)]
*  So I'm opposed, but they're the ones doing this [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4099.34s)]
*  and Wallace is a perfect example. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4101.82s)]
*  But why would he, you're sure he picked the anniversary? [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4103.139999999999s)]
*  They've talked about this in interviews. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4108.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, this is in newspapers. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4110.0199999999995s)]
*  Tiananmen Square was a massacre of peaceful protesters. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4111.54s)]
*  I know. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4114.58s)]
*  Was, do you think they picked it to like, [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4115.82s)]
*  in the memory of those brave souls [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4117.7s)]
*  who died opposing the machine? [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4119.58s)]
*  They haven't said that. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4121.38s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4122.5s)]
*  And what's interesting is, again, [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4124.54s)]
*  we're focusing over at Alpha News on these stories. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4126.139999999999s)]
*  There's supposed to be a congressional hearing [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4129.34s)]
*  about all of this and it's kind of just gone nowhere. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4130.94s)]
*  Sadly, we also know, I've spoken to a couple people [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4135.419999999999s)]
*  that served with Tim Walls in Nebraska in that guard unit. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4137.86s)]
*  And they suspect, and we've done stories [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4142.62s)]
*  and tried to reach out to Walls for comment, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4146.0599999999995s)]
*  but they suspect that perhaps he took [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4148.66s)]
*  their standard operating procedure, the SOP, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4151.339999999999s)]
*  for the Howitzer Army tank. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4154.099999999999s)]
*  He was assigned to this tank. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4157.74s)]
*  It was nuclear capable and this was all laid out [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4160.46s)]
*  in the SOP that goes missing while he's there. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4164.0199999999995s)]
*  And they- [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4166.98s)]
*  The manual goes missing? [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4167.82s)]
*  Right, and they had talked to the FBI about this as well. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4168.66s)]
*  There's so many questions. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4172.339999999999s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4173.179999999999s)]
*  Why did they talk to the FBI? [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4174.0199999999995s)]
*  They think that he was traveling back and forth [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4175.5s)]
*  from China at this time. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4177.74s)]
*  And then we also know that this Howitzer- [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4179.299999999999s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4181.219999999999s)]
*  I know I sound crazy right now. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4182.0599999999995s)]
*  No, no, you don't sound crazy at all. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4183.62s)]
*  You're recounting the facts. [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4185.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4187.42s)]
*  You're saying that men he worked with [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4188.26s)]
*  in the National Guard in Nebraska went to the FBI [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4190.900000000001s)]
*  because they believed he had given classified military [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4193.7s)]
*  secrets to the Chinese government? [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4197.58s)]
*  They suspect that he did and- [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4199.66s)]
*  Well, they suspect to the point that he went to the FBI. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4202.3s)]
*  Well, this was all when he, [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4204.34s)]
*  when all these stories are coming out finally [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4206.3s)]
*  about his background and they're like, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4208.22s)]
*  maybe we should talk about this. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4210.06s)]
*  These are guys that back then didn't report this. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4211.9400000000005s)]
*  This was in the early 90s. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4214.54s)]
*  And they always talked about it amongst themselves. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4215.98s)]
*  And I think that they weren't completely aware of, [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4219.46s)]
*  the potential threats, something like this could pose, [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4222.46s)]
*  but they always thought this was very strange. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4225.139999999999s)]
*  And then China started producing almost a carbon copy [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4227.139999999999s)]
*  of this military tank a couple of years later. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4230.7s)]
*  Come on. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4233.98s)]
*  For real? [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4236.0599999999995s)]
*  According to all of our research. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4237.139999999999s)]
*  Did the Minneapolis Star Tribune break this story? [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4240.82s)]
*  Oh, no, no, no. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4243.9s)]
*  They haven't touched much of this. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4245.54s)]
*  In fact, actually when they reported it's, [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4247.34s)]
*  Tim Walz goes to China with these kids [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4250.54s)]
*  and it's this great travel company he started. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4252.58s)]
*  I think it was a very small story [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4255.06s)]
*  even addressing this at all. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4257.06s)]
*  And he chose to be married on the fifth anniversary [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4259.98s)]
*  of a massacre of peaceful protesters. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4263.3s)]
*  Oh man, this is super dark. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4267.86s)]
*  I realized too that it's, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4270.22s)]
*  some of it seems like impossible to believe, [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4271.78s)]
*  but again, being trained as a reporter, [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4273.86s)]
*  you know how this works, you talk to people, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4276.34s)]
*  you verify things, you source things, [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4278.18s)]
*  and I feel very confident always in all of our information. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4279.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's what is always so frustrating to me [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4282.66s)]
*  that this should be the front page of the Star Tribune [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4285.02s)]
*  basically every day. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4287.46s)]
*  But instead the Star Tribune is run by a former commissioner [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4289.06s)]
*  of Governor Walz. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4292.38s)]
*  He's the CEO and publisher [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4293.38s)]
*  and it's truly unbelievable the stories they put out. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4295.14s)]
*  It's just turned into pure propaganda. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4299.06s)]
*  The Star Tribune is run by a former Walz commissioner? [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4302.26s)]
*  Steve Groves was his commissioner for years. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4306.42s)]
*  And I don't think this relationship actually exists [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4310.34s)]
*  anywhere in the country between a governor [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4313.26s)]
*  and a publisher of the largest newspaper, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4315.66s)]
*  but somehow in Minnesota that's allowed. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4318.26s)]
*  Who votes? [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4320.5s)]
*  So Minnesota has not thrived [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4321.34s)]
*  under the leadership of Tim Walz. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4323.1s)]
*  It's gotten much worse. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4324.46s)]
*  You were telling me today about people you know, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4328.22s)]
*  and I know people too who've moved from Minnesota to Iowa. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4329.66s)]
*  No offense to Iowa. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4333.54s)]
*  It's like the nicest people in the world. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4334.38s)]
*  It also has the worst weather of any state. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4337.02s)]
*  It's totally flat. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4340.02s)]
*  Minnesota is just beautiful. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4342.02s)]
*  Again, I'm not beating up on Iowa. [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4344.82s)]
*  I really do love Iowa. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4346.1s)]
*  I spent a lot of time there, but you know, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4347.26s)]
*  Minneapolis is kind of the dream. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4349.42s)]
*  Iowa's like sturdy farm people and all that. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4352.26s)]
*  If you're seeing a migration from Minnesota to Iowa, [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4355.78s)]
*  Minnesota is in serious trouble. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4360.26s)]
*  Is this fair? [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4362.66s)]
*  Oh, thousands of people have left. [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4363.5s)]
*  Tens of thousands of people have left Minnesota. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4365.66s)]
*  Crazy. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4367.9s)]
*  I know so many people even in my neighborhood [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4368.74s)]
*  that have moved. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4371.42s)]
*  So it's gotten so much worse under this guy [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4373.74s)]
*  who got married on the fifth anniversary [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4377.42s)]
*  of Tiananmen Square because he loves the idea [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4379.5s)]
*  of tanks mowing over protesters. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4381.5s)]
*  Who votes for him? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4386.98s)]
*  How does he get elected in the state? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4388.02s)]
*  Well, this is what's interesting. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4390.1s)]
*  The last time a Republican has held a statewide office [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4392.82s)]
*  in Minnesota was 2006. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4395.74s)]
*  It's been a while. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4398.42s)]
*  Palenty or who was that? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4399.46s)]
*  Tim Palenty when he was elected as governor. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4400.78s)]
*  We saw the House get a little closer in the legislature [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4404.66s)]
*  this time around, but the last time, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4408.38s)]
*  we had a DFL trifecta for the first time. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4411.0599999999995s)]
*  For people who aren't familiar, [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4413.9s)]
*  explain what DFL is. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4414.74s)]
*  So that's the Democratic Farm and Labor DFL, [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4415.86s)]
*  the Democratic Party. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4420.98s)]
*  It's the Democratic Party, but your state [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4421.82s)]
*  is different in lots of ways and that's why. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4423.9s)]
*  Yes, it is. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4425.86s)]
*  But I always have said that with Minnesota, [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4427.099999999999s)]
*  you have a couple of blue cities, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4429.58s)]
*  but the state is very red. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4431.0199999999995s)]
*  Probably more red now than ever before. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4433.62s)]
*  Minnesota was Democrat, but like in a German, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4435.98s)]
*  Scandinavian sort of working class, but clean, upright. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4440.139999999999s)]
*  Not in a radical way. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4443.86s)]
*  At all. [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4445.0199999999995s)]
*  Like very old fashioned labor Democrats [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4445.86s)]
*  of the kind that I kind of love. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4450.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't think we disagree on much. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4452.219999999999s)]
*  And how did it become neoliberal, nihilistic? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4453.98s)]
*  Well, even my husband talks about this. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4457.94s)]
*  He grew up as a Democrat. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4459.54s)]
*  His dad was an electrician. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4460.7s)]
*  He was a union working class. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4462.0599999999995s)]
*  That's how it worked. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4464.179999999999s)]
*  That has totally changed. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4466.62s)]
*  These are not polyamory Democrats. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4468.259999999999s)]
*  These are not Ayahuasca Democrats. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4470.459999999999s)]
*  You have like a city council though in Minneapolis [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4473.179999999999s)]
*  that primarily is, they are socialists. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4475.5s)]
*  They are self-proclaimed socialists [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4478.86s)]
*  that are running the city council of Minneapolis. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4480.58s)]
*  But we've just seen it go more and more to the left [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4483.7s)]
*  each and every year. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4486.78s)]
*  But even Walls, I will say that I don't think people [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4487.62s)]
*  were completely familiar with his background [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4490.42s)]
*  when he was elected. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4494.66s)]
*  Even twice. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4495.9s)]
*  So who backed him? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4496.74s)]
*  You don't just get elected to statewide office anywhere [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4497.58s)]
*  by yourself. [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4499.339999999999s)]
*  Well, the DFL has all the money. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4500.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, it's like 10 to one, 100 to one. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4501.0199999999995s)]
*  It's unbelievable what they can spend. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4503.7s)]
*  But it is a lot of out of state. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4506.099999999999s)]
*  Where are they getting their money? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4507.42s)]
*  Money, yes. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4509.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4510.26s)]
*  Very little actually, locally. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4511.1s)]
*  So Minnesota, like every other place in the country, [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4516.62s)]
*  is just like totally dominated by out of state leftists, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4519.18s)]
*  billionaires who hate America, want to destroy it. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4522.22s)]
*  That's what I think is so telling. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4524.22s)]
*  Keith Ellison, not from Minnesota, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4526.62s)]
*  he's the law enforcement officer for the state. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4528.18s)]
*  Tim Walls, Fry, a lot of these people [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4532.58s)]
*  and they've done so much damage. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4536.54s)]
*  In a pretty short amount of time. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4537.98s)]
*  So they're all from out of state. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4539.7s)]
*  They're all paid by donors from out of state. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4541.179999999999s)]
*  None of this has anything to do with Minnesota. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4545.259999999999s)]
*  And they've completely taken over your state [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4547.82s)]
*  and changed it utterly, packed it with immigrants, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4549.74s)]
*  by the way, changed the nature of who lives there, [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4552.94s)]
*  the demographics of it completely. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4556.46s)]
*  And none of it was organic. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4559.379999999999s)]
*  Like it wasn't like the people of Minnesota asked for this. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4561.86s)]
*  It wasn't democracy. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4564.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's always this like Minnesota nice. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4565.7s)]
*  I'm sure you've probably heard that. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4567.54s)]
*  But it's- [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4568.94s)]
*  There's nice people live there. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4569.78s)]
*  But Minnesota naive. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4570.62s)]
*  I'm like, are we really that naive? [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4571.46s)]
*  I mean, I can, I'm not that naive, [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4572.74s)]
*  which is why I'm trying to do something about it. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4575.1s)]
*  Well passive, they're very passive. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4576.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4578.22s)]
*  And it's this land of 10,000 lakes [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4579.26s)]
*  that seems to have turned into the land of 10,000 lies. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4581.9s)]
*  So many lies, sadly. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4586.46s)]
*  Who's Keith Ellison? [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4590.54s)]
*  Well, quite a bit about him in my book as well. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4592.62s)]
*  But when we talk about even just this war on the police [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4597.62s)]
*  that has been waged in Minneapolis [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4601.0199999999995s)]
*  across the state of Minnesota, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4603.74s)]
*  he was an attorney who came to Minnesota [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4606.46s)]
*  and represented gang members decades ago. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4612.34s)]
*  In fact, represented a gang member [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4617.34s)]
*  who was responsible for executing [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4619.38s)]
*  a Minneapolis police officer, Jerry Hoff. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4622.099999999999s)]
*  He was involved in that. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4625.26s)]
*  It's hard to believe, I think, by any cops in the state. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4627.74s)]
*  However, he was elected to be our attorney general. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4631.0199999999995s)]
*  But he's very anti-law enforcement, that's clear. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4637.099999999999s)]
*  Besides the four- [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4639.82s)]
*  And what's his job now? [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4641.54s)]
*  He's the attorney general of Minnesota. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4642.54s)]
*  So he's the chief law enforcement officer in the state, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4644.38s)]
*  but he's very anti-law enforcement? [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4645.9s)]
*  Correct. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4647.26s)]
*  It's like a vegetarian butcher, it just doesn't work. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4648.900000000001s)]
*  Actually makes no sense at all. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4650.740000000001s)]
*  But in addition to these four officers, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4652.900000000001s)]
*  there was another female officer criminally charged [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4656.02s)]
*  and another Minneapolis police officer [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4660.06s)]
*  criminally charged as well. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4661.700000000001s)]
*  So this is six police officers charged. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4663.26s)]
*  They tried to charge another [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4667.700000000001s)]
*  Minnesota state trooper criminally recently, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4669.860000000001s)]
*  and the charges were dropped. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4672.700000000001s)]
*  We also lost in the line of duty [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4674.5s)]
*  five first responders. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4677.74s)]
*  One was a firefighter paramedic [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4680.34s)]
*  in a matter of 13 months in Minnesota. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4682.94s)]
*  Lost, what do you mean? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4684.98s)]
*  You have just this anti-law enforcement rhetoric [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4686.82s)]
*  murdered on the job. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4690.099999999999s)]
*  Five? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4691.74s)]
*  In a matter of a year, basically. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4692.74s)]
*  Again, something that people don't- [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4696.58s)]
*  Did anyone name a ballpark after any of them? [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4697.42s)]
*  No. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4700.0599999999995s)]
*  Right, so this is nihilists from out of state [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4701.26s)]
*  who hate the United States, hate Christianity, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4703.099999999999s)]
*  who are trying to invert our society and destroy it. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4705.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'm not saying it's the Chinese, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4709.0199999999995s)]
*  but I don't know what this is, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4710.82s)]
*  but it's not bubbling up from the people of Minnesota, is it? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4713.94s)]
*  No, in fact, I've never, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4719.0599999999995s)]
*  I struggle sometimes finding people that will say openly [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4722.139999999999s)]
*  that they even support walls. [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4724.98s)]
*  As a reporter, it's really shocking to me. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4726.62s)]
*  I was actually trying to help some news crews [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4728.94s)]
*  that were in town saying, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4730.66s)]
*  okay, well maybe go to this festival or that. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4732.0599999999995s)]
*  They were struggling to find people to go on camera [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4734.14s)]
*  that even would openly admit to supporting him. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4736.740000000001s)]
*  In fact, his home area in Mankato [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4740.34s)]
*  where he lived for 20 years, they voted for Trump. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4742.620000000001s)]
*  And Walls was on the ticket with Kamala. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4746.06s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4749.3s)]
*  Who's gonna be governor next? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4750.14s)]
*  That's a great question. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4752.3s)]
*  He's likely running again. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4755.06s)]
*  Tim Walls. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4756.820000000001s)]
*  It sounds that way, gearing up to at this point. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4757.660000000001s)]
*  Huh. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4760.62s)]
*  You think of all the money that we spend, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4761.9400000000005s)]
*  we spend trillion dollars a year on the military, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4764.18s)]
*  I'm not against the military, I guess, [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4766.54s)]
*  but I mean, maybe we could spend some of that money [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4768.46s)]
*  improving our cities or finding better leaders [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4771.58s)]
*  or something, right? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4774.14s)]
*  It's just such a tragedy. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4776.62s)]
*  So let's talk about Minneapolis, the city, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4778.18s)]
*  all eyes were on it five years ago, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4780.820000000001s)]
*  almost exactly five years ago, the summer of 2020. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4782.38s)]
*  And the idea was there are all these [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4785.46s)]
*  like systemic racism problems. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4787.46s)]
*  Nikki Haley told us there, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4789.42s)]
*  and this was gonna cleanse them through fire. [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4791.78s)]
*  What's the city like now? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4796.26s)]
*  You've been there, you said your whole life. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4798.06s)]
*  Is it better? [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4799.86s)]
*  It's unrecognizable in many areas, not better. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4801.74s)]
*  Yet to find anybody who thinks the city is better [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4805.66s)]
*  five years later. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4809.38s)]
*  It's unrecognizable in what way? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4810.7s)]
*  Businesses boarded up, people gone. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4813.9800000000005s)]
*  There was a very bustling, I worked downtown, [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4818.1s)]
*  that's where WCCO was. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4819.780000000001s)]
*  And for 14 years, no problem, walking around downtown, [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4823.18s)]
*  that was just part of life, [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4827.5s)]
*  vibrant people out having lunch. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4828.740000000001s)]
*  It's a ghost town downtown, graffiti, crime, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4831.42s)]
*  I can't even begin to tell you, even just yesterday, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4837.06s)]
*  an 11 year old boy shot in the middle of the day [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4841.02s)]
*  in a park, killed, something like that would never, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4842.9800000000005s)]
*  happen. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4848.18s)]
*  And it's daily, weekly that these horrific things happen. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4849.740000000001s)]
*  They never even tracked car jackings [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4853.620000000001s)]
*  in the city of Minneapolis before [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4856.34s)]
*  because they just maybe won a year. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4857.660000000001s)]
*  In the wake of Floyd, there was I think 700 the year after. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4860.54s)]
*  But it went from one to 700 in one year? [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4864.860000000001s)]
*  In just a year. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4867.42s)]
*  They had to, and again, they have no cops. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4868.58s)]
*  And you also have policies that have been [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4873.42s)]
*  so dramatically changed. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4875.74s)]
*  It's a use of force report basically, [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4878.86s)]
*  that they have to fill out if you handcuff a person [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4881.099999999999s)]
*  in arresting them, you have to call a supervisor [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4883.139999999999s)]
*  to get permission. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4885.179999999999s)]
*  These are things that are now put in place. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4886.94s)]
*  You have these violence interrupter groups [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4889.46s)]
*  that have taken over for the cops [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4891.66s)]
*  that are basically just seen sitting on their phones [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4895.3s)]
*  every day. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4898.3s)]
*  And that's where our tax dollars are going [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4899.5s)]
*  to pay for these groups. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4901.74s)]
*  Many of them have connections to Keith Ellison, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4903.26s)]
*  that's documented. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4906.54s)]
*  But when I say unrecognizable, [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4910.780000000001s)]
*  it's almost even hard to explain how different life is [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4912.26s)]
*  in Minneapolis now. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4915.5s)]
*  Do you go? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4917.58s)]
*  I go for work. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4919.820000000001s)]
*  But even I was shooting some interviews [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4922.46s)]
*  in Minneapolis just recently. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4925.14s)]
*  And it's not uncommon to see crime for yourself happen. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4927.5s)]
*  Just on the way, there's somebody down the street [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4932.66s)]
*  being held at gunpoint for their car. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4938.02s)]
*  I mean, I know it sounds crazy, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4939.94s)]
*  but it really is like the wild, wild west. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4941.98s)]
*  There's a naked man that one of my friends captured [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4945.14s)]
*  on his cell phone having lunch in downtown Minneapolis, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4948.98s)]
*  just a naked guy walking around on the street. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4952.66s)]
*  Drug deals happening. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4956.94s)]
*  You can see them from above [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4958.46s)]
*  in some of the high-rise buildings [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4960.42s)]
*  when people even do go. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4962.58s)]
*  But it's sad. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4965.22s)]
*  It used to be a place where you'd go see a show. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4966.06s)]
*  And certainly people are still doing that, [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4968.86s)]
*  but not anywhere close to what it was before. [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4971.18s)]
*  Five years ago. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4975.3s)]
*  This is not like in the 70s, this is five years ago. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4976.54s)]
*  Right, right. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4978.9800000000005s)]
*  So I'll just be totally blunt with you, Liz. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4981.42s)]
*  I'm overwhelmed by what you've said. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4983.7s)]
*  I'm really sad about it, even though I'm not from there. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4985.5s)]
*  Are there any signs of hope [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4988.78s)]
*  that this slide can be arrested, that things can get better? [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4990.3s)]
*  So I'm always a hopeful person. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4994.7s)]
*  And I think that's why I did jump ship [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4996.5s)]
*  and wanted to play a part in telling the truth [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=4999.7s)]
*  and join independent media. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5003.179999999999s)]
*  And I've definitely seen more people open their eyes, [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5005.9s)]
*  at least we're willing to now have these conversations. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5010.34s)]
*  But when you have a political assassination that takes place [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5013.66s)]
*  and you're just like, how is this? [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5016.7s)]
*  This isn't the state that I grew up in. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5019.46s)]
*  Again, it seems to be unrecognizable. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5023.58s)]
*  But I remain hopeful because it really is. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5026.139999999999s)]
*  It's a beautiful state, wonderful people made me who I am. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5030.0599999999995s)]
*  And I think there are more of us than we realize. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5036.22s)]
*  Sometimes you can feel a little bit out there and alone, [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5039.74s)]
*  but there are more of us than we realize. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5042.54s)]
*  Do you think there's any chance that the normal people [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5045.94s)]
*  who are actually from, unlike Jacob Fry, from Minnesota, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5049.0599999999995s)]
*  like take their state back? [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5052.259999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think that there are many people [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5055.339999999999s)]
*  who even five years ago, [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5057.7s)]
*  I mean, I'll just say doing the fall of Minneapolis, [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5059.54s)]
*  I mean, I couldn't even find a hairstylist or makeup artist [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5061.94s)]
*  because this was crazy. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5065.179999999999s)]
*  If you would be willing to tell the truth about this. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5066.46s)]
*  But you couldn't find someone to do your hair? [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5070.299999999999s)]
*  People were so afraid to attach themselves [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5072.219999999999s)]
*  and it is completely different now. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5075.900000000001s)]
*  I mean, if you see people are willing to step up [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5078.06s)]
*  and speak out now, and that wasn't the case years ago. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5082.38s)]
*  What if it happened in Black Lives Matter? [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5084.62s)]
*  Do they still exist or they just run off [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5086.06s)]
*  with all the real estate and disappear? [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5087.34s)]
*  Yeah, they came in, made a bunch of money and left town. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5088.9800000000005s)]
*  Are they working to improve the lives of black people? [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5094.46s)]
*  I haven't seen it in Minneapolis. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5097.58s)]
*  Well, they were the most famous group [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5100.06s)]
*  in the world there for a while. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5101.14s)]
*  Well, we had like bow down before them [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5103.7s)]
*  and wash their feet and stuff, but they just, they're gone? [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5105.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I've always said that that's the story, right? [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5109.26s)]
*  Black lives, sadly, in Minneapolis [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5112.38s)]
*  have never mattered less. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5115.3s)]
*  I mean, this is, they've become, [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5116.42s)]
*  and many of them have reached out, [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5121.0199999999995s)]
*  I've done many stories, their lives, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5122.82s)]
*  they want police back, they want protection [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5125.099999999999s)]
*  and they just, they don't have it anymore. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5128.3s)]
*  Yeah, and also it's like, it's not even about black or white [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5131.42s)]
*  or it's about America and you don't have a right [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5133.9800000000005s)]
*  to shoot people, you can't do that. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5136.66s)]
*  Whether you want, your neighborhood wants police presence [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5138.54s)]
*  or not, it's kind of not up to you. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5142.1s)]
*  We don't put up with murder here [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5143.26s)]
*  because we're a civilized country, that's my view. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5144.42s)]
*  Last question, if people are interested [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5147.5s)]
*  in following your reporting, where do they find it? [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5149.42s)]
*  So thefallofminneapolis.com is where you can go, [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5151.86s)]
*  more information about the book and the documentary is free, [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5154.62s)]
*  you can see it right there. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5156.66s)]
*  And also we've done many follow-up stories [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5157.66s)]
*  that make sense on everything that's taken place [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5159.5s)]
*  in Minneapolis, you'll find it on that website. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5161.58s)]
*  Liz Collin on X is where you can find my reporting [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5163.38s)]
*  in alphanews.org, a team of independent reporters [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5166.66s)]
*  in Minnesota working to uncover all of this. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5170.34s)]
*  Bless you for doing it, I'm sure it's thankless [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5173.34s)]
*  a lot of the time, but I think it's important [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5175.62s)]
*  to tell the truth, whether it's acknowledged as true [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5178.06s)]
*  at the time you were creating a documentary record [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5180.5s)]
*  that at the very least historians can assess [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5182.94s)]
*  to find out what really happened. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5185.66s)]
*  And I just think objectively that matters, [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5187.62s)]
*  like you want the truth out there, it's a good thing, [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5190.06s)]
*  always. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5191.18s)]
*  Thank you, Tucker. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5192.02s)]
*  Thank you, Liz Collin, I appreciate it. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5192.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5195.34s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5199.9400000000005s)]
*  on one level that's not surprising, that's what they do, [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5203.26s)]
*  but on another level, it's shocking. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5205.56s)]
*  With everything that's going on in the world right now, [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MGEFxNPs_Y&t=5207.3s)]
