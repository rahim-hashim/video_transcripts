# Sam Bankman-Fried on Life in Prison With Diddy, and How Democrats Stole His Money and Betrayed Him
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8)
*  So where are you? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm well, I'm in MDC, Brooklyn, in a little side room. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2.4s)]
*  What's it? How long have you been there? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=9.28s)]
*  I've been in prison for about, oh boy, what's it been now? It's been about two years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=11.92s)]
*  So what's it like? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=19.76s)]
*  It's, I mean, it's sort of dystopian. You know, the fortunate thing, the place I'm in, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=22.48s)]
*  I'm not in sort of, I'm not in physical danger. And, you know, frankly, a lot of the staff, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=28.08s)]
*  they're trying to be helpful. They're trying to, you know, do what they can, given the constraints. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=35.28s)]
*  But, you know, no one wants to be in prison. And you can imagine what happens when you take sort of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=41.12s)]
*  40 people, you know, all of whom have been at least charged with crimes and lock them in a single room [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=47.28s)]
*  for years on end and throw out the key, which is the most trivial things become [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=54.16s)]
*  all that people have left to care about. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=61.919999999999995s)]
*  Yes. Have you had any problems? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=65.6s)]
*  Not of the sort of acute kind. Like I haven't had, you know, I haven't been attacked or anything [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=70.64s)]
*  like that. I've had a lot of logistical problems. And, you know, the biggest frankly was when I was [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  on trial, trying to get access to legal work was nearly impossible. I would, you know, on a typical [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=82.4s)]
*  trial day, they'd wake me up at 4 a.m. I'd spend five hours in various buses, vans, and holding cells [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  until my trial started in the morning. Then trial straight through to 5 p.m., another four hours in [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=100.48s)]
*  holding cells in vans, you know, and get back at 9 p.m., way after any access, the legal work was [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=105.84s)]
*  cut off for the day. So that was the biggest problem. So what do you do all day when you're [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  not on trial? Well, it's a really good question because there's not a whole lot to do in prison. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=119.68s)]
*  I read books, I've, you know, started reading novels again, I play some chess, and I work on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=126.0s)]
*  my legal case to the extent I can. You know, there's appeal, there are other things. I do [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=133.04s)]
*  what work I can from in here on that, but the lack of other meaningful things to spend my time on is [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  one of the most kind of soul-crushing things about prison. I gotta say, we've never talked before, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=144.56s)]
*  but obviously I've watched you from afar. And I just also say I feel sorry for every man in prison, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=150.16s)]
*  no matter what he's accused of or did. I just, I don't think we should be locking people away. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  I know, I guess we have to, but I feel sorry for everyone in prison, I'll just say. Call me liberal. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=160.64000000000001s)]
*  But you do seem kind of healthier and less jumpy, I have to say, after two years in prison. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=165.6s)]
*  You know, I've had a lot of time to reflect on how to communicate. And in retrospect, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=173.68s)]
*  you know, I was, I think I was not effective at communicating, especially when the crisis first [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=182.32s)]
*  hit. And, you know, in the months thereafter, I made a mistake I often make. I get swept up in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=188.48s)]
*  details and I forget to make the bigger picture. You seem like you were just flying high on Adderall [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=196.16s)]
*  every time I saw you on TV. You don't seem that way now, were you? No, I wasn't, but I was, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=206.16s)]
*  um, my mind was racing because there were, you know, a billion things to keep track of. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, we sort of typically I'd have, and back when I was writing FTX, you know, I'd go on to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=219.6s)]
*  have an interview, but, you know, while on the interview, there would be two issues I'd have to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=224.0s)]
*  resolve with the company. So it'd have sort of one eye on Slack open responding to messages. And I [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=228.0s)]
*  knew that I had something else I had to do right after the interview that I hadn't had time to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  prepare for yet that I was sort of preparing for in the back of my mind. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=238.56s)]
*  So maybe like the digital world is bad for us. Is that, I mean, like what's your view of that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  You've been taken away from your phone. So that's kind of big. Yeah, oh, it is. Um, I, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=249.84s)]
*  I prefer having the digital world. Um, that, you know, at the end of the day, like it's, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=256.96s)]
*  but, but I will say that when I say that it's less from a perspective of like enjoyment or, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=262.48s)]
*  or, you know, pleasure or leisure. And it's more from a perspective of productivity and ability to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=267.68s)]
*  have impact in the world. Um, you know, from that perspective, it's so hard to do anything, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=273.12s)]
*  we don't have the digital world. So like, have you made friends there? How do you, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=278.88s)]
*  are you hanging with Diddy? I think he's in there with you. He is, he is. Um, and I, it's, I don't [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=285.52s)]
*  know if he's been kind. Um, the, I've made some friends, it's, it's a weird environment, you know, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=291.84s)]
*  it's sort of a combination of a few other high profile cases and a lot of, you know, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=299.11999999999995s)]
*  ex gangsters or sort of, you know, alleged ex gangsters. Definitely alleged. So what's Diddy like? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=306.64s)]
*  I, you know, obviously I've, I've only seen one, one piece of him, um, which is, you know, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  Diddy in prison and, you know, he's been kind to people in the unit. Um, he's been kind to me. Um, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=323.28s)]
*  it's also, it's, it's a position no one wants to be in, you know, obviously he doesn't, I don't, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=330.88s)]
*  as you said, it's, it's kind of a soul crushing place for the world in general. Um, and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=335.28s)]
*  you know, what we see are just the people that, that are around us on the inside rather than. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=344.88s)]
*  Yeah. We are on the outside. Oh, I'm, I'm sure. And I mean, you're two of the most famous prisoners [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=350.64s)]
*  in the world in the same unit. What are, what are the other, what are you like, what do the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=357.12s)]
*  armed robbers think? Well, it's a really interesting question. And if, of course, some of them are, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=360.4s)]
*  I think you're thinking like, wow, this is sort of a big opportunity, like, you know, to meet people [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=367.91999999999996s)]
*  they wouldn't otherwise get to meet, which is, it shocked me the first time I heard that. Right. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=374.23999999999995s)]
*  It makes sense from their perspective, but like, boys, I don't know how, not how I think about [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=380.0s)]
*  prison. Sorry. Sorry to laugh. No, that's it. I bet it's not how you think about it. No, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  it's not. And laughing is all you can do sometimes, you know, there's, there's no better [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  alternative. They're good at chess. That's one thing I learned. Like, you know, former armed [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=394.48s)]
*  robbers who don't speak English and, you know, probably didn't graduate middle school are, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=399.92s)]
*  a surprising number of them are like fairly good at chess. Like, you know, not, I'm not saying [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=408.72s)]
*  they're grandmasters, but like, you know, I lose games to them all the time. I was not expecting [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=413.52000000000004s)]
*  that. Wow. So how is it, that's so interesting. How has that changed your, your views? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=418.88s)]
*  Well, you know, I would say it's part of a larger whole, which, you know, it's one of the most sort [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=428.0s)]
*  of profound things that I've come to learn over my life, but still something I don't fully understand, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=434.32s)]
*  which is obviously, you know, what we call intelligence or IQ or whatever. It matters. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=439.52s)]
*  It's important. Working hard matters. It's important. But there are other things, things [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=445.12s)]
*  that we don't have good words for. I still haven't found the right words for, but things that can [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=451.28000000000003s)]
*  make someone an unbelievably impressive and successful and productive person that seem to [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=456.72s)]
*  kind of outshine what I or others would expect of them. And obviously not everyone, you know, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=464.08s)]
*  everyone's in different places, but. You know, something that's a lot of FTS, we find someone [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=470.72s)]
*  with an absolutely shit resume. I mean, just nothing to recommend themselves, no real relevant [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  experience. And all of a sudden we realized they were outperforming almost everyone else at the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  company. Just because they had the grit, they had the instincts, you know, they had the dedication, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  they knew how to work, how to interface with others and how to see solutions to problems. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=494.72s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I've known on the flip side, a number of extremely stupid people have gotten [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  rich in finance. They're clearly have a kind of brilliance that I can't see. They seem like [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=507.04s)]
*  morons to me. I'm interested in what types there are. I was on Wall Street in a former life and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=511.6s)]
*  there are a variety of people there. So there's been a lot of talk about changes to the US tax [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=519.04s)]
*  code, especially changes that affect cryptocurrency investing. What are those changes? Well, what if [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=522.96s)]
*  there was already a way to invest in the market with tax advantages? Well, I Trust Capital makes [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=528.48s)]
*  that possible. I Trust Capital is a software platform that lets you invest in crypto using [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=534.4000000000001s)]
*  a self-directed IRA. That means with a traditional IRA, taxes are deferred and with a Roth IRA, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=539.36s)]
*  you won't have to pay taxes on your crypto gains, just like a retirement account. On top of that, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=546.08s)]
*  the crypto market never closes. You can buy or sell 24-7 in case you stay up late. I Trust Capital [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=550.32s)]
*  makes investing easy, safe and accessible. You don't have to be an expert. Their website has easy [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=555.6800000000001s)]
*  to understand articles, videos, and if you ever need help, you can speak with an actual person [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=560.08s)]
*  in the United States because the whole thing is based in the United States, the whole company. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  So if you're looking to add crypto to your retirement portfolio, sign up today at [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=569.2s)]
*  itrustcapital.com slash Tucker and use a promo code Tucker for a hundred dollar funding bonus. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  So, I mean, big picture without getting into like all the details of your case, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=578.0s)]
*  but it does seem like you guys made a decision at your company to form political alliances through [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=584.32s)]
*  political donations, which is not singling you out. You're hardly the only businessman who's done [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=590.24s)]
*  that. It's actually kind of par now. But you gave so much to Democrats that I kind of thought they [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=595.36s)]
*  would rescue you in the end. Where were all your friends in the Democratic party? They usually [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=601.28s)]
*  keep their friends from going to jail. Tony Podesta never went to jail. Why did you? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=605.36s)]
*  Oh, it's a really good question. Obviously I can only guess what the answer to that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=609.52s)]
*  I can only speculate because I'm not in their minds. But, you know, one fact that might be [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=613.92s)]
*  relevant is, you know, in 2020 I was a center left and I gave to Biden's campaign. I was optimistic [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=620.48s)]
*  he'd be a sort of solid center left president. I spent the next few years in D.C. a lot. I made [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  dozens of trips there and was really, really shocked by what I saw. Not in a good direction [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=638.08s)]
*  from the administration. By late 2022, I was giving to Republicans privately as much as [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  Democrats. And that started becoming known right around FTX's collapse. So I probably played a role. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=650.8s)]
*  Why were you shocked? I know you spent a lot of time in D.C. There are pictures of you with, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=663.52s)]
*  you know, everyone. You met everybody. What was shocking about it? [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  Some of it was just more stream versions of what I worried about. Crypto regulation is a good [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=671.4399999999999s)]
*  example. I never thought that, frankly, the Democrats in general would be the party taking [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=677.52s)]
*  the lead on good financial regulation. But there were good and bad people in each party and a lot [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=683.92s)]
*  of thoughtful players. But Gensler's SEC was something out of a nightmare. A company would go [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=689.68s)]
*  offer something in the United States. Gensler would sue them to the ground for not registering. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=699.36s)]
*  So Gensler would say, hey, we'd love to register. The office says what you want. What do you want? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=703.44s)]
*  We'd register as. And the SEC would say, well, there's nothing for you to register as. We don't [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=708.8800000000001s)]
*  have any ideas. And there's just no solution. They required licenses that they didn't know how to give. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  And every company in crypto ran into this. They basically failed to register a single person effort. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=719.84s)]
*  That was one pretty disturbing thing that I saw. And go for it. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=725.36s)]
*  So can I just ask you to explain a little bit there? It's obvious to non-experts like me that [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=734.88s)]
*  Gary Gensler is obviously corrupt. I mean, that was clear. But his motives were less clear. What [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=739.84s)]
*  was that? What was his goal? It's a really good question. And again, I'm not in his brain, but [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=745.76s)]
*  some impressions I had. He really liked being in the center of things. Power. Everyone likes that. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=754.88s)]
*  Most people, he's no exception. Part of this is a turf war. He wanted his agency to get more power, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=765.9200000000001s)]
*  even if he didn't want to do anything with it except block industries. Why did he make [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=772.72s)]
*  everyone register with him while he loses power otherwise, even if he didn't know what to do with [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=780.08s)]
*  them? There are lots of stories about him being very politically ambitious and feeling like if he [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=784.64s)]
*  could get on CNBC enough, make a big enough stink about things, raise his profile that maybe he'd [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=792.64s)]
*  be Treasury Secretary, something like that in the future. And he was remarkably successful. He [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=799.5200000000001s)]
*  became sort of one of the few faces of democratic financial regulation. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=805.44s)]
*  Interesting. That sounds right to me. I mean, those sound like Washington type goals. I've [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=815.2800000000001s)]
*  seen those before. It wasn't moral. It's not like he had deeply rooted communist beliefs or anything [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=820.32s)]
*  like that. Right. No, no, I knew that. Right. No, no, it's not like or any beliefs, self-advancement. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=827.36s)]
*  Okay. So, when things started to go south and you were criminally charged or thought you might be [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=834.32s)]
*  criminally charged, you've given so much money to the Democratic Party that I think it's pretty, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=840.4s)]
*  leaving aside moral judgment here, but it's pretty normal in business for the donor to call the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=845.2s)]
*  person he's donating to and saying, hey, I'm in trouble. Can you help me? Did you call [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=849.44s)]
*  Schumer or any of the people you had supported and say, hey, I need your help? It's the Biden [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=854.64s)]
*  Justice Department. Help me. I didn't for multiple reasons. One was, you know, I didn't want to do [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=859.12s)]
*  something inappropriate. A second was that many parts of it very quickly made their positions [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=867.04s)]
*  known and were running away as quickly as they could. You know, I had these good relationships, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=876.72s)]
*  probably better with Republicans in D.C. as with Democrats by that point in time, although that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=885.68s)]
*  wasn't public thought. It would have been easy to see that from the outside. And at the end of the [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=890.16s)]
*  day, there's a long story here involves a law firm that took a pretty unusual and active role [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=898.16s)]
*  in the case. But before I even gave up control of FTX, before it was ever filed for bankruptcy, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=904.4s)]
*  the DOJ had already made up its mind. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=911.76s)]
*  And so there was you didn't call in any favors or try to? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=916.6400000000001s)]
*  Interesting. What do you think of the future of crypto? I mean, obviously, you must have [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  complicated feelings since you ran a crypto company or in jail because of it, but you know [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=931.2800000000001s)]
*  a lot about the topic. You sort of feel like things are moving very fast on crypto. Do you [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=935.92s)]
*  think they're moving in a good direction? I know it's sort of weird to ask you this question, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=943.76s)]
*  but I can't resist. No, hopefully is what I would say. You know, you look at what the Trump [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=946.64s)]
*  administration said, you know, going into office, there are a lot of good things. There are a lot of [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=954.8s)]
*  things that, you know, were very different from the sense that the Biden administration took that [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=959.68s)]
*  Gensler and the SEC took. Obviously, the follow through is what matters. And that's the stage [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=965.1199999999999s)]
*  that we're at now, which is what will come of this. And I mean, not surprisingly, like changing the [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=970.88s)]
*  guard helps, but financial regulators, they're big giant bureaucracies in the federal government. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  They're not used to changing overnight. And they have been playing a really obstructive role [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=987.68s)]
*  for, you know, a decade in crypto. You know, the US, it's 30% of the world's finance. It's about [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=995.12s)]
*  5% of the world's crypto. And the reason it's entirely regulatory, it's just the US was unique [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1002.56s)]
*  in its difficulty to work with. So I think the big question is, will, you know, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1009.04s)]
*  when rubber meets the road, like will the administration do what needs to be done and [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1016.4000000000001s)]
*  figure out how to do it? I mean, I remember when the concept of crypto first arrived in the popular [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1021.2800000000001s)]
*  press, and the whole idea was that this was a currency that could restore to the individual [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1030.16s)]
*  his freedom of commerce, I get to buy and sell things without the government controlling me, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1036.8s)]
*  and I could do it privately, it would restore my privacy as well. And that obviously has never [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1042.08s)]
*  happened. It doesn't seem like it's ever going to happen. And I don't hear anybody say it anymore. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1047.76s)]
*  And now it just seems like it's kind of another asset scam. Whatever happened to, I mean, these [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1052.0s)]
*  are broad brush statements, but whatever happened to the privacy thing? It's a really good question. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  And there's sort of a lady thing about the technology, right? Payments, remittances, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1063.04s)]
*  like all the things that are not just an investment, but ways that crypto could actually [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1068.0s)]
*  be useful for the world. You know, they happen on longer timescales than investments do, basically. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1073.2s)]
*  You know, with what social media has become, you see bubbles, you know, grow and pop and grow and [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1079.68s)]
*  pop on a daily to monthly basis. Technology is built out on a decade basis. So, you know, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1085.36s)]
*  you know, right now, crypto is not quite at a point where it could become an everyday tool of, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1092.8s)]
*  you know, a quarter of the world or something. The tech isn't there yet, but it's not that far [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1100.3999999999999s)]
*  away. And if, and this is an if, if the industry keeps making progress rather than getting [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1105.68s)]
*  distracted too much by market prices, then, you know, five, 10 years from now, you could imagine [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1111.52s)]
*  a world where all of a sudden it is the case that anyone can have a crypto wallet, you know, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1118.0s)]
*  billion people could use it each day with privacy, with security, fast, cheap, international, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1123.76s)]
*  all the things that, you know, that was promised and that absolutely get, are distracted from by [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1132.4s)]
*  the latest mean points. You think world governments would allow that? I mean, if you actually allowed [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1139.28s)]
*  the world's population to conduct financial transactions without the control of governments, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  then governments would collapse instantly, wouldn't they? [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1154.0s)]
*  Well, it's an interesting question. And there are a lot of degrees here about the level of [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1157.44s)]
*  overseeing control that you will get something like Bitcoin and the wallets are anonymous, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1162.96s)]
*  but there is a public ledger of every transfer that happens. So it is possible for governments [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1168.48s)]
*  to have some level of knowledge without having control of it. That being said, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1174.4s)]
*  not all the governments in the world view this the same. And the United States government over [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1182.88s)]
*  the last 30 years has taken one view towards control of, you know, the, not just the United [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1186.72s)]
*  States, frankly, but the world's monetary dealings. And you see, I mean, a different viewpoint, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1194.72s)]
*  much more authoritarian, but also much more insular in a lot of sort of dictatorships. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1204.08s)]
*  But half the world doesn't try to have nearly the level of government involvement in [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1209.36s)]
*  day-to-day financial transactions that the United States has. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1217.36s)]
*  So the people who built this country built it because they wanted freedom. One word, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1220.56s)]
*  freedom. They wanted freedom from oppressors who forced them to buy overpriced tea, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1223.36s)]
*  then blockaded them when they tried to dump it into the ocean. How'd that work out? Well, [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1227.84s)]
*  we built America in response. So it's time to throw your big overpriced wireless contract [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1231.2s)]
*  overboard to a new tea party. You don't have to pay a hundred dollars a month just to use a phone. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1236.96s)]
*  Most people don't use that much in services, but they pay it anyway. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1242.16s)]
*  Our cell phone company, PureTalk, says no to those prices. With a qualifying plan, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1246.48s)]
*  you can choose an iPhone 14 or a Samsung Galaxy for nothing, zero. Get premium service on America's [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1251.04s)]
*  most dependable 5G network. It only takes a minute to switch. We highly recommend it. No hassle, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1257.84s)]
*  no gimmicks. Just honest to goodness wireless priced right. So you get your iPhone 14 or Samsung [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1262.56s)]
*  Galaxy for nothing, zero dollars with a qualifying plan. Go to puretalk.com slash Tucker. Visit [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  puretalk.com slash Tucker for details. America's wireless company. Do you have any money left [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1273.9199999999998s)]
*  after all this? Well, basically no. The company that I used to own, [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1280.64s)]
*  maybe I still do own, I don't know, it's in bankruptcy, had nothing intervened. Today, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1291.0400000000002s)]
*  it would have about $15 billion of liabilities and about $93 billion of assets. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1301.2s)]
*  So the answer should be in theory, yes, that there was enough money to pay everyone back in kind [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1311.0400000000002s)]
*  at the time or today with plenty of interest left over and tens of billions left for investors. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1321.92s)]
*  But that's not how things worked out. And instead it all got rolled up in a bankruptcy where [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1330.0s)]
*  the assets were dissipated incredibly quickly by those controlling it. They're siphoned off [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1346.72s)]
*  tens of billions of dollars worth. And it's been a colossal disaster. And I mean, [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1354.56s)]
*  not solving that from happening is by far the biggest regret of my life. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1364.3999999999999s)]
*  So you knew everybody else in the crypto business. You're one of the most famous people in the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1368.32s)]
*  business before the charges, before all of this happened. Being as honest as you can, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1372.6399999999999s)]
*  do you think you were the biggest criminal in the crypto business? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1378.8s)]
*  I don't think I was a criminal. So certainly the answer to that is no. I mean, I think the DOJ [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1381.6s)]
*  thinks that I may have been, but I don't care. Well, yeah, you're in jail. That's their claim [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1388.1599999999999s)]
*  anyway. But I wonder, and I'm not, you know, I've certainly criticized your business and other [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1394.08s)]
*  businesses like in the past. And again, I'm not even getting into the details of your case, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1400.24s)]
*  because it's like Byzantine. But I'm just wondering, like, do you think there's a lot [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1404.8s)]
*  of shady behavior in the crypto business? Being honest. Yeah. Ten years ago, the answer was [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1411.6000000000001s)]
*  clearly yes, or at least yes, relative to the scale of the industry. You know, you look in the [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1419.1200000000001s)]
*  2014 to 2017 sort of era, and there is not, you know, the industry is a lot smaller than it was [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1425.76s)]
*  today. And a lot of the transactions I can sell, or at least a higher fraction of them, were, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1432.24s)]
*  well, different people use different words for it, but it's still fraud. You know, as an example, [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1439.68s)]
*  right, people purchasing narcotics online was a common use of crypto back 10 years ago or so. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1446.72s)]
*  Obviously, there are always going to be criminals in any industry, but over time, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1456.48s)]
*  the fraction of the industry that that represents has fallen off really substantially, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1460.8s)]
*  both because of sort of growth of other areas of interest in crypto, and also because of more [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1466.08s)]
*  government involvement on the anti-money laundering side. So yeah, there's still some, but not, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1471.36s)]
*  it's not as as prevalent as it once was. So you were famously identified with a worldview [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1479.04s)]
*  and ideology, maybe even a religion called effective altruism, and the idea was that, [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1487.84s)]
*  as I understand it, that you, you know, do the greatest good for the greatest number, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1492.08s)]
*  you make money in order to help the maximum number of people. And some have pointed out the irony [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1496.08s)]
*  that in the collapse of your company, like a million people lost their money. So there were [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1501.6s)]
*  a lot of individuals hurt in an effort that you described as like the greatest good for the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1506.0s)]
*  greatest number. And I wonder if all of this has made you rethink the precepts of effective altruism. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1511.6799999999998s)]
*  It hasn't made me rethink the precepts. Obviously, I feel terrible about what happened. It's not at [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1518.24s)]
*  all what I intended. And whatever one's intentions are, I, you know, if you screw up, then the results [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1524.48s)]
*  might be different. You know, people have their money back at the end, but it is too excruciating [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1532.72s)]
*  years waiting for it. They got it back, dollarized rather than in kind. And I, and certainly all the [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1538.72s)]
*  good that I've been hoping to do for the world ended up dissipating, or at least most of it did, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1547.84s)]
*  when the company collapsed. I guess what I'm saying is do, I mean, I think it's hard for most [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1552.56s)]
*  people to understand the idea that it's more virtuous or valuable to help people they've [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1562.08s)]
*  never met than it is to help the people right in front of them. In other words, like it's [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1568.48s)]
*  way more virtuous to help your wife, girlfriend, mother, daughter, brother, college roommate, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1573.84s)]
*  than it is to help like a village in a country you've never visited. I think that's how most [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1580.56s)]
*  people feel intuitively. But you disagree. I disagree, although there's a caveat to it, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1584.8799999999999s)]
*  which is that, you know, a classic mistake which people make, and I may have made at some points, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1591.1999999999998s)]
*  is with people who you don't know, who are distant from you, thinking you know what they need, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1597.6s)]
*  when you don't. You know, being paternalistic, kind of condescending, and you know, there's so [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1603.68s)]
*  many foreign aid type projects that have gone awry and ended up being complete wastes of money, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1608.72s)]
*  because no one knew the people they were giving to, no one knew what their lives were like. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1614.24s)]
*  And they're just guessing at what those people needed, and it's just wrong. And you know, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1618.88s)]
*  they show up with like a bunch of water pumps to a village that has plenty of water and no food. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1622.64s)]
*  And like, you know, these people shipped in from Harvard to go hand out these water pumps no one [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1627.68s)]
*  wants. And you know, there's like example after example of this going awry. Whereas obviously, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1632.32s)]
*  like when you're dealing with people you know, you know, you have much better sense of how to [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1638.24s)]
*  help them. And that's real. Like that effect is absolutely real. And you know, even if I think [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1643.12s)]
*  the life matters as much in one place as another, that doesn't mean that you know as well how to [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1647.84s)]
*  help one as you do the other. Well, see, I think you're sort of making a counter case, you're [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1653.36s)]
*  arguing against your own position. I mean, isn't it? I mean, I guess the problem I have with the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1659.28s)]
*  effect of altruism is just too easy. I mean, it's like, it's easy to cure polio, it's really hard [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  to make the same woman happy for 30 years. And so maybe it's better to do the hard thing. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1668.16s)]
*  Well, I think what I'd say is, look, you look at I mean, malaria is a good example here, right? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1673.92s)]
*  No one dies of malaria anymore in the United States. And basically, no one does. But globally, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1679.84s)]
*  it's what like a million people a year or something die of it. And that's horrible. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1684.08s)]
*  That it's like, this is just a disease people shouldn't be dying from anymore. We know how to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1689.1999999999998s)]
*  basically eradicate it. And we should absolutely be doing that as a world. But you know, because [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1693.76s)]
*  it's sort of like easy in some sense, that shouldn't stop us from being able to help people, [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1698.56s)]
*  you know, at home, you look at like, the scale of resources that would be required to many of these, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1705.36s)]
*  you know, interventions in the poorest part of the world, and it's not that big. It's not making, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1711.84s)]
*  it would not take a big bite out of our domestic health, if it were done efficiently. But the [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1716.48s)]
*  efficient part is a big piece of this, you can throw as many useless water pumps at villages [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1722.8s)]
*  without food as you want, without curing anyone. No, I think I mean, you make it, I mean, that's [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1727.52s)]
*  demonstrably true. And 60 years of aid to Africa has shown that as life expectancy has declined. But [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  I guess as a moral matter, how can you justify worrying about malaria when your cousin is addicted [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1737.68s)]
*  to Xanax? Shouldn't you fix that first? If I could, but you know, at the end of the day, [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1747.04s)]
*  we have responsibilities to each of us. And you know, if I know my cousin well, and I know [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1754.5600000000002s)]
*  how to solve his problem because I'm his cousin, then absolutely, like I have a responsibility [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1759.52s)]
*  to do that. But if I've tried and I'm flailing at that, I can't figure out how to make progress, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1764.0s)]
*  but I can figure out how to save lives internationally, or if someone can, then I [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1770.16s)]
*  don't think it takes away from the good that they can do internationally that they couldn't figure out [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1775.84s)]
*  how to solve their cousin's problem. Right. So do it again. I don't think that's a crazy point. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1780.0s)]
*  Last question on this topic. Can you think of a big recent international aid project that was an [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1785.52s)]
*  unequivocal success? So sort of, but I'm not going to name it. It's not going to be a government [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1791.6s)]
*  aid project, to be clear. They're private projects that happen. Right. You know, actually, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1800.0s)]
*  malaria is a good example where a substantial fraction of the world's malaria has been cut down [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1806.56s)]
*  already by mostly private contributions from people to South Saharan Africa and India, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1811.04s)]
*  that, you know, saving probably hundreds of thousands of lives a year right now for, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1817.68s)]
*  you know, thousands of dollars per life on average, which is, you know, sort of a stunning [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1822.48s)]
*  success on a relative scale. Now, we're not talking about a trillion dollars. We're talking [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1830.16s)]
*  about single digit billions of dollars directed by really careful work by philanthropists. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1834.8s)]
*  And, you know, of course you can look at gigantic government programs that did absolutely nothing. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1841.5200000000002s)]
*  If you want the government approach, I mean, I don't know the Marshall Plan, like, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1848.64s)]
*  it's sort of digging pretty deep in history, but rebuilding Germany after World War II was [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1853.5200000000002s)]
*  probably a huge success on many fronts. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1861.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think we've undone it by blowing up Nord Stream, but, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1864.56s)]
*  but yeah, no, I think it's a fair point. So how old are you now? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1870.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, the funny thing, it took me a second to think of the answer that prison, [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1879.04s)]
*  time changes when you're in prison. It becomes sort of an amorphous concept when every day is [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1885.9199999999998s)]
*  the last and they just blur together. The answer is, well, I guess my birthday's tomorrow. So [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1895.2800000000002s)]
*  as of right now, I am 32, but I will be 33 soon. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1902.3200000000002s)]
*  How are you going to celebrate your birthday? [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1911.2s)]
*  I'm not. I was never big on birthdays on the outside and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1913.52s)]
*  celebrating another year in prison just doesn't feel like all that exciting to me. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1918.24s)]
*  So you're not going to tell Diddy it's your birthday tomorrow? I don't believe you. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1923.52s)]
*  Someone else might tell him, but I don't plan to. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1928.08s)]
*  So, okay, so you'll be 33 tomorrow. If you are not pardoned, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1931.36s)]
*  all things being equal, how old will you be when you get out? [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1936.08s)]
*  It's a complicated calculation, which I don't understand all the details of because of like [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1940.56s)]
*  first step app stuff. And if you just add, you know, my prison sentence, my age, so to speak, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1945.12s)]
*  you know, then the answer is in my late 40s. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1950.4s)]
*  Wow. Could you handle that? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1956.4s)]
*  Sorry, what I said was wrong. I misspoke. If you add my prison sentence, my age, the late 50s, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1961.3600000000001s)]
*  if you include all of the possible decreases, it might be the late 40s. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1966.64s)]
*  But the raw answer is, I mean, it's 32 when I was convicted and I got a 25 year sentence. So that's [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1971.1200000000001s)]
*  57. So having done two out of the 25 so far, do you think you could, could you make it? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1977.36s)]
*  It's a good question. I'm not sure. I mean, the hardest thing is just not having something [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1988.8s)]
*  meaningful to be doing in here. And, you know, and you can look at their studies, I have no idea how [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=1994.6399999999999s)]
*  good they are, but they show, you know, you age at roughly three times the normal rate in prison. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2001.36s)]
*  So, you know, you had three times 25 to my 32 years when I was convicted. And, [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2007.36s)]
*  you know, that gets you an answer of maybe. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2016.9599999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, it strikes me there's a kind of weird, it's, I mean, you went maybe more than anyone [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2020.56s)]
*  I've ever talked to from one world to a completely different world. So you were in the world of [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2025.84s)]
*  digital money. Now you're in a world with no money. What's the medium of exchange in prison? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2030.24s)]
*  I, you know, it's whatever people have and, you know, muffins, like these little, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2036.0s)]
*  so like little plastic wrapped, you like, you go to like a, like a gas station and like on the [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2041.84s)]
*  counter, there might be like a plastic bowl with little individually wrapped plastic muffins that [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2047.76s)]
*  have been sitting there for a week at room temperature. You know, imagine one of those [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2052.4s)]
*  that sort of that, that's like standard. It's that a packet of ramen soup or a kind of disgusting [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2056.64s)]
*  looking little foil package of fish in oil at room temperature. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2062.16s)]
*  Ooh. Yeah. So you went, you went from crypto to the muffin economy. Yeah, that's right. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2068.16s)]
*  How would you compare them? Obviously it's harder to move muffins internationally, but. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2075.12s)]
*  Right. I don't think they're going to be. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2080.16s)]
*  As a currency. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2081.2799999999997s)]
*  Anytime soon, globally. I don't think it's going to be a strategic must-find reserve. So, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2082.48s)]
*  you know, they're in a, they're a currency of need. They wouldn't be anything else. They don't have [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2088.72s)]
*  that much to recommend themselves, but at the end of the day, they're kind of fungible. They're not [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2095.04s)]
*  exactly fungible, but they're close enough. You know, two muffins are kind of similar, so you can [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2100.24s)]
*  kind of trade them for each other. They kind of work as long as you're never dealing with more [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2103.3599999999997s)]
*  than like $5. Right. Because if you wanted to do a $200 transaction in muffins, like, you know, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2108.56s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't work physically. Right. And it's unwieldy. Yeah. It's unwieldy. And so one of the [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2116.4s)]
*  things that like you realize really quickly is, I mean, the scale of everything is so diminished [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2121.7599999999998s)]
*  in prison. You know, you see people getting into a fist fight over a single banana. Not because [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2129.92s)]
*  they even care about it that much, but because what else is there to channel your caring into? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2136.0s)]
*  Oh, that's grim. Have you, do you eat the muffins by the way? I don't eat them. No, I just [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2142.88s)]
*  poured them in. Yeah. I don't actually eat them. I mostly rice and beans and ramen. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  Wow. Well, it looks like it's been good for you. Have you gotten any tattoos? [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2158.7200000000003s)]
*  I have not. I know some people who have, but I have not gotten any prison tattoos. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2163.52s)]
*  Have you thought about it? No. You know, there's a part of me that's always like, [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2168.56s)]
*  thought about getting a tattoo, but talking with the inmates about their, you know, sanitization [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2173.28s)]
*  procedures or lack thereof for the needles sort of, you know, that, that cured that idea in my mind. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2180.8s)]
*  No interest anymore. It's not worth the Hep C. It's not worth the Hep C. It's, you know, I would [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2187.76s)]
*  say like maybe they go through like four people or so before bothering to sanitize a needle. Oh. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2193.44s)]
*  Yeah. Oh, okay. So you're not, you're not doing that. So since, since you've been away and you're [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2200.0s)]
*  facing, I guess, 23 more years, I always wonder like the people you helped, I mean, you're in [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2206.48s)]
*  prison because you hurt people, but you also helped a lot of people in Washington by giving [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2213.84s)]
*  them many, many millions of dollars. Did any of them call you to say, you know, good luck, I hope [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2219.36s)]
*  you're doing okay. Don't join a gang or say anything to you at all. Right. When the collapse [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2224.24s)]
*  hit, like in the immediate wake of it, I got a number of really nice messages from a lot of [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2230.3199999999997s)]
*  people, including some in DC by six months later, none. And so by the time trial happened, whereas, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2234.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, put in prison, nothing. And it's, it became too politically toxic. It became the [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2241.8399999999997s)]
*  incentives were too skewed against people, you know, risking their necks. I even heard frankly, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2250.32s)]
*  about people saying third hand, like nice things about me, but no one wanted to be in contact with [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2256.8s)]
*  me directly. Did anyone contact you? I mean, I, I noticed that your, I thought was your girlfriend [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2265.36s)]
*  testified against you. Like, you know, there, did you have any friends who stayed loyal and [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2273.76s)]
*  supported you or, and continue to? Barely. Yes, but very, very few. I was [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2279.6s)]
*  surprised. It makes sense in retrospect. Anyone who was close to me ended up with a gun to their [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2287.6s)]
*  head. You know, being told that they had two options and one of them involved decades in prison. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2295.44s)]
*  And I mean, I think Ryan Salem is sort of the saddest example of that. And the most disgusting [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2302.0s)]
*  example from the government's perspective, where, you know, they charged him of totally bogus crimes. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2312.0s)]
*  He said, no, I'll see you in court. This, so they went back and said, all right, well, how about your [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2321.1200000000003s)]
*  pregnant wife? What if we put her in prison? And so he pleads guilty because they're going to [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2327.2s)]
*  put his wife in prison, which no same legal system would make that a permissible thing [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2335.68s)]
*  for a prosecution to do. And then, and he was even charged with most of what the other [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2342.64s)]
*  people who pled guilty were charged with. You know, Ryan, he doesn't testify at trial because [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2350.8799999999997s)]
*  he doesn't want to lie. He doesn't want to say what the government wants him to say. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2356.32s)]
*  And he ends up getting four times as much prison time as the other three guilty pleas combined. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2361.52s)]
*  And like, he couldn't send a clear message. Is it because he was a Republican or is it because he [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2369.1200000000003s)]
*  refused to parrot the government's lies at trial? Like, those are the only things I can imagine [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2372.8s)]
*  why they give him seven and a half years in prison. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2377.2000000000003s)]
*  It's disgusting. And I had him to my house and I interviewed him and I think they charged his wife [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2379.36s)]
*  as well. It's totally immoral what they did. They went back on their promise and charged his [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2386.6400000000003s)]
*  wife anyway, like, you know, just, just to sort of disabuse any notion of them sort of like operating [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2393.1200000000003s)]
*  good faith. It's disgusting. He's a good guy. I, you know, he didn't serve any of that. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2400.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2405.12s)]
*  Has it dawned on you, you know, I don't know what kind of news coverage you're getting, [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2407.3599999999997s)]
*  kind of contact you have with the outside world. It sounds like not too much, but that things are [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2411.92s)]
*  moving so quickly out here. Oh yeah. By the time you get out, I mean, AI, for example, it sounds [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2415.6s)]
*  like we're reaching AGI or some... Yeah. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2421.2799999999997s)]
*  Something singularity. Yeah. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2425.44s)]
*  Soon. Yeah. That you may emerge whenever you do into a world that, that doesn't look anything [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2427.12s)]
*  like the world you left. Yeah. I feel pretty acutely and it's, you know, the sort of feeling [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2432.88s)]
*  of the world moving on without you. Oh, is having children part of your [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2439.6s)]
*  effective altruism philosophy? No, different people in the community [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2450.08s)]
*  have different views on it. And at the end of the day, I mean, for five years, I felt like I had [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2454.56s)]
*  about 300 children most days, my employees, like it was obviously I couldn't be a father in the [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2460.72s)]
*  same way to all of them, but I felt responsible for them. I mean, feel terrible about all their [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2467.52s)]
*  work being tossed down the drain. But I didn't have time for my personal life at all, basically [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2474.48s)]
*  when I was running FTX. And I mean, I certainly am not in a position to have kids from in person. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2483.52s)]
*  So have any of those 300 employees visited you in jail? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2490.0s)]
*  No. I think the answer is no to that. You know, there's one or two... [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2499.12s)]
*  Probably ought to have some real kids at some point, don't you think? Because they, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2503.68s)]
*  when things go bad, they stick around. You know, it's got me thinking about [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2507.36s)]
*  what it means to have real friends. And it's and about the amount of power that some systems [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2512.3199999999997s)]
*  in our country end up having and the amount of intimidation that can be achieved implicitly, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2520.8799999999997s)]
*  but also about having people I know I can count on. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2529.6s)]
*  Yeah. Other people are all that matter. Sam Bankman Fried, I'm grateful that you did this [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2535.44s)]
*  and probably the only interview you ever do where you don't get pressed on your business, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2541.6s)]
*  because there are other people to do that. But I was glad to talk to you. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2544.88s)]
*  And I hope you'll give our best to Diddy. I will absolutely. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2547.6s)]
*  I can't believe you're in jail with Diddy. You know, someone told me three years ago, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2550.88s)]
*  like you'll be hanging out with Diddy, you know, every day, be like, oh, that's interesting. I [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2556.24s)]
*  wonder that's going to happen. I guess he gets into crypto or something. Life is so weird. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2559.68s)]
*  Godspeed. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2567.68s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing this show on one level. That's not surprising. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2571.12s)]
*  That's what they do. But on another level, it's shocking with everything that's going on in the [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2576.0s)]
*  world right now, all the change taking place in our economy and our politics with the wars, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2579.7599999999998s)]
*  when the cusp of fighting right now, Google has decided you should have less information [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2584.8799999999997s)]
*  rather than more. And that is totally wrong. It's immoral. What can you do about it? Well, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2590.08s)]
*  we could whine about it. That's a waste of time. We're not in charge of Google. Or we could find a [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2596.88s)]
*  way around it, a way that you could actually get information that is true, not intentionally [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2600.5600000000004s)]
*  deceptive. The way to do that on YouTube, we think it's to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2605.36s)]
*  hit the little bell icon to be notified when we upload and share this video. That way you'll have [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2610.6400000000003s)]
*  a much higher chance of hearing actual news and information. So we hope that you'll do that. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN1CR2dyfo8&t=2615.84s)]
