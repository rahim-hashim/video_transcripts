# Bernard Hudson New Orleans Attack, Cybertruck Explosion, CIA Corruption, & Tulsi Gabbard
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [January 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY)
*  So you served in the CIA for how long? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=0.0s)]
*  28 years. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2.7s)]
*  28 years. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3.7s)]
*  You joined when? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4.7s)]
*  1989, January. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6.7s)]
*  1989. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  And what did you do, roughly speaking, for CIA? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  So I was a case officer, which means my job was I was focused on foreign governments and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  foreign posts where you're trained up, given language skills, given set of skills to manage [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=19.82s)]
*  what we call tradecraft, how to operate clandestinely and safely overseas, and then you're assigned [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  undercover to an embassy. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=34.92s)]
*  And that sort of becomes your career with Stin Spaggen, what we call headquarters in [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=37.24s)]
*  Virginia. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=41.36s)]
*  What countries did you serve in? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=57.26s)]
*  So I served throughout the entire Middle East. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=65.08s)]
*  I was in Iraq. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  I was in Africa. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  I was in the Levant. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  I was in Pakistan. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  Where in the Levant? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  Jordan. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  What was Pakistan like? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  So Peshawar, Pakistan. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=81.64s)]
*  You were in Peshawar? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=84.64s)]
*  Yeah, but before 9-11 was the most alien place that I've ever gone. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=86.02s)]
*  I wasn't there permanently. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=91.06s)]
*  I would go in for business, but that was an alien place. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=92.06s)]
*  You think? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=96.58s)]
*  I was there two weeks after 9-11. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=97.58s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=98.58s)]
*  Yeah, it's even alien. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=99.58s)]
*  Even Pakistanis who live in Islamabad or Alpindi or Karachi, when they go into Peshawar will [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=101.18s)]
*  remark this is a different country. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=105.98s)]
*  This is really Afghanistan. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=108.6s)]
*  It just happens to be inside Pakistan's borders. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=110.4s)]
*  It's a cool town, don't you think? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=112.74000000000001s)]
*  It is very, if you like that sort of man who would be king vibe. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  The Flashman Hotel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  If you like the Flashman Hotel, if you like that sort of British late colonial chic, it's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  the place to go. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  The last flag bearer from the retreat from Kabul. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  The last guy who survived. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=132.68s)]
*  Yeah, rode in. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=133.68s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=134.68s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=135.68s)]
*  So you served an interesting post doing the kind of work that people associate with the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=136.68s)]
*  not reading foreign telegram posts back at headquarters. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=142.1s)]
*  No, I was thankfully spared that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=146.22s)]
*  I was able to actually serve and sort of undercover, working, trying to record or recruit what [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=148.94s)]
*  we call human sources and foreign intelligence to go back to our government. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=155.66s)]
*  How did it change the agency over the 28 years? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  So there were three CIAs that I served in. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  So there was the Cold War CIA that I joined in 1989. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=170.36s)]
*  Now I joined like only nine months before the wall came down. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=174.64000000000001s)]
*  But the ethos of that place up until, say, 91, it was always focused on Russia and the [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=178.88s)]
*  Soviet Union Warsaw Pact. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=184.24s)]
*  And then it went and I won't call it an identity crisis, but certainly a change in its character [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=187.72s)]
*  as the United States sort of moved into the peace dividend era, say sort of 91 when the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=194.32s)]
*  Soviet Union is no more and NATO starts expanding westward. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=199.66s)]
*  In that period, you know, you had a lot of basically a struggle to figure out what is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=204.38s)]
*  the agency really want to focus on. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  And it never really came to a clear answer until Tuesday morning, 11 September. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  And then it became the third agency that I served in. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=217.22s)]
*  Where were you? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=220.01999999999998s)]
*  So that morning I was at home. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=221.76s)]
*  I was in an apartment getting ready to go to an assignment overseas during my final [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=225.64000000000001s)]
*  preparations. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=229.56s)]
*  I saw that the news had said a plane had just struck a building in New York City. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  I thought that was pretty weird, clear day, a little suspicious. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  Jump in my car to go to CIA headquarters. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=242.0s)]
*  On the radio, I hear that they had just hit the second tower. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  And I get into the parking lot and there's a lot of things going on. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=249.60000000000002s)]
*  A woman tells me, I didn't know this person, but they said, you know, in the way things [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=255.2s)]
*  that happened on that Tuesday, people would talk to you who didn't normally talk to each [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=258.82s)]
*  other, hey, somebody just blew up the State Department. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=262.5s)]
*  Now that was obviously a garble of the plane hitting the Pentagon. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=267.26s)]
*  So I went into the building, went to the Near East section, which was my home division. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  Your home office is called the division in those days. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=278.21999999999997s)]
*  At that point, there was a report that there was a missing fourth plane headed to Washington. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=281.86s)]
*  The director of CIA probably smartly decided to evacuate the building because he didn't [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=288.16s)]
*  know where the target for the fourth plane was going to be. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=293.92s)]
*  But when you're young and aggressive, I decided I wanted to ignore that order. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  So I enlisted a friend of mine who was, as we were being told by the, they were called [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=303.18s)]
*  security protective officers who basically the guard force and the security force inside [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=308.22s)]
*  the agency were telling everybody to leave. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=312.78000000000003s)]
*  It was the first time I'd ever directly disobeyed an order in CIA and instead got a friend of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=315.54s)]
*  mine to go with me over to what was called the Counterterrorism Center where a friend [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=321.54s)]
*  of mine who I'd worked for before was the director and said, listen, you know, this [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=326.88000000000005s)]
*  is why I joined the CIA. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=331.96000000000004s)]
*  You know, I joined it to be ready to do something for my country when that time came and you [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=333.8s)]
*  never really know when that time is. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=337.8s)]
*  And that for me and for everybody else who was in the CIA in those years, that became [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=340.6s)]
*  the dominant mission. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=346.52000000000004s)]
*  You know, prevent another 9-11. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=348.72s)]
*  Figure out what the real threat is. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=351.72s)]
*  Find, fix that threat and then, you know, do something to make sure it doesn't ever [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=354.76s)]
*  happen again. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=360.74s)]
*  So where did you go from there? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=362.42s)]
*  So you're on your way somewhere. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=364.3s)]
*  Did you change destination? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=365.88s)]
*  No, I still went to the Middle East, to the Gulf region. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=367.72s)]
*  Perfect. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=371.0s)]
*  And served there for a number of years supporting operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=372.0s)]
*  What you learned in the early days of the global war on terrorism is that it really [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  was a global effort. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=383.20000000000005s)]
*  You know, the United States in those days, and it's kind of hard to understand now, had [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=385.6s)]
*  an enormous moral hand when it came to trying to get other countries to enlist with us to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=390.16s)]
*  work against the counter-terrorism threat. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=397.04s)]
*  And a lot of that, I think, was basically because a lot of countries woke up and realized [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=400.08000000000004s)]
*  that accommodating terrorists or turning a blind eye to them was injurious to their own [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=404.52000000000004s)]
*  fate and were eager to partner with the United States in those days. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=410.64000000000004s)]
*  In those days, do you think that's changed? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=417.04s)]
*  Well, certainly. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=419.32000000000005s)]
*  I mean, so you have the invasion of Iraq in 2003, which, unfortunately, the intelligence [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=420.4s)]
*  that led to the decision to go in there was deeply flawed. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=427.8s)]
*  And that had an enormous hit on the American intelligence community's credibility and [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=432.6s)]
*  U.S. foreign policy credibility. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=437.52s)]
*  Was there soul searching within the CIA after that? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=439.32s)]
*  I think there was. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=444.46s)]
*  I mean, I think what's unclear and what probably has to happen when something that egregiously [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=446.09999999999997s)]
*  wrong goes occurs, there's got to be a public facing piece of this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=452.53999999999996s)]
*  I think that was absent in the post 2003 environment. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=458.97999999999996s)]
*  I personally believe that this was the greatest intelligence failure of the American intel [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=464.41999999999996s)]
*  community in my, certainly in my time in government. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=471.18s)]
*  Well, sure, and a million people died and it reset. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=474.54s)]
*  It changed so much that I don't understand why they couldn't find somebody to say, we're [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=478.78000000000003s)]
*  going to punish this person, a guilty person, one would hope. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=486.1s)]
*  So what tends to happen in a modern bureaucracy, at least in the American version of it, is [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=490.38s)]
*  those type of mistakes are considered. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=497.02s)]
*  I'm not saying this is proper, but this is sort of how they approach it. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=500.26s)]
*  It's a systemic problem. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=503.5s)]
*  And so we're going to take all these steps to change the things that we think led to [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=505.7s)]
*  this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=510.74s)]
*  It is not including firing the leaders of that system, I notice. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=511.74s)]
*  That is true in the 2003 example. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=516.42s)]
*  What you don't have is what you might have and say a private sector company, we get something [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=519.38s)]
*  really, really wrong. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=523.62s)]
*  It's hard to compare the magnitude of the 2003 mistake on Intel with anything a private [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=525.1s)]
*  sector company would do. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=531.38s)]
*  But you got bureaucratic reform out of it, but what you didn't get, and it's fair to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=534.66s)]
*  say this, is you didn't get, say, 20 identified people who were told, you have to leave now. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=539.7s)]
*  Yeah, because I mean, you made the point by implication earlier that one of the reasons [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=545.46s)]
*  countries participated in the global war on terror with the United States, helped the [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=550.22s)]
*  United States, was because they had the example of countries that refused to participate or [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=553.78s)]
*  who worked against our interests and they got overthrown. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=559.34s)]
*  So there's something sort of instructive about punishing someone because it teaches everybody [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=562.38s)]
*  else not to do that thing, right? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=568.14s)]
*  Well, I think in the case of counterterrorism and the cooperation we got after 2001, I think [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=569.78s)]
*  the reason these countries cooperated is their own fear that radical Islamic terrorism [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=576.1s)]
*  was a threat to them as well. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=581.34s)]
*  What I think disturbed them after 2003 wasn't that anybody lamented the Saddam Hussein regime [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=583.26s)]
*  going away. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=589.26s)]
*  Here's the United States, the global remaining superpower, getting something so tragically [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=592.26s)]
*  wrong where along the way, many of the countries that are allies of the United States were [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=597.3000000000001s)]
*  are you really sure that you've got this story right? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=603.86s)]
*  I think what happened, what you start to see the glimmers of in the aftermath of the Iraq [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=607.62s)]
*  invasion is sort of that deference to American foreign policy begins to be questioned. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=612.42s)]
*  And I think in the immediate years after 2003, Russian China are still not pure rivals of [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=619.9s)]
*  the United States at that point. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=627.9s)]
*  But the repercussions, the ripples that came out of the Iraq invasion in regards to American's [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=631.14s)]
*  alliance system and how countries view it, I think underwent another change certainly [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=638.14s)]
*  by 2015-16 with the rise of China's economy and the return of sort of a more confrontational [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=644.1s)]
*  Russian policy in Syria. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=650.8199999999999s)]
*  In CIA, was there anyone who said, you know, wait a second, we should figure out exactly [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=656.34s)]
*  how this series of intel assessments got to the president and policymakers and like how [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=662.02s)]
*  did we do this and anyone who participated in it should be fired or did anyone say that? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=669.34s)]
*  So certainly many people said all of the points you made up to firing people. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=673.5s)]
*  There were some people who said that, you know, there needs to be accountability, personal [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=680.1800000000001s)]
*  accountability to named individuals. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=685.3s)]
*  The decision essentially was that we would hold the system accountable and they introduced [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=689.06s)]
*  a number of reforms. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=694.98s)]
*  One of them was to create a director of national intelligence, which didn't exist before 9-11. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=696.12s)]
*  I mean, 9-11 is actually when they created it, but it was empowered by what happened [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=703.12s)]
*  in 2003. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=707.9s)]
*  So if you were looking for a single event where somebody could say, you know, these [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=709.74s)]
*  people are personally held accountable, that did not happen after the Iraq invasion. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=717.22s)]
*  It's not just the WMD intel that remained unpunished. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=723.22s)]
*  It's like everything since then, every disaster since then has been without an author, I notice. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=726.98s)]
*  Again the way America... [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=733.58s)]
*  The president was set. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=735.58s)]
*  So, again, the way it tends to work in an American bureaucracy is you get sort of collective [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=738.54s)]
*  punishment if you will, or collective change. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=744.3s)]
*  It's like systemic racism. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=747.78s)]
*  Everyone's against it, but no one can quite describe what it is. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=748.78s)]
*  Yes, or you don't point out a particular individual. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=751.98s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=755.78s)]
*  So the DNI is one of the bureaucratic bolt-ons, one of the responses to the obvious intel [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=757.22s)]
*  failure in the run-up to the war in Iraq. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=766.2s)]
*  What is... [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=768.32s)]
*  It's a war in 2001 actually, so it was 9-11. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=769.32s)]
*  I'm sorry, right, it was 9-11. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=772.6s)]
*  I beg your pardon. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=775.32s)]
*  What exactly is it? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=777.6s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=778.6s)]
*  So it's changed over time. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=780.2800000000001s)]
*  So essentially the DNI, Director of National Intelligence role, is to make sure that there's [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=783.0s)]
*  a single accountable person to the president who is responsible for all of the production [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=789.2800000000001s)]
*  and all of the assessments that come out of the intel community. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=796.0400000000001s)]
*  So there are 18 agencies, including the Director of National Intelligence as an office, not [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  a person, inside the US intel community. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=803.72s)]
*  Before there was a DNI, the Director of CIA had two hats. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=808.08s)]
*  Hat one, Director of the CIA. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=812.44s)]
*  Hat two, Director of something called Director of Central Intelligence, which is essentially [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  the process by which the president and the senior leadership get something called the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=820.2s)]
*  President's Daily Brief, which is called the PDB. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=825.0s)]
*  It's a classified newspaper that speaks to issues of interest overseas to the American [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=827.24s)]
*  government. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=834.04s)]
*  So the DNI was created, it was given the authority to manage that classified newspaper, if you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=835.52s)]
*  want to call that. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=841.3199999999999s)]
*  That was one of its duties. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=842.4399999999999s)]
*  Duty two was you as the DNI are responsible for looking at how do we do collection across [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=844.16s)]
*  the board, agency by agency, which agency is collecting what type of information? [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=851.0s)]
*  Is there duplication? [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=856.56s)]
*  Is that duplication necessary? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=858.24s)]
*  It also has sort of a mundane but important role in determining budgets and managing not [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=861.04s)]
*  necessarily the execution of, not so much execution of budgets, but pulling a budget [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=868.24s)]
*  together for the IC and being accountable to talking to Congress about it. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=872.8s)]
*  As it is lived, you know, there are issues that some people have and questions people [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=878.68s)]
*  have raised over the years about why does the DNI need to be as large as it does. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=884.64s)]
*  It doesn't collect unique information. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=889.3599999999999s)]
*  Unique information is collected by the 17 other agencies that are out there. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=893.8399999999999s)]
*  But it collates it. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=897.04s)]
*  It collates it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=898.04s)]
*  The one thing that some folks have talked about, a role that the DNI could do, but it [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=899.04s)]
*  hasn't to date, is a more aggressive assessment of how each of the agencies really contribute [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=903.8s)]
*  to the overall IC mission, essentially grading the homework. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  Can you list the 17 other members of the intelligence community? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=914.92s)]
*  For points, I guess I could probably do it. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=919.3199999999999s)]
*  So nine of them are within the Department of Defense. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=921.16s)]
*  Nine. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=924.0799999999999s)]
*  Nine of them. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  So Army Intelligence, Marine Corps Intelligence, Navy Intelligence, Air Force Intelligence, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  Don't forget the Air Force. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=931.64s)]
*  You have the National Security Agency, which is part of DOD, the National Geospatial Agency, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=933.82s)]
*  which is an agency that looks at exploiting imagery and making sense of pictures. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=939.4s)]
*  If you think of the Cuba Missile Crisis and the analysts who are looking at crates and [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=944.0400000000001s)]
*  boxes to determine is that just a crate or is that a crate carrying a Russian missile, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=950.0400000000001s)]
*  that's the modern version of where those people went. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=956.0s)]
*  It's a very little known agency, but it actually has a really important mission. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=958.9200000000001s)]
*  The National Reconnaissance Office, which manages America's satellite system. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=963.6800000000001s)]
*  Then you have seven agencies that are part of other government cabinets level agencies. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=969.4s)]
*  So for example, Treasury's intel section, the Department of Energy's got an intel section. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=979.1800000000001s)]
*  The State Department has something called the Intelligence and Research INR. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=986.08s)]
*  You've got the Coast Guard and you have Department of Homeland Security. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=992.32s)]
*  Why would the Department of Energy have its own intel component? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=999.0s)]
*  So unique to the American intel community, the Department of Energy has got a bunch of [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1002.6s)]
*  authorities dealing with nuclear weapons and the design of nuclear weapons, both in the [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1008.08s)]
*  United States and what we need to know about potential adversary or partner countries that [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1013.48s)]
*  have nuclear weapons. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1017.6s)]
*  And so they have a very small, it's a very small office inside the Department of Energy. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1019.5600000000001s)]
*  But it's a fair question. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1024.16s)]
*  People will say, why don't we just have one agency that takes care of all of this for [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1025.32s)]
*  so many different organizations? [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1030.84s)]
*  And I think over the years, certainly within DOD for the nine agencies they've got, they [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1032.68s)]
*  are technical enough and they need them focused particularly on that particular service. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1039.2s)]
*  Like the Air Force has a particular set of things that they need to carry out their mission [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  that are not necessarily the types of information the CIA might collect. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1049.8s)]
*  Some of the things CIA might collect would be of use to the Air Force, but there's a [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1054.08s)]
*  lot of things that CIA wouldn't collect that the Air Force, for example, might need and [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1057.76s)]
*  that they prefer to have their own unit. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1063.0s)]
*  It's mostly analytical to assess foreign air developments. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1065.04s)]
*  If you're still using Verizon, AT&T or T-Mobile, obviously there are condolences, but you're [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1070.24s)]
*  going to want to hear this. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1074.68s)]
*  Our cell phone company, PureTalk, gives us the exact same service you're currently getting [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1076.36s)]
*  from those big companies, but for half the cost. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1080.52s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1082.86s)]
*  There's no reason to spend $85 or $100 per month per person on your wireless bill. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1083.86s)]
*  Now we can get unlimited talk, text and 15 gigs of data with mobile hotspots for just [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1089.22s)]
*  $35 a month. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1094.0s)]
*  You don't have to be a math major. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1095.0s)]
*  The average family of four saves about $1,000 a year with PureTalk. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1098.08s)]
*  You enjoy America's most dependable 5G network, support small businesses. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1101.88s)]
*  We would know that because they are now powering TCN. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1106.44s)]
*  It can probably save you money too. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1109.2s)]
*  So cut the fat out of your wireless bill. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1111.4s)]
*  Switch to PureTalk by going to puretalk.com slash Tucker. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1112.92s)]

*  So the Director of National Intelligence sits in some way, but not literally atop all of [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1122.28s)]
*  these other agencies? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1128.56s)]
*  So they sit atop it. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1129.56s)]
*  It gets a little complicated when people think, is there a org chart that says the Director [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1132.2s)]
*  of National Intelligence can give an order that one of these other agencies have to follow? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1138.04s)]
*  Or could it cut their budget if the Director of National Intelligence wanted? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1143.54s)]
*  That becomes more of a political issue. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1148.16s)]
*  Some of that has to do with how money is allocated by Congress. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1150.32s)]
*  So we talked about how nine of these agencies are actually within the Defense Department. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1154.12s)]
*  Well, that means their ultimate boss is the Secretary of Defense. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1159.52s)]
*  And the Secretary of Defense has an enormous say in how those agencies are operated. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1163.48s)]
*  So really, the DNI's authorities are looking at how these agencies really contribute to [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1169.1599999999999s)]
*  the overall American collection and exploitation of information effort. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1177.08s)]
*  President Trump is nominated former Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gafford to be the Director [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1181.52s)]
*  of National Intelligence. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1185.72s)]
*  She's facing enormous resistance in Washington, most of it not public. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1188.48s)]
*  You came out publicly in support of her. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1192.96s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1195.96s)]
*  So I've noticed her career from early on when she was a congressman. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1197.78s)]
*  Myself and others, CIA officers and other people in the government, I think we're sort [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1202.32s)]
*  of interested in here's somebody who has served her country. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1207.88s)]
*  She was still, in fact, I believe she was a congressman and serving as an army reservist, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1211.8s)]
*  who actually raises some thoughtful questions about the purposes of American foreign policy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1218.0s)]
*  Her comments in some of the debates I found to be extraordinarily unusual for an American [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1228.2s)]
*  politician, in particular when she challenged the front runner Hillary Clinton on the effects [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1236.64s)]
*  of some of her foreign policy decisions, I think in particular on Libya. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1246.0800000000002s)]
*  So I thought Tulsi Gafford was a solid choice to be the DNI. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1250.78s)]
*  I've been a bit surprised by some of the vitriolic response to her nomination because when you [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1256.94s)]
*  look at on paper her background, it's consistent with other people who've had senior jobs in [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1265.02s)]
*  the US intel community. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1272.46s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, John Ratcliffe, in some ways of real Haynes, who's now the current Director [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1274.46s)]
*  of National Intelligence, some of her background is not at all dissimilar to some of them. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1279.98s)]
*  I don't think Tulsi Gafford ever ran a pornographic bookstore, while Avril Haynes did, I think [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1285.06s)]
*  in Baltimore. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1290.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm not aware of her background on that. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1291.8600000000001s)]
*  But just for the record, I don't think that Tulsi Gafford ran a pornographic bookstore. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1294.8600000000001s)]
*  I wouldn't think so. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1298.78s)]
*  It would seem to be inconsistent. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1300.22s)]
*  What was also sort of interesting to me was she took a lot of heat for being skeptical [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1303.82s)]
*  on things that I'm not so sure it wasn't right to be skeptical on. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1314.46s)]
*  Such as? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1318.4199999999998s)]
*  So in particular, I am sympathetic to when she was a congressman and went to Syria and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1319.6399999999999s)]
*  to figure out what is US policy interest in Syria. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1329.1s)]
*  And I was also trying to get to the bottom of, I think in her mind, and I can't speak [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1336.8999999999999s)]
*  for her, but it's my outside assessment, the question about whether or not the Assad [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1340.3s)]
*  regime used chemical weapons on its own people. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1346.34s)]
*  Now the Assad regime was brutal. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1350.86s)]
*  Both the father and the son ran one of the most diabolically brutal regimes that they've [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1352.8999999999999s)]
*  ever had in the Middle East. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1357.1399999999999s)]
*  However, what she was trying to look at was had they escalated the use of chemical weapons. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1359.1799999999998s)]
*  When you think about all the people who were participating in what we call the global war [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1367.4599999999998s)]
*  on terrorism or the Iraq veterans, I wouldn't blame any of them for being skeptical about [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1371.6599999999999s)]
*  what the US intelligence community might have said about another Arab state having a weapon [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1378.3s)]
*  of mass destruction. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1383.6599999999999s)]
*  On the basis of no disclosed proof at all. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1385.5s)]
*  I push the State Department, if this is true, what do I know? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1391.3s)]
*  I'm not there. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1394.18s)]
*  But where's the evidence? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1395.34s)]
*  And a lot of the goodwill and trust had been extinguished by what happened in 2003. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1397.7s)]
*  So again, in my view of Tulsi Gabbard and other veterans of the Iraq war and occupation, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1404.86s)]
*  which was an opposed occupation, it got fairly bloody at times. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1413.02s)]
*  So if you're there in that country serving, and at some point you ponder, you know, how [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1416.74s)]
*  did we exactly get here? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1421.26s)]
*  And somebody tells you, well, it's, you know, the American intel community, you know, assess [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1422.94s)]
*  that there was WMD here. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1427.94s)]
*  They got it wrong. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1430.0s)]
*  Flash forward. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1431.34s)]
*  Now you're a congressman. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1432.34s)]
*  Someone is, you know, laying out yet another case that there might have been chemical weapons [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1433.34s)]
*  use. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1437.9s)]
*  So you're concerned that is this a prelude to not only just tagging and assigning culpability [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1440.34s)]
*  to an evil regime, but some sort of opening move in a much more aggressive US involvement [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1445.9399999999998s)]
*  in that country. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1453.22s)]
*  So I, on that, you know, just as a, as someone who myself was in Iraq, and very familiar [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1454.5s)]
*  with other people who've served there, I don't blame any of them for wanting to ask two, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1461.98s)]
*  three, four questions about the existence of WMD in an Arab state in the first, you [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1466.22s)]
*  know, say decade after, after like 2003. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1473.18s)]
*  I never understood, like when did Congress pass the law requiring me to hate Assad? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1476.82s)]
*  There are lots of brutal regimes in the Middle East, some of which we support. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1481.74s)]
*  I would argue as brutal as Assad's regime. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1485.22s)]
*  Just my view, but whatever. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1488.06s)]
*  But there are other countries. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1489.06s)]
*  But why was I required? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1490.78s)]
*  I'm agnostic about Assad. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1492.54s)]
*  I support him, thinks any protected Christians. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1494.82s)]
*  That's my personal view. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1497.3799999999999s)]
*  But I, when did it become like some requirement that, you know, all good people hate Assad? [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1498.3799999999999s)]
*  Where did that come from? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1502.82s)]
*  I was just confused by it. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1503.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, you get sort of, you know, sometimes shifting standards on what, you know, what [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1505.1399999999999s)]
*  constitutes a threat. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1512.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1513.46s)]
*  I do believe that probably by the end of his administration, even the Obama people had [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1514.46s)]
*  come to conclude that Syria was probably not a direct actionable threat to the United States. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1520.1799999999998s)]
*  Now it's fair to say that during the occupation of Iraq, that the Syrian government knowingly [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1530.2199999999998s)]
*  allowed plenty of people to cross that border who were going to, you know, attack US troops [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1535.6599999999999s)]
*  in that country. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1541.34s)]
*  But you know, there are ways to deal with that. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1543.4599999999998s)]
*  And I think, again, when you look at US policy towards Syria, it's always been fairly hostile. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1547.82s)]
*  You know, it's never outside of a very short period of time in the first Gulf War, when [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1553.7s)]
*  Bashar Assad, the father, or Hafez Assad, the father, had gone along with the Americans [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1559.66s)]
*  to push back Saddam's invasion of Kuwait. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1565.26s)]
*  We've always had a bad relationship with that regime. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1567.62s)]
*  So any reason? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1570.58s)]
*  It was particularly brutal. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1573.3s)]
*  It was also a legacy of the Cold War, very close to the Soviets. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1575.34s)]
*  It's easy to forget now, but the Syrian regime under the Assad family hosted a number of [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1582.94s)]
*  terrorist organizations that did attack American interests in Europe and other places. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1588.78s)]
*  They hosted terrorist groups. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1595.78s)]
*  They helped destabilize Lebanon, which was an important small ally of the United States [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1598.86s)]
*  at the time in the 70s and 80s. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1603.58s)]
*  So that gets us back to sort of the Third World Movement and Soviet surrogates. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1606.06s)]
*  The non-aligned countries. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1613.06s)]
*  Non-aligned countries. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1614.06s)]
*  And then you add on to that just sort of a uniquely strange cult of personality, where, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1615.34s)]
*  for example, in Iraq, the name Assad also means, you know, it's a lion in Arabic. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1621.9399999999998s)]
*  People wouldn't want to use the word for lion in Arabic because that would require them [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1629.14s)]
*  to say the president's name, the name of the president's family. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1634.5s)]
*  The fear that the average person had in Syria was astounding. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1637.42s)]
*  I remember going there on a trip at one point and just it was saturated with secret police [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1643.7800000000002s)]
*  everywhere. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1652.2s)]
*  I would call it the not so secret police because you'd be walking around Damascus and you could [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1653.2s)]
*  see clearly these guys there. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1657.22s)]
*  And really, their focus was domestic repression. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1661.22s)]
*  You know, it was really not looking for foreigners. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1665.14s)]
*  So it's not to say that you're absolutely right. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1668.1000000000001s)]
*  There are many terrible regimes in the world. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1670.18s)]
*  The Assads, you know, were at least noteworthy within the Arab context. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1673.6200000000001s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1678.5s)]
*  So she dared to go talk to Assad, went to Syria, Tulsi Gabbard. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1680.18s)]
*  But you know, that was seven or eight years ago and she never endorsed Assad or anything [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1688.1000000000001s)]
*  like that. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1693.6000000000001s)]
*  She's got pretty conventional views on most issues, I would say, foreign policy issues. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1694.6000000000001s)]
*  She's not like anti-Israel or she's, you know, she's within the mainstream on most things. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1699.7s)]
*  But the resistance to her is very, very intense. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1706.8200000000002s)]
*  Where do you think that comes from? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1709.28s)]
*  I think some of it seems to come from a sense that she is not deferential to the foreign [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1711.08s)]
*  policy consensus. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1718.36s)]
*  And within Washington, you know, there is a sense that there, I mean, there clearly [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1721.24s)]
*  is a foreign policy consensus, you know, and that's true of almost any government, you [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1727.16s)]
*  know, any government that has a foreign policy and that has security services. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1731.8s)]
*  There tends to be sort of a worldview that's coalesced, that generally coalesces and is [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1735.72s)]
*  held by the majority of the people who work there. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1741.44s)]
*  I think she's a bit of a disruptor when it comes to that and is willing to challenge [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1744.68s)]
*  things. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1749.5600000000002s)]
*  I would agree with you that I don't really understand sort of the vitriol of some of [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1750.92s)]
*  this. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1755.4s)]
*  I don't think it really is warranted. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1756.4s)]
*  Calling her a traitor to her country? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1757.4s)]
*  This gets to the sort of absurd lens that people have sometimes fallen to about trying [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1759.64s)]
*  to go after their domestic opponents. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1769.06s)]
*  I mean, here we have somebody who was and is a lieutenant colonel in the US Army, which [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1770.68s)]
*  means she has security clearance, probably top secret clearance, and, you know, making [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1777.16s)]
*  statements as serving government officials or recently, you know, retired government [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1782.26s)]
*  officials that this person is probably a Russian agent. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1786.6s)]
*  I find it curious that the same group of folks who might say that the McCarthy era was [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  extreme. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1798.84s)]
*  Well, they've embraced it completely. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1799.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, it's you know, the McCarthy era is not a how to manual. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1801.08s)]
*  It was a cautionary tale. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1805.24s)]
*  I mean, they got us into war with Russia from my perspective on the basis of this hysteria. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1806.6399999999999s)]
*  It's it's beyond belief. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1811.4399999999998s)]
*  So here's my concern. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1814.08s)]
*  Trump gets elected on the explicit promise to end pointless wars, defend the United States [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1815.8s)]
*  when necessary, but we're not no more wars of choice. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1820.08s)]
*  They haven't helped the foreign policy consensus. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1822.0s)]
*  Moreover, isn't working, obviously. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1824.12s)]
*  It's not helping the United States in any measurable way. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1827.6399999999999s)]
*  And people are very sick of it. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1830.24s)]
*  And he said that in 2016 got elected. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1831.8s)]
*  He said it again in 2024 and got elected. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1833.9199999999998s)]
*  And yet the overwhelming majority of the nominees so far are well within the foreign [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1836.76s)]
*  policy consensus. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1842.32s)]
*  They're neocons. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1843.12s)]
*  And she's not. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1844.52s)]
*  And so don't you think Trump voters deserve an appointee once in a while? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1845.8s)]
*  I guess that'd be my view. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1850.52s)]
*  But that's like too much for D.C. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1851.6s)]
*  That this is my read. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1853.08s)]
*  They can't you can't have anybody who disagrees with Mike Pompeo, like not allowed. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1854.36s)]
*  That seems pretty dysfunctional to me. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1859.24s)]
*  Well, I don't get consulted on these sorts of issues. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1863.56s)]
*  But as an observer, like. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1865.6s)]
*  So, you know, part of. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1867.96s)]
*  I think part of what you're seeing here is, you know, that sort of independent [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1872.8s)]
*  thinking and really questioning in some ways what we got for our efforts of the [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1877.6000000000001s)]
*  last 25 years, you know, certainly since 2003, you know, to essentially assess [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1884.04s)]
*  that you've developed inside the United States something I like or something I've [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1892.72s)]
*  heard people call militarism without victory, where you have this sort of. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1896.24s)]
*  Consistent push to the most aggressive options on the table. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1901.84s)]
*  But you're not Sparta. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1906.64s)]
*  You keep losing. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1907.72s)]
*  Well, and we certainly, you know, we don't gain much even from some of the [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1908.72s)]
*  ones that we've won on. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1913.1200000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1914.36s)]
*  And so I think. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1914.72s)]
*  I'm not sure that a lot of the professional national security establishment [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1918.2s)]
*  has as a group really come to that conclusion yet. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1926.56s)]
*  I think individually, you know, when you talk to folks who had careers in the [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1930.2s)]
*  military, the security services, state department, they'll privately admit that, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1934.96s)]
*  you know, if you name Libya, Iraq, the certainly the occupation of Afghanistan [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1939.76s)]
*  post the death of Osama bin Laden, that it's really hard to say that we really [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1946.0s)]
*  got very much as a country out of that. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1950.72s)]
*  But there certainly, you know, is, you know, relevancy that you get as the [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1953.8799999999999s)]
*  United States by being able to sort of impose your will on situations. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1959.8s)]
*  And it's important if you're going to be a superpower to be able to impose your [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1964.96s)]
*  will, if you have to do so. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1968.24s)]
*  What has changed, I think over the last 20 years is the threshold to want to [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1972.04s)]
*  impose that will seems to have gotten down to a fairly hair trigger. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1977.04s)]
*  And so things that I would think, you know, we would have stayed out of when [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1980.52s)]
*  we had a standoff with the Soviet Union, or at least thought twice about people [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1984.1200000000001s)]
*  are now a little bit of a knee jerk reaction that, you know, let's move this [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1988.92s)]
*  two steps up the escalation ladder. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1993.88s)]
*  Not always warranted. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1998.0s)]
*  Well, and reckless because the consequences of misjudging and you can only [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=1999.72s)]
*  control one side, of course, yours. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2005.4s)]
*  It gets to your question on, you know, why Tulsi Gabbard? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2007.0s)]
*  I like skepticism in senior intelligence officers. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2009.56s)]
*  In my experience, you know, being overly credulous or being willing to sort of [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2013.64s)]
*  believe the most extreme version of an event, even if it later turns out to be [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2019.64s)]
*  true, certainly at the senior levels, it's well worth it to be, to have some [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2023.6s)]
*  people in the loop who are prepared to ask some very hard questions about [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2029.44s)]
*  the consequences from asking those hard questions. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2033.8799999999999s)]
*  If you really want to be an effective director of national intelligence, you [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2036.76s)]
*  probably have to go into work every day with the expectation that this might be [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2040.52s)]
*  my last day, I might be forced to say something or do something that will be [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2044.76s)]
*  unpopular unwelcome, but I think it's necessary for the system to have a couple [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2048.84s)]
*  of folks around who are prepared to take that risk. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2055.08s)]
*  And from my experience, I think it's important to have a couple of folks [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2058.0s)]
*  take that risk. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2062.56s)]
*  And from what I saw of her career, and I don't know her personally, she seems [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2063.2s)]
*  like somebody who, despite being on the fast track in the Democratic Party, she [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2067.8s)]
*  was the vice chair of the DNC presidential candidate, was willing to put her [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2071.56s)]
*  personal ethics and personal views, you know, on the table and say, you know, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2079.72s)]
*  for this, I'm prepared to suffer. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2085.8s)]
*  And that's a good thing to have for the American Intel enterprise, in my opinion. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2088.1600000000003s)]
*  It seems vital. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2095.28s)]
*  So then the question arises, like, where's the oversight of these incredibly [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2098.56s)]
*  powerful agencies, which have, you know, by definition, the power to spy on [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2102.92s)]
*  people and kill them and do, someone from outside should be making certain that [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2107.84s)]
*  what they're doing is within the bounds of the Constitution and decency. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2113.4s)]
*  And I don't see anybody, I see the House and Senate Intel committees as [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2117.96s)]
*  completely controlled by the IC. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2121.56s)]
*  I mean, I've seen it. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2123.44s)]
*  Is that, like, what's the view from within CIA on that? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2125.1600000000003s)]
*  There's any, like, anybody in the House and Senate, particularly the Senate, who [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2128.6400000000003s)]
*  will say you can't do that, will pull your budget if you do that? [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2132.2000000000003s)]
*  So I think there have been instances where, you know, you've had that sort of [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2135.52s)]
*  oversight. Now, some of it, you know, goes back historically, so your church [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2140.76s)]
*  committee, so which is the, you know, long, that's a long time ago. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2144.2s)]
*  That's sort of the high watermark of, you know, oversight having a significant [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2148.0s)]
*  effect on the IC. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2153.9199999999996s)]
*  You know, since then, and, you know, in my experience was mostly, you know, post [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2156.56s)]
*  9-11 in dealing with Congress, that there was fairly robust interest in what the [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2159.7999999999997s)]
*  agency does. To be fair, there was a lot of support, you know, for the IC in the, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2164.96s)]
*  in Congress, historically, generally is. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2171.08s)]
*  You know, the CIA would say that that's because, you know, they try to be [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2174.2799999999997s)]
*  consistent with what they think, you know, Congress will accept and what the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2177.96s)]
*  administration wants. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2181.52s)]
*  It's always worth remembering that the IC in the end works for the executive [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2182.48s)]
*  branch and the president. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2187.0s)]
*  Obviously, their budgets and some of their authorities are controlled by the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2188.2s)]
*  laws that Congress, Congress puts on them. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2191.72s)]
*  Your question is a really good one, or maybe a little bit of a little bit of a [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2197.08s)]
*  question on is in a low trust society or a society where trust is now at a [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2200.56s)]
*  premium, you know, how does the IC manage the suspicions of an increasingly larger [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2206.72s)]
*  number of people in the American population? [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2214.88s)]
*  I'll just say as the son of a federal employee who spent most of his life in [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2217.24s)]
*  DC, I always wanted to trust the government and in fact did. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2220.16s)]
*  And it was, you know, learning that what government was doing with my money and [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2223.7999999999997s)]
*  I was so outraged by it. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2228.6400000000003s)]
*  I have no more trust. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2229.84s)]
*  And so I think that, I mean, that's just my perspective. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2231.52s)]
*  I'm sure everyone has a different perspective, but I applied to CIA and didn't [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2233.96s)]
*  get in, but that's a measure of how much I believed in the system. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2239.36s)]
*  And so from my perspective, it's low trust because they violated our trust. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2243.48s)]
*  And I think, you know, however we got here, I think one of the things that I [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2248.32s)]
*  would like to see the IC and those who manage it accept is that we really are [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2253.36s)]
*  here, that this is, you know, a situation where highly partisan atmosphere in the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2258.08s)]
*  United States, not everybody is going to reflexively trust the security services. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2262.92s)]
*  And if they really want to be able to perform their mission appropriately and [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2268.52s)]
*  effectively, they've got to be in a place where the people trust them. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2272.2s)]
*  But on whose behalf are they performing it? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2276.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, they have no authority at all other than that conferred to them by the [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2278.16s)]
*  president of the United States. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2283.48s)]
*  That's it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2284.7599999999998s)]
*  Period. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2285.36s)]
*  Because his authority comes from voters, it's our system. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2286.04s)]
*  And he confers that to the executive branch agencies of which CIA is one. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2288.92s)]
*  And so if he doesn't want them to do something, they have no moral or [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2292.7999999999997s)]
*  constitutional right to do it. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2296.2799999999997s)]
*  Period. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2297.52s)]
*  I don't, I don't see another way. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2298.52s)]
*  As, as, as a, as a legal measure, you know, if a president, you know, as long as it's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2299.8399999999997s)]
*  lawful, gives an order to the, you know, to the IC, especially the CIA, which [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2304.2799999999997s)]
*  directly works for the president, doesn't even work. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2309.2799999999997s)]
*  We talked about the nine other Intel agencies. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2311.64s)]
*  They work for the secretary of defense, by extension, the president, of course. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2314.24s)]
*  Um, yes, they, you know, they have to obey lawful orders that are given to them. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2318.68s)]
*  But they're not allowed to freelance. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2322.4799999999996s)]
*  Like by whose authority are they doing that? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2325.08s)]
*  How can, how can, and not just CIA, I don't mean to pick on one, the most famous [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2327.04s)]
*  of all the federal agencies, but I mean, there are many others, maybe all of them [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2330.7599999999998s)]
*  doing things that the president ran against that he did not authorize, which [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2335.0s)]
*  in other words, they have no legal or moral right to do, but they do it and no [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2341.48s)]
*  one's ever punished like on whose authority do they think they're acting? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2345.88s)]
*  Again, I think, you know, come 20 January, you know, we're going to, once the executive [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2350.28s)]
*  and one presumes that there'll be a number of executive orders that will come out of [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2356.2000000000003s)]
*  the white house, you know, that the president will be able to lawfully provide. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2360.16s)]
*  At that point, you know, if people in the IC or the IC leadership is not responsive, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2365.36s)]
*  you know, there's plenty of mechanisms for a president and a white house and [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2370.7599999999998s)]
*  national security advisor to determine, you know, if they're not in, as they say [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2374.4s)]
*  in the, in the IC not aligned with what the president wants them to do. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2379.64s)]
*  President and the director of CIA have very broad authority to remove people. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2384.0s)]
*  Very broad. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2388.2799999999997s)]
*  We did an interview with a woman called Casey Means. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2388.96s)]
*  She's a Stanford educated surgeon and really one of the most [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2392.32s)]
*  remarkable people I have ever met. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2396.04s)]
*  In the interview, she explained how the food that we eat produced by huge food [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2398.84s)]
*  companies, big food in conjunction with pharma is destroying our health, making [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2404.52s)]
*  this a weak and sick country. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2409.88s)]
*  The levels of chronic disease are beyond belief. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2412.0800000000004s)]
*  What Casey Means who we've not stopped thinking about ever since is the [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2416.0800000000004s)]
*  co-founder of a healthcare technology company called Levels. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2420.7200000000003s)]
*  And we are proud to announce today that we are partnering with Levels. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2423.96s)]

*  Levels is a really interesting company and a great product. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2430.36s)]
*  It gives you insight into what's going on inside your body or metabolic health. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2433.48s)]
*  It helps you understand how the food that you're eating, the things that you're [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2438.2000000000003s)]

*  And you don't think about it. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2445.04s)]
*  You have no idea what you're putting in your mouth and you have no idea what [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2445.96s)]
*  it's doing to your body, but over time you feel weak and tired and spacey. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2448.0s)]
*  And over an even longer period of time, you can get really sick. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2453.92s)]
*  So it's worth knowing what the food you eat is doing to you. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2456.76s)]
*  The Levels app works with something called the continuous glucose monitor, a CGM. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2461.56s)]
*  You can get one as part of the plan or you can bring your own. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2466.56s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2468.6800000000003s)]
*  But the bottom line is big tech, big pharma and big food combined together to form an [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2470.08s)]
*  incredibly malevolent force, pumping you full of garbage on healthy food with [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2476.96s)]

*  That they were reading his texts and listening to his calls and there was nothing [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2579.7599999999998s)]
*  he could do about it. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2582.3199999999997s)]
*  And I said, why don't you hold a press conference? [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2583.3599999999997s)]
*  I mean, that's like so outrageous. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2585.48s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2587.0s)]
*  Can't do that. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2588.7999999999997s)]
*  You saw the chairman of the Senate Intel committee violated some agreement. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2590.4399999999996s)]
*  See, I thought that she had with them and they spied on her. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2599.0s)]
*  They spied on Senate staff. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2601.68s)]
*  They got caught and no one. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2602.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2604.88s)]
*  So, and actually the Senate didn't do anything about it. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2605.24s)]
*  They didn't say, you know, we're going to expose your black budget or, you know, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2607.76s)]
*  defund parts of you, we're going to fire you. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2610.64s)]
*  No one did anything. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2613.08s)]
*  So what does that tell you? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2614.68s)]
*  If the agency can spy on sitting senators who are supposed to be in charge of them [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2616.08s)]
*  or their budget anyway, what does that tell you about how afraid people are? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2620.6s)]
*  So let me take this in reverse order. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2625.48s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2628.28s)]
*  So I think you're talking about the Feinstein statement. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2628.52s)]
*  So as you know, my understanding of how that happened is that they accused the agency [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2632.12s)]
*  of being able to look at the computers. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2640.2s)]
*  Correct. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2641.96s)]
*  In the Senate. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2642.72s)]
*  That were in the CIA building that the Senate staff had access to and that there [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2644.88s)]
*  were government computers with CIA information on it and that all of those [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2651.32s)]
*  computers come with a warning both written on the, the, on the cover of the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2656.08s)]
*  computer and when you boot it up, that this is a government system and it's fully [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2663.48s)]
*  auditable. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2668.2s)]
*  So it's my understanding that the computers in question, you know, that, you [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2669.4s)]
*  know, Senator Feinstein said were improperly accessed by the agency. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2674.12s)]
*  Were in fact, you know, CIA computers that were made available to them, but with the [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2679.08s)]
*  clear warnings that anything on this computer that you do, not some other computer [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2683.44s)]
*  that you would be on, not your personal handheld device, those computers are [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  accessible by CIA security, just like every other computer that the CIA buys and [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2693.64s)]
*  makes available for its own employees. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2700.7200000000003s)]
*  So that there's an audit function on all of that. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2702.92s)]
*  Now I had never heard, you know, that the allegations ever extended to other [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2705.96s)]
*  computer systems that people in the Senate were using that were not provided by [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2711.08s)]
*  the CIA. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2716.0s)]
*  Now again, I'll caution that I, you know, I'm not, I wasn't directly involved in [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2717.3199999999997s)]
*  that. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2720.88s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that Senator Feinstein said and alleged that CIA was spying on her [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2720.96s)]
*  staff in order to push back against her expected pushback against them. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2726.96s)]
*  In other words, to control her. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2731.96s)]
*  I was aware she said that. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2734.96s)]
*  Again, you know, my understanding is the only, you know, audits that were going on [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2736.2799999999997s)]
*  of any computers were ones that were clearly marked as this is a computer owned by the [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2741.3999999999996s)]
*  government subject to audit. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2745.64s)]
*  So I, I can't speak to, you know, I mean, what I can't speak to is never in my career, [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2747.68s)]
*  did anybody ever approach me and say anything about. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2753.72s)]
*  I was spying on members of Congress. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2758.2s)]
*  Never. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2759.8399999999997s)]
*  No one ever, no one ever asked me to do it. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2760.6s)]
*  No one I know ever told me that they were involved in it. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2763.04s)]
*  And it's a fairly small place. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2766.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2768.6s)]
*  I'm not saying that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2769.24s)]
*  So if a member of Congressional Intel Oversight Committee says, I believe CIA or NSA is [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2769.8799999999997s)]
*  spying on my personal communications in an effort to control me, do you think that's a [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2777.6s)]
*  crazy thing to say? [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2782.2799999999997s)]
*  I think it's troubling if any member of Congress believes that. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2785.12s)]
*  You know, not only believed it, like I think the person believed it, told me in a [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2788.52s)]
*  restaurant. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2791.6s)]
*  But I said, that's like completely outrageous. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2793.24s)]
*  And actually you can't have a democracy under those circumstances. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2795.48s)]
*  So you should hold a press conference and say, I can't do that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2798.0s)]
*  So really to me, it's unprovable whether or not they were spying on his phone. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2800.7999999999997s)]
*  Maybe he's a nutcase. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2804.7999999999997s)]
*  It's a pretty famous person, but could be a nutcase. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2807.12s)]
*  But what I was struck by was the fear. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2809.92s)]
*  Like, I can't do that. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2812.12s)]
*  And that's, I would say what you've just told me, that would be if I was still in [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2814.0s)]
*  government, that's the thing that would trouble me. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2818.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2819.92s)]
*  Is it if our relationship with our oversight has reached this sort of a level where [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2820.16s)]
*  they would entertain that type of a... [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2825.16s)]
*  Where you're more, where CIA is more powerful than the people overseeing CIA. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2826.6s)]
*  That's not good. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, again, in all my interactions, when I would go down and testify or provide, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2830.7999999999997s)]
*  you know, background briefings to Congress, you know, it was always with the [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2836.0s)]
*  understanding, you know, that the CIA has a office, you know, that deals with [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2840.24s)]
*  collaboration and oversight. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2845.44s)]
*  It was always like, you've got to make sure everything you say is accurate. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2847.6400000000003s)]
*  If you say something that's not accurate, you've got to come back and explain that [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2850.6000000000004s)]
*  you got it wrong, that you submitted something that was, you know, in error. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2854.36s)]
*  It was always deferential in my level and with what I experienced. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2859.36s)]
*  But if I had become aware that, you know, a senior senator had said something like [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2865.52s)]
*  that or a congressman at any level, I'd say we definitely have a problem. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2869.88s)]
*  You know, we need to reestablish trust. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2874.88s)]
*  Well, I have... [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2876.64s)]
*  However it has to happen. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2877.6s)]
*  And if somebody had ever told me that we're spying on, you know, congressmen, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2878.68s)]
*  you know, I wouldn't have followed an order like that. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2884.56s)]
*  And most of my friends that I know who were there wouldn't have followed an [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2887.36s)]
*  order like that. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2890.32s)]
*  I just, I never believed any of this stuff. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2893.04s)]
*  And then the closer I got to it, the more I thought there's something really wrong [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2895.24s)]
*  here and that the, almost with that exception, the members of Congress who [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2897.92s)]
*  are the most vocal cheerleaders for the IC are the ones with the most to hide in [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2902.08s)]
*  their personal lives. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2907.24s)]
*  I've definitely noticed that theme. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2909.84s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2911.8s)]
*  And I feel like there's probably a connection. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2913.92s)]
*  Does that make sense? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2915.8s)]
*  Again, I never saw, heard, or even got a whiff of anything like that. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2917.92s)]
*  You know, Washington just played by some pretty hard rules, you know, within the [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2926.8s)]
*  political world. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2929.64s)]
*  But, you know, again, if I'd ever been in a meeting, you know, where somebody had [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2932.2799999999997s)]
*  said, Hey, you know, we're going to, you know, dish some dirt on some congressmen. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2936.08s)]
*  It would have been utterly shocking and appalling. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2941.68s)]
*  Yes. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2945.52s)]
*  And I think, again, most of the employees I know would refuse to carry out an [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2946.12s)]
*  order like that. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2951.04s)]
*  It would actually think this is some sort of bizarre joke. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2951.6s)]
*  I just, I just can't see how you would easily be able to do that without other [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2955.68s)]
*  people knowing. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2960.9199999999996s)]
*  It's a very gossipy place, the CIA. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2962.72s)]
*  It's just, it's so striking to me that members of Congress who represent districts [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2965.08s)]
*  where just, for example, you know, the overwhelming majority in Republican [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2972.3999999999996s)]
*  districts, the overwhelming majority of their voters don't want to send another [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2976.64s)]
*  $20 billion to Ukraine, just to give one among many examples. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2979.12s)]
*  And then they show up, they go into the skiff, they get the briefings and they're [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2983.84s)]
*  in favor of doing something that their own constituents hate. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2989.64s)]
*  And so there's a control mechanism in place there, obviously, whether it's, you [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2993.56s)]
*  know, as sinister as, you know, whether it's sinister or not, I don't know. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=2999.0s)]
*  But what is that? [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3002.16s)]
*  Well, I do think, you know, just like any mature bureaucracy, you know, the, the [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3003.7200000000003s)]
*  Intel community, any federal agency can make a very good case for why they think [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3009.4s)]
*  something needs to be done. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3014.44s)]
*  And I mean, a case on its merits, you know, so, you know, Kissinger used to have an [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3015.96s)]
*  old joke that he would get three types of briefings, you know, one is, or three [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3020.6800000000003s)]
*  types of options, total nuclear war, abject surrender, and then something in [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3024.76s)]
*  the middle, you know, it, that's still a fairly common play across the US [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3030.84s)]
*  government. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3037.2s)]
*  So it is entirely possible that, you know, busy congressmen and senators who [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3037.9199999999996s)]
*  have an awful lot of things that they've got to be focused on, they come in to [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3044.64s)]
*  deal with an agency that they have oversight on. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3049.68s)]
*  Generally speaking, that agency has an information advantage over them on, you [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3052.68s)]
*  know, details and can lay out a very good case for what it is they want to do. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3057.2s)]
*  I'm not saying it's necessarily a wise case, but they can lay out a compelling [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3061.04s)]
*  case. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3065.08s)]
*  And there is a sense I did notice in my career of a deference to, well, these are [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3066.7999999999997s)]
*  the experts, you know, they're careerists who've been doing this for all their [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3073.48s)]
*  life, you know, pushing back on that could make, you know, it's a bit of a [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3078.08s)]
*  lonely place to be. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3083.3199999999997s)]
*  So I think, you know, in some ways, you know, Senate and House staffs, they don't [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3085.36s)]
*  have a lot of them, you know, they have a lot people think they do, but when you [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3091.36s)]
*  think about all the things that they've got to evaluate, especially when they [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3094.72s)]
*  deal with, you know, complex issues, war and peace, national security, there's an [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3098.9599999999996s)]
*  awful lot of deference that does apply to the agencies. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3104.72s)]
*  When Senator Chuck Schumer, the head Democrat in the Senate, says to Rachel [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3108.8799999999997s)]
*  Maddow, man, Trump made a huge mistake messing around with the IC, they'll [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3112.52s)]
*  screw you six ways to Sunday. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3117.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's a hard one to square. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3120.16s)]
*  That's a, you know, I remember when that statement was made. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3122.96s)]
*  And again, you know, wasn't in the part of the CIA that I had any access to. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3126.76s)]
*  And I, but that's the side of statement that doesn't contribute in any positive [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3132.32s)]
*  way. [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3139.12s)]
*  But does it reflect reality? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3139.7200000000003s)]
*  It certainly didn't reflect a reality that I was a part of, you know, I retired [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3144.12s)]
*  in 2017. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3147.7200000000003s)]
*  Clearly it's become fairly toxic, you know, in Washington, and, you know, it's [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3148.76s)]
*  not unfair to say that some of that toxicity does, you know, reach into, you [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3155.76s)]
*  know, the government, you know, the federal agencies. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3160.5600000000004s)]
*  But when people make statements like that, you know, whether it's bravado, or [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3166.48s)]
*  you know, they think it's true, it fuels that mistrust. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3171.32s)]
*  So one of the things that the intel community could do to restore trust is [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3175.76s)]
*  declassify things that have no legitimate reason to be secret, like any [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3180.5600000000004s)]
*  files pertaining to the Kennedy assassination from 62 years ago. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3185.36s)]
*  And yet they are ferocious, the CIA in particular, ferocious opponent. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3189.36s)]
*  In fact, because I bumped up against it myself, ferocious opponents of [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3193.76s)]
*  declassifying that information. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3198.48s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3200.28s)]
*  So there is a sort of a reflexive circling of wagons when it comes to [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3201.84s)]
*  secrecy in the IC. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3207.7200000000003s)]
*  I think in the case of the Kennedy assassination and probably things [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3209.92s)]
*  certainly dating back, maybe even less than that, there's an overwhelming [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3213.0800000000004s)]
*  public benefit to sharing that data. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3216.84s)]
*  But in that specific case, it was so long ago, so many books have been [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3221.04s)]
*  written about it. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3224.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3225.28s)]
*  In that specific case, it was so long ago, so many books have been written [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3227.4s)]
*  about it. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3230.4s)]
*  It's a cliche. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3231.44s)]
*  It's almost a parody at this point. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3232.6000000000004s)]
*  The Kennedy assassination, it's like, if you can't give an inch on that. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3234.0s)]
*  And by the way, as of two weeks ago, I happened to know they were still [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3237.32s)]
*  fighting it like ferociously. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3242.0400000000004s)]
*  No, you cannot appoint that person. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3243.76s)]
*  That person might disclose those files. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3245.0800000000004s)]
*  What? [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3248.52s)]
*  What is that? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3250.0400000000004s)]
*  So what I'll say next, I'll say as a person who spent most of my adult life, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3251.36s)]
*  you know, in the Intel community, I would be very curious as to how [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3257.0s)]
*  somebody would try to justify that. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3263.2s)]
*  I mean, the only thing that I could think of is that, you know, government [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3265.48s)]
*  files would include theories of a crime or an event that later get to be [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3269.24s)]
*  disproven. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3275.68s)]
*  So in the early days of some kind of an event, you know, you're going to have [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3276.32s)]
*  agencies and parts of your agency generate things. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3281.04s)]
*  But I think American democracy can handle that. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3284.28s)]
*  And it demands it. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3287.76s)]
*  I was the president of the United States. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3288.8s)]
*  Well, I mean, and I mean, the president has absolute declassification [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3290.4s)]
*  authorities. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3294.32s)]
*  So people can dislike it. [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3294.84s)]
*  But if the president says you will declassify everything related to [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3298.2400000000002s)]
*  subject X, his declassification authority is as broad and absolute as [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3302.5600000000004s)]
*  his pardon power. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3310.4s)]
*  Why would Pompeo fight so hard to keep those files secret? [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3311.44s)]
*  I don't. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3315.1600000000003s)]
*  I really don't know. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3315.56s)]
*  If the president had said that they wanted something declassified, I don't [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3317.64s)]
*  understand why they would say that, you know, they would push back on it. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3323.56s)]
*  Do you think CIA had a role in the president's murder in 1963? [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3328.36s)]
*  I personally don't. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3332.32s)]
*  You know, if I had to guess, you know, could I see a situation where [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3333.6800000000003s)]
*  could I see a situation where dots didn't get connected that should have [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3338.8s)]
*  been connected, you know, things dropped off the table, somebody looked at a [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3344.0800000000004s)]
*  piece of information and said, well, that's not really all that important. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3347.6800000000003s)]
*  That said, you know, I have friends of mine who are retired CIA officers who [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3354.6400000000003s)]
*  who at least entertain the idea that the agency of 1962, 1963, you know, it's [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3360.6800000000003s)]
*  possible. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3367.36s)]
*  I don't personally see that. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3368.52s)]
*  But this could all be cleared up if they just put out whatever they have. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3372.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3378.48s)]
*  I mean, it, it seems very unlikely to me after all these years, there could be [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3378.6800000000003s)]
*  anything in those files, which are of course, physical files that, yeah, of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3383.4s)]
*  course, you know, really they're still there sitting in a manila folder, like [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3388.56s)]
*  telling us who the assassin was working for or whatever, telling us the truth. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3394.28s)]
*  I have a lot of trouble believing they'd still be there if they were ever there. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  The only reason that I'm focused on it is because I know for a fact that there [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3404.2000000000003s)]
*  are CIA employees, I know this for a fact, dead certain fact, I just was [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3408.16s)]
*  hearing about it, are trying to prevent certain people from getting jobs on the [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3411.6s)]
*  basis of their belief that those people will push for declassification. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3416.2000000000003s)]
*  I think, again, I, for the people I knew when I was in the agency and the people [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3420.88s)]
*  I know who are still there, if I were still in, I would reflect my reflexive [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3426.96s)]
*  position would be, okay, there's, there's really no reason that something's that [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3433.4s)]
*  long ago can't be declassified in Toto. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3437.04s)]
*  What about the 9-11 files? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3441.52s)]
*  So we're moving on, you know, we're getting close to 25 years later. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3443.44s)]
*  All the governments in that region are different from what the Saudi [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3447.68s)]
*  government's completely different. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3452.3599999999997s)]
*  I don't understand, and there are all these theories about what actually [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3454.16s)]
*  happened and it's clear that we don't know the full story, whether the full [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3458.7999999999997s)]
*  story is sinister or not, you know, I hope not, you know, but I don't, you [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3463.12s)]
*  would do a lot to heal American society by putting doubts to rest. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3467.7599999999998s)]
*  And if these really are like dangerous conspiracy theories, then prove it. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3472.0s)]
*  Like, why wouldn't? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3475.2s)]
*  They release all those files. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3477.44s)]
*  Well, I'll go on the record of saying, you know, I believe 9-11 was perpetrated [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3480.48s)]
*  by who we said it was, you know, and some of those people are still down in [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3484.2s)]
*  Guantanamo Bay waiting for justice. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3488.56s)]
*  Others are dead. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3490.48s)]
*  I'm very confident the IC had nothing to do. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3494.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, there's no deep state actors or, you know, putting demolitions [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3498.04s)]
*  in the towers in New York. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3502.72s)]
*  There really was a plane that hit the Pentagon. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3506.16s)]
*  I think, I think you could make a good case that there's no reason not to [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3509.16s)]
*  declassify most of this stuff. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3515.64s)]
*  What I would expect, you know, might be troublesome. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3517.24s)]
*  It's possible that, you know, you know, some of the early documents are wrong, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3520.8399999999997s)]
*  you know, materially wrong. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3527.08s)]
*  You know, when you're reporting on contemporaneous events, some of [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3528.7599999999998s)]
*  your reports will be wrong. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3532.72s)]
*  I think people can understand that, okay, this is something that came out, you [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3534.7200000000003s)]
*  know, a week after 9-11, it's incorrect. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3538.4s)]
*  It was proven. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3541.48s)]
*  It was a theory of the crime that was disproven. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3542.08s)]
*  I personally believe if it would advance, you know, building more trust with the [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3547.1600000000003s)]
*  government and the IC, which I think is absolutely critical to having, you know, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3552.32s)]
*  effective national security defense. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3556.4s)]
*  I personally don't think that there's any reason you can't declassify most of [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3558.88s)]
*  those things, if not all of them. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3562.64s)]
*  I agree with you on all counts. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3565.7999999999997s)]
*  It is critical to national security and defense to have trust between the [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3567.24s)]
*  population and the government and employees to protect it, right? [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3572.64s)]
*  So trust is not just like this thing you wish you had, it's this thing you need [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3575.72s)]
*  in order for the system to continue. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3580.4s)]
*  So yeah, and if people believe that there wasn't a plane that flew into the [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3583.12s)]
*  Pentagon or that the CIA or Mossad or somebody else other than the 19 hijackers [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3586.3599999999997s)]
*  did this, prove them wrong. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3592.08s)]
*  Like wouldn't that, it would just be good for everybody, would it not? [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3594.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3597.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, you know, I remember years ago, actually, you know, some people in [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3597.96s)]
*  El Cade are discussing this, you know, weirdly that, you know, they were upset [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3603.08s)]
*  that people were trying to take their credit from them for, you know, doing [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3606.7599999999998s)]
*  what they did on 9-11, because, you know, for them, it was an important part of [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3610.3199999999997s)]
*  their, you know, their credibility with their own folks that they were able to [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3613.88s)]
*  pull this off. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3618.6s)]
*  So I, I see no reason that they probably can't. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3619.24s)]
*  It was five years ago this month that people started to drop dead in the [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3622.64s)]
*  central Chinese city of Wuhan. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3626.2s)]
*  Five years since the beginning of COVID, tens of millions dead, societies [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3628.48s)]
*  reordered completely, economies destroyed. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3633.0s)]
*  And yet for some reason, we still don't know answers to the most basic questions. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3636.04s)]
*  Where did this virus come from? [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3640.48s)]
*  How did it get here? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3641.9199999999996s)]
*  Why did the government tell us to do things they knew wouldn't work? [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3643.3599999999997s)]
*  None of those questions have been adequately answered. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3646.68s)]
*  And one man knows those answers. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3648.96s)]
*  His name is Dr. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3650.84s)]
*  Tony Fauci. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3651.52s)]
*  Until now, nobody has really pressed. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3652.64s)]
*  And now a documentary filmmaker called Jenner First is out with a new film [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3655.68s)]
*  explaining exactly what happened. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3660.44s)]
*  The film was called Thank You Dr. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3662.7200000000003s)]
*  Fauci. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3664.36s)]
*  Jenner First spent years trying to get answers. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3665.04s)]
*  And in that time, as he awaited Dr. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3667.28s)]
*  Fauci's response, he went through tens of thousands of pages of documents and [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3668.92s)]
*  pieced together the story, which is shocking. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3673.68s)]
*  We are proud to host that documentary here on TCN from December 20th to January 19th. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3675.68s)]
*  You will see it exclusively here on TCN. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3680.92s)]
*  Again, it's called Thank You Dr. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3683.2s)]
*  Fauci. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3685.16s)]
*  And it's worth it. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3686.12s)]
*  Then why the effort, and CIA has, I think it's been, well, it has been [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3696.2s)]
*  documented and participated in this effort to discredit people who ask [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3700.4s)]
*  questions or who have alternate theories. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3704.6s)]
*  Why not prove them wrong rather than resort to character assassination, [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3706.48s)]
*  conspiracy theorists, et cetera? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3710.7599999999998s)]
*  So again, you know, when I was in the agency and what me and my colleagues did, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3713.08s)]
*  we were focused on collecting foreign, actionable foreign intelligence abroad. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3717.72s)]
*  You know, if somebody on the internet had something to say, you know, that was [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3722.92s)]
*  completely at odds with what we knew to be the truth, you just sort of baked [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3730.0s)]
*  that in to how you did what you did. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3733.68s)]
*  It's a political question. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3737.3599999999997s)]
*  It's really a White House decision. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3738.48s)]
*  You know, if the White House had decided, you know what, it's in our national [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3740.3199999999997s)]
*  interests to put everything out on the table that we have. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3744.52s)]
*  You're making a fair point, a true point. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3749.04s)]
*  And a president can make that happen. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3751.44s)]
*  Just like a president can pardon anybody, a president can bulk declassified [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3754.6s)]
*  data if they want to. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3758.96s)]
*  And there's literally nothing the federal workforce or the agencies could do to [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3760.4s)]
*  push back on that. [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3765.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm praying for that to happen because I think it's necessary for healing. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3768.0s)]
*  Sincerely, too much is classified, too much is secret. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3772.0s)]
*  It's unfair on its face, but it's also corrosive of trust. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3776.28s)]
*  I think that's my view. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3779.7200000000003s)]
*  Tell us about security clearances. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3781.88s)]
*  Security clearances, let me just say for context, as someone who lived in DC, are [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3783.2400000000002s)]
*  held by a lot of people who are not federal employees, a lot of contractors, a [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3787.96s)]
*  lot of retired people, have security clearances and they use those to make [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3790.7200000000003s)]
*  money in the private sector or from government working as contractors. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3794.76s)]
*  And it seems like people leave government service and just continue on with their [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3801.16s)]
*  security clearance, which from my perspective as a US citizen who's paid his [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3804.52s)]
*  taxes for 55 years, seems a little unfair. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3809.44s)]
*  Like why should John Brennan, who's not a federal employee, get to see top secret [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3813.04s)]
*  information, but I can't? [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3815.92s)]
*  Like what? [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3817.36s)]
*  He's not a federal employee. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3817.8s)]
*  I don't really understand that system. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3819.36s)]
*  So, you know, I'll caution this by, I'm not an expert on how they do what we [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3821.68s)]
*  call contractor clearances, but you know, in the years after 9-11, the federal [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3826.7599999999998s)]
*  workforce didn't grow as much as the work grew, and so what happened was there [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3833.92s)]
*  was an increasing reliance on private companies to do and to augment the [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3838.44s)]
*  federal intelligence community. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3846.08s)]
*  Those companies would have to hire people who would need to get security [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3849.16s)]
*  clearances and those security clearances have to be the equivalent of the ones [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3853.12s)]
*  that a federal employee had to do the same work. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3856.2s)]
*  So in many cases, what you had were federal employees who reached the point [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3860.0s)]
*  of retirement, but let's say they're still relatively young, 50, 52, and they [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3865.16s)]
*  go to work for these contracting companies that have contracts back in [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3871.4s)]
*  the government, and in that case, they need to maintain their clearance and [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3876.6800000000003s)]
*  can lawfully retain their clearance because they're working on a government [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3881.32s)]
*  contract through an approved vendor. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3885.1600000000003s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3887.88s)]
*  Now that you probably have a much smaller number of instances where people who [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3889.7200000000003s)]
*  don't fit into that category might still be authorized to have access to [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3894.96s)]
*  security clearance and occasional briefings from the government. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3901.3199999999997s)]
*  And what happens, again, a very narrow number of folks, usually cabinet [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3905.9199999999996s)]
*  secretaries, people who have careers where they're still engaged with, say, [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3911.04s)]
*  foreign policy in the private sector, and the government deems that it's [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3920.3599999999997s)]
*  advantageous to keep these people updated on certain developments. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3924.72s)]
*  Usually they don't get access to the same information that an in-service [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3929.16s)]
*  federal employee might get, but they might be given a briefing on developments [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3934.72s)]
*  in a certain part of the world because they travel there a lot. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3939.0s)]
*  They can still be an effective voice for American policy if they're informed. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3944.12s)]
*  But that's a very tiny... [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3949.48s)]
*  So Tony Blinken, for example, is now the secretary of state. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3951.0s)]
*  He will be until January 20th, God willing. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3953.6s)]
*  And his views are completely at odds with those of the incoming president, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3956.44s)]
*  completely at odds, and he's working hard to undermine the incoming Trump [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3961.56s)]
*  administration in Ukraine, pushing to get Ukraine and NATO or some [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3965.72s)]
*  insane thing like that. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3970.12s)]
*  He plans to retain his security clearance. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3972.72s)]
*  He's hired a lawyer to argue the case if it comes to that. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3975.08s)]
*  I happen to know. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3978.88s)]
*  Why, on what grounds could Tony Blinken, even if you thought he did a good job [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3980.12s)]
*  as secretary of state, which I want to say once again, I don't, but like, [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3984.88s)]
*  why does he have a right to a security clearance when he leaves federal [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3988.7599999999998s)]
*  service as an appointee? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3992.2s)]
*  Well, nobody has a right to it. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3993.44s)]
*  Right. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3994.7599999999998s)]
*  And again, you know, the DOD and whatever the home agency is where your [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=3996.16s)]
*  clearance is quote, being held, have an absolute right to grant, revoke, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4004.2s)]
*  or not issue a clearance. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4008.44s)]
*  And certainly a president, if they, if the president decided this person does [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4011.1200000000003s)]
*  not need access to classified information, it would be unusual for a president to [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4015.2000000000003s)]
*  sort of name somebody like that. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4019.76s)]
*  But it's too thin. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4021.04s)]
*  As far as I understand, it's well within his authority to say this person [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4022.1600000000003s)]
*  doesn't need a security clearance. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4026.96s)]
*  And the person would have to be able to articulate, even if a president wasn't [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4029.8s)]
*  involved in making a decision like that, the person petitioning to get a [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4033.32s)]
*  clearance or to keep it would have to have an, a reason that's actionable [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4037.24s)]
*  into the benefit of the government to do so. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4042.72s)]
*  You know, I'm not aware of the specifics of, of, you know, a former cabinet level [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4045.64s)]
*  officer trying to keep a clearance. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4049.8799999999997s)]
*  I would imagine if the new administration said that they didn't approve it or [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4052.2s)]
*  concur that it's essentially an unreviewable decision, probably it's being [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4057.3199999999997s)]
*  Washington, you could probably find an attorney who would take your case on. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4063.2s)]
*  But, you know, presumably, even if you had a clearance, they don't have to [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4066.68s)]
*  actually give you any access to anything. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4072.2799999999997s)]
*  Just because you have a clearance, it isn't a badge that allows you to get into [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4074.56s)]
*  a physical place and access data. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4077.24s)]
*  Somebody still has to proactively check that you have a clearance and then brief you. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4079.6s)]
*  Right. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4084.2s)]
*  But the reason I think that it's significant is because it sets up legal [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4084.52s)]
*  penalties for the transfer of classified information to you if you don't possess [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  a clearance. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4093.12s)]
*  So in other words, if you're Tony Blinken and you leave January 20th, you want to [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4093.56s)]
*  continue to undermine the administration, which he does, you can remain in contact [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4097.28s)]
*  with your former employees at state or throughout the US government, your allies, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4102.5599999999995s)]
*  and receive classified information and no one's breaking the law. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4106.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you don't have a clearance, you know, then you could get John [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4108.88s)]
*  Karakoud for it. [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4112.76s)]
*  So. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4114.4s)]
*  And again, an administration has broad authorities about who can have a clearance. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4115.44s)]
*  And just because a former official wants one, they don't have a right to keep it. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4121.5599999999995s)]
*  What do you make of these apparent terror attacks in New Orleans? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4129.599999999999s)]
*  Well, the attack in New Orleans and then the exploding cyber truck in Las Vegas. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4135.08s)]
*  So, you know, it's early. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4140.88s)]
*  And one of the things I learned, you know, in my time dealing with terrorist [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4143.28s)]
*  actions and in an intel world is, you know, you want to be careful about what you [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4147.08s)]
*  think you believe, but you still get the story. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4150.88s)]
*  What we know so far about New Orleans is it looks like other types of attacks [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4153.8s)]
*  we've seen over the years, sort of somebody becomes self-radicalized and [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4158.96s)]
*  then carries out, you know, an extreme act with little preparation time ahead of, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4164.32s)]
*  ahead of the actual attack. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4169.2s)]
*  So often in these types of cases, you know, somebody may have been thinking about [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4171.24s)]
*  doing some violent action. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4175.92s)]
*  Something happens in their life. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4178.400000000001s)]
*  They see, think, or believe something and they simply are triggered. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4179.84s)]
*  The initial information, you know, from that I was reading earlier today was that [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4184.320000000001s)]
*  the attack or whatever happened, you know, the explosion in front of Trump Hotel is [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4190.08s)]
*  not related to, or they haven't detected any connections with what happened in [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4195.16s)]
*  New Orleans. Now, I think as a, if I was still in government and two events [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4200.52s)]
*  happened on the same day or within, you know, 24 hours of each other, that has [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4205.24s)]
*  sometimes been the hallmark of an organized terror attack. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4211.0s)]
*  And as a working theory, it's worthwhile to at least look into it. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4213.599999999999s)]
*  You know, however, what little we know, and we don't know much about the attacker [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4217.12s)]
*  in Las Vegas, he doesn't seem to be the same political persuasion. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4221.76s)]
*  Again, we don't know a lot yet of the attacker in New Orleans. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4229.36s)]
*  Now you have two possibilities here. [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4235.92s)]
*  You know, one, they're connected, which means that it was an organized effort and [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4239.0s)]
*  somebody missed it. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4242.96s)]
*  Initial indications are that's probably not the case. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4244.96s)]
*  The other option is, is that you've got two independent attacks, you know, if this [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4248.04s)]
*  is really an attack, if it's really political in Las Vegas. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4253.599999999999s)]
*  What that would tend to tell you, and especially when you add in the attack or [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4261.0s)]
*  the murder of the United Healthcare CEO, which was clearly in many ways, act of [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4264.64s)]
*  political terrorism, is something changing in the political atmosphere, [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4270.6s)]
*  which is already toxic, that is triggering a certain set of our population to say, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4275.36s)]
*  you know what, whatever my personal beliefs are, they are so pushed to the edge that [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4281.76s)]
*  at this point, I feel I've got to execute or make some kind of a statement, a [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4288.16s)]
*  violent statement that I've been sitting on for quite some period of time. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4291.68s)]
*  So I think it's too early to tell, you know, are we looking at my, you know, is [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4297.36s)]
*  this sort of the new normal where as politics becomes more toxic in America, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4303.12s)]
*  that people decide, you know, to take violent action on their own. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4308.44s)]
*  We do know that violent acts tend to open the door to other violent acts. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4313.2s)]
*  You know, people who are inclined to do these type of things when they see a [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4318.08s)]
*  violent political act will often, you know, see that as like, well, you know, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4322.04s)]
*  that that person can do it, I can do it. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4326.92s)]
*  We just simply don't know. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4329.5199999999995s)]
*  So there's no indication that you've seen, I mean, because everything you've [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4332.2s)]
*  said suggests you think this is just domestic entirely. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4336.2s)]
*  There's no foreign actor. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4339.68s)]
*  I don't, I mean, inspired. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4340.4800000000005s)]
*  So the guy in New Orleans apparently, you know, was consuming ISIS type [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4342.72s)]
*  propaganda and, you know, according to the, you know, what's in the papers or [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4347.4400000000005s)]
*  the, you know, the news media had produced a couple of videos en route to [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4352.360000000001s)]
*  the attack site making pro-ISIS statements. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4356.360000000001s)]
*  So in that case, yes, he's inspired by ISIS, foreign terrorist group, but it [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4358.88s)]
*  doesn't sound like, you know, he was getting any direction or had any help, [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4366.24s)]
*  which is its own troubling type of terrorism when they do this on their own [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4369.92s)]
*  and they don't require a conspiracy. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4375.12s)]
*  It's very hard to catch them. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4377.400000000001s)]
*  Of course. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4379.0s)]
*  I mean, there've been an early report, you know, that the vehicle [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4379.68s)]
*  involved that come across from Mexico. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4382.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4385.400000000001s)]
*  No, that seems and maybe not be true, but it does bring up an interesting [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4387.16s)]
*  point, which is, and part of the reason I think that had a lot of currency. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4392.5599999999995s)]
*  It's very hard to have an effective counter-terrorism policy if you don't [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4397.68s)]
*  have border control because terrorism is about people, it's people who carry it out. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4401.76s)]
*  You know, in the last four years, we've had something like 9 million people show [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4407.36s)]
*  up at our borders unannounced and have been allowed to come in and stay. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4411.84s)]
*  9 million people, if you aggregate it out on a monthly basis, is one US Marine Corps [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4417.72s)]
*  worth of people every single month for four years. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4422.72s)]
*  It's impossible to vet or to know anything meaningful about a Marine Corps worth of [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4427.76s)]
*  people coming into this country every month for four years. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4433.76s)]
*  As a former intelligence official myself, I've been in the United States for four [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4437.32s)]
*  years, and I've been in the United States for four years. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4442.32s)]
*  Intelligence official myself, somebody responsible for counter-terrorism [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4445.2s)]
*  operations and Intel, if somebody had told me, well, we need you to guarantee [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4449.08s)]
*  that, you know, you've got a screening process where we could look at who these [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4455.08s)]
*  people are so we know who we're letting in, that's impossible. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4458.72s)]
*  You don't even know what these people's real names are. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4462.68s)]
*  You don't know anything about their backgrounds. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4464.68s)]
*  It's an enormous black hole of information that there's no easy solution. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4466.76s)]
*  If you're not going to have border controls that are effective, it's very hard [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4475.84s)]
*  to have an effective CT policy. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4481.2s)]
*  Counter-terrorism policy. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4483.5199999999995s)]
*  Counter-terrorism. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4484.64s)]
*  So, you know, you left in 2017, I think you said. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4485.28s)]
*  I did. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4489.48s)]
*  But, you know, your friends who stayed who were in counter-terrorism, I mean, they [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4490.84s)]
*  must have looked on with horror at this. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4493.88s)]
*  I think there have been, you know, I've never heard anybody tell me that if you [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4498.68s)]
*  don't have control of your borders, that you can have good counter-terrorism policy. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4503.24s)]
*  In fact, I remember when I was in service, you know, like many of us, I had a chance [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4508.72s)]
*  to actually talk to people who'd been terrorists, you know, honest to goodness, [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4513.12s)]
*  you know, gun carrying terrorists. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4517.92s)]
*  And you ask them sort of, okay, of all the things that governments do that make it [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4520.56s)]
*  hard for you to do what you do as a bad guy, what are some of those things? [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4525.76s)]
*  The top two were, the number one was getting across borders where they [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4532.4800000000005s)]
*  ask a lot of questions. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4537.28s)]
*  They said, that's an extremely tough thing to get around. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4539.24s)]
*  You know, that's, it's the single easiest thing a government can do. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4544.4400000000005s)]
*  To isolate itself from at least a big element of terrorism, which is [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4550.68s)]
*  transnational terrorism. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4554.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm not a counter-terrorism official, but that was obvious to me. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4555.36s)]
*  How could Biden administration officials who abetted this not know that? [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4559.12s)]
*  I can't think of any credible counter-terrorism official I know who [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4566.16s)]
*  have asked the question, can you guarantee that you're able to validate [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4570.52s)]
*  up to 200,000 people a month who are coming through our border? [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4576.72s)]
*  That's on, you know, that's not possible. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4581.68s)]
*  It's simply impossible to know even what their real names are. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4584.68s)]
*  So I think the implication is that you would not be surprised if we see acts [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4592.240000000001s)]
*  of terrorism in this country accelerate. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4598.56s)]
*  No. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4601.88s)]
*  I mean, without effective border controls and in a world where, [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4602.5199999999995s)]
*  um, you, America has legitimate enemies. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4606.839999999999s)]
*  It does. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4611.639999999999s)]
*  You know, you may, people may say, well, we shouldn't have made that person or [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4612.12s)]
*  that country an enemy, but we live with the reality that we have. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4614.759999999999s)]
*  You're, it's a needless and avoidable risk that we've taken that we could easily [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4620.88s)]
*  do something to prevent and tighten that up very quickly. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4627.5199999999995s)]
*  No, it's an act of hostility toward the United States. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4631.32s)]
*  I would say to allow that. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4633.48s)]
*  Uh, what are the things that we've done that have engendered hostility? [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4635.0s)]
*  Well, it's so there's, you know, there's two ways that you can engender [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4639.599999999999s)]
*  hostility, one, you know, carrying out something that's important to you. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4642.84s)]
*  That, you know, in the course of events, you know, you have to impose your will [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4646.5199999999995s)]
*  on a foreign country or a foreign organization because it's in your [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4650.04s)]
*  legitimate interests and they don't like it. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4653.8s)]
*  You know, and that's an awful lot of this, you know, in other cases, you know, [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4656.36s)]
*  you know, you know, some of the long occupations that the United States has, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4660.92s)]
*  some of its foreign policy decisions, you know, which, you know, may or may not [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4665.96s)]
*  be controversial with the American people, which maybe there's no consensus [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4670.44s)]
*  on, will tend to generate ill will with a certain percentage of the world's population. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4673.5199999999995s)]
*  So when you were in all these countries and I love how you refer to the [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4680.12s)]
*  region, not the country, um, but I quite a, quite a few countries, it [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4683.599999999999s)]
*  sounds like over 28 years carrying out tasks that you were asked to carry out. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4687.96s)]
*  Um, were you struck when you came home about how little your fellow Americans [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4693.6s)]
*  knew about how we were projecting power abroad? [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4698.24s)]
*  So, you know, the thing about narrative is that the people who tend to buy the [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4702.76s)]
*  narrative the most are your own people. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4709.4s)]
*  And so what I, it's easy as an American, not to really understand how you are [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4711.72s)]
*  perceived in another country. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4721.16s)]
*  And, you know, part of what I liked about being in the CIA was that it gave you an [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4724.44s)]
*  opportunity to be able to go out and find out what are these countries and interest [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4729.8s)]
*  groups really think about us. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4734.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4736.16s)]
*  And, you know, often, you know, people didn't want to hear what you had to say [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4736.8s)]
*  because you want to believe that, okay, this policy that we're pursuing is either, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4740.4s)]
*  at least if not popular with country acts, is at least accepted by its leadership. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4745.839999999999s)]
*  And in many cases, that's simply not true. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4751.4s)]
*  Now, many times in these countries where they're powerless to do anything about it. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4753.44s)]
*  You know, it was something they disliked, but it wasn't going to have a negative [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4757.28s)]
*  impact, meaningful impact on their relationship with the United States. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4762.16s)]
*  But generally speaking, I would say that Americans don't have a great understanding [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4767.76s)]
*  of how the rest of the world works. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4775.16s)]
*  I mean, we're a huge country. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4777.16s)]
*  You know, you don't have to engage with foreigners a lot. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4778.88s)]
*  You don't have to, I mean, you can travel, but it's touristic. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4781.96s)]
*  If you don't speak the language, there's a lot of things you don't pick up. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4785.16s)]
*  You know, part of what and why having a security service or an intel service is [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4789.320000000001s)]
*  critical and frankly, also a foreign service, the State Department that's good at its [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4793.48s)]
*  job, is you need people who know what the reality on the ground is in these countries. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4797.2s)]
*  So that despite whatever the popular narrative is, that at least the American [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4803.759999999999s)]
*  leadership is informed. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4809.639999999999s)]
*  Here's what these guys really think about subject X. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4811.759999999999s)]
*  And if we pursue subject X further, it's likely to have results that we can't stop or [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4815.48s)]
*  we're going to have to stop at an elevated cost to ourselves and our own interests. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4822.08s)]
*  But you would bring that information back and you would get supervisors just weren't [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4827.64s)]
*  not that interested in hearing it. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4832.0s)]
*  So I would say generally within the CIA, you know, you've got a fair hearing about [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4834.24s)]
*  what it is you collected. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4840.08s)]
*  Now, whether or not the policymakers who consume the information the CIA produces, [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4841.04s)]
*  whether or not they believe it or they believe it's significant or they believe it's [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4848.0s)]
*  outweighed or not outweighed by other information they have access to, that was really [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4852.56s)]
*  up to them. I'd say something that has changed in the last 20 years that makes this [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4857.160000000001s)]
*  much harder is the rise of instantaneous information through the Internet. [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4863.64s)]
*  You know, the handheld device, you know, that everybody's got were in the past, the [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4869.200000000001s)]
*  security services, I think even globally, the IC in the United States, if they didn't [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4876.24s)]
*  have a monopoly on foreign information, they certainly had a large, hard to challenge [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4882.0s)]
*  degree of access that nobody else did. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4893.0s)]
*  What often I think happens now, and we've seen glimpses of this, you know, even come [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4897.28s)]
*  out in the media, is you have senior leaders of countries and senior leaders in the U.S. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4901.639999999999s)]
*  who, yes, they will consume that president's daily brief that's produced every morning, [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4907.16s)]
*  but they've also got contacts around the world who send them an email or send them a [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4912.5199999999995s)]
*  video. And I remember several bizarre instances in the early days of the Ukraine [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4916.12s)]
*  War where people were commenting on videos purportedly coming out of Ukraine that were [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4924.24s)]
*  actually clips from video games. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4931.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4934.5199999999995s)]
*  And, you know, in some cases, these were, you know, senior people or senior former [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4935.5199999999995s)]
*  people who who just didn't realize that, you know, this wasn't what it purported to [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4940.879999999999s)]
*  be. And now that you've got... [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4948.04s)]
*  Well, they're lying. I mean, I don't understand. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4948.799999999999s)]
*  So Russia has a hundred million more people than Ukraine in much deeper industrial [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4950.639999999999s)]
*  capacity. And nationalism, which actually matters in war. [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4954.84s)]
*  And so, like, there was never a chance, I think any objective person would say that [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4961.360000000001s)]
*  Ukraine was going to, like, crush Russia, which was I just don't think it was going [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4966.96s)]
*  to happen. And it hasn't happened. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4970.84s)]
*  But you saw all these Intel adjacent people or members of Congress who've been briefed, [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4972.56s)]
*  you know, repeatedly by the IC say, you know, tell you that with a straight face. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4976.88s)]
*  And so, like, where's the breakdown in information there? [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4983.44s)]
*  Well, members of Congress are getting honest briefings. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4988.679999999999s)]
*  They're going to have a clearer sense of the reality than they seem to have. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4990.84s)]
*  Like, what is that? So, you know, I think. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=4996.2s)]
*  I mean, Ukraine's instructive on a couple of levels. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5001.92s)]
*  You know, one, if you think the 2003 invasion of Iraq was. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5004.4s)]
*  Mishandled by the American Intel community, and it was the information on that. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5010.24s)]
*  Think about being the intelligence guys who told Putin that it would be a walkover to [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5015.24s)]
*  get into Ukraine. Because, you know, all indications are he was told we'll be in Kiev [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5019.719999999999s)]
*  in a week and, you know, we will be able to, you know, within a few months, be able to [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5026.48s)]
*  reimpose some type of government in this country that's more to our liking. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5031.36s)]
*  And clearly, you know, the Ukrainians who have their own political views, they're [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5036.2s)]
*  the Ukrainians who have their own nationalism, and it's been, I think, deepened by, you [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5039.72s)]
*  know, the violence of this war. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5044.12s)]
*  I mean, they've they've really pushed back. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5046.400000000001s)]
*  And it's bizarrely, Vladimir Putin has helped create more of a Ukrainian national [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5048.4400000000005s)]
*  identity than almost any other Ukrainian politicians ever done. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5053.360000000001s)]
*  People can unite against a common foe. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5057.08s)]
*  You know, as to the long term consequences. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5060.96s)]
*  Can I say? Sure. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5063.200000000001s)]
*  But it's not. I think I think what you said is fair. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5064.64s)]
*  But it's only one of the Intel failures. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5067.5199999999995s)]
*  If you're the Biden administration and you send your vice president over to Europe to [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5069.72s)]
*  encourage in public Zelensky to join NATO. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5073.599999999999s)]
*  What happened to Bill Burns, who wrote the famous memo, now runs CIA, said, if you do [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5078.16s)]
*  this, Russia will go to war. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5083.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, it's existential for them. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5086.44s)]
*  Yep. You can't put NATO on their borders. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5087.92s)]
*  Where is the Intel briefer who puts that in the PDP? [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5091.04s)]
*  Like, don't if you do this, you should know there's a nonzero risk of nuclear war. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5094.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5099.6s)]
*  But where was that guy? [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5100.280000000001s)]
*  And we certainly just we don't know, because, you know, currently, I'd assume the current [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5101.240000000001s)]
*  administration is not interested in, you know, providing it. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5107.0s)]
*  What would they call it? Track B analysis, you know, an altered analysis. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5110.64s)]
*  How about casualty numbers? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5113.200000000001s)]
*  I can't find a member of Congress, most of whom, you know, probably don't want to know. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5114.52s)]
*  But just give us a straight answer. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5119.88s)]
*  How many Ukrainians have died? [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5120.88s)]
*  Well, we don't know that. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5122.52s)]
*  Really? You get these briefs all the time in your little skiffs going through your little [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5123.5599999999995s)]
*  bullshit kabuki. And you can't tell me how many Ukrainians have died. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5127.16s)]
*  You sent them to your desk with this money and you can't tell me how many died. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5129.719999999999s)]
*  No, no one's ever mentioned that. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5132.84s)]
*  Like, what is that? [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5135.04s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's clearly a knowable fact. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5136.92s)]
*  Yeah, well, yeah. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5138.84s)]
*  And, you know, whether or not, you know, they were briefed on it, you know, they [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5139.719999999999s)]
*  chose not to talk about it or where they've never been briefed on it. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5143.639999999999s)]
*  I personally don't know. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5146.92s)]
*  I mean, I think based on public comments from the incoming administration, you know, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5149.0s)]
*  I think they've got a very different plan about how to try to bring this terrible, [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5155.879999999999s)]
*  horrible conflict to some sort of a resolution. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5160.96s)]
*  I sure hope so. I hope so. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5163.719999999999s)]
*  But I just think as you're prosecuting the war and paying for the war and your weapons [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5166.24s)]
*  and your advisers are making the war possible, whatever you think about the morality of [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5172.2s)]
*  the war or its cause or whatever, but you're definitely driving the war one side of it. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5175.96s)]
*  Don't you have an obligation to know how many of these people are dying? [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5180.36s)]
*  Like, I just don't understand that. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5184.4s)]
*  I mean, I can only say that were I advising somebody who was on the oversight, I would [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5185.72s)]
*  say that you have a very broad writ to be able to ask anything that you want to ask. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5190.52s)]
*  And I would think that, you know, nobody in the IC, if asked, would say anything to [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5198.52s)]
*  them other than, OK, here's what we know. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5204.0s)]
*  Now, maybe they don't know or maybe they haven't gone out and collected it. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5205.44s)]
*  But in the case of, you know, casualties in Ukraine, I'd be surprised if a congressman [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5209.16s)]
*  really wanted to know that, that they couldn't get that answer or force the system to give [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5216.759999999999s)]
*  it to them. And if the system didn't, then that's a problem. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5221.24s)]
*  That's a problem. I just would think that would be like one of those baseline numbers, [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5224.759999999999s)]
*  like there's one of those Wikipedia numbers that just like these are like facts that you [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5229.5599999999995s)]
*  should know. Like, what are the casualty numbers? [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5233.44s)]
*  And by the way, everyone has an incentive to lie about them always in every conflict. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5235.32s)]
*  And both sides are lying about them. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5239.679999999999s)]
*  I get that. But my impression was the intelligence agencies are supposed to be like [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5241.24s)]
*  purveyors of reliable information. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5246.32s)]
*  Again, I would imagine that they must have a pretty darn good idea. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5248.48s)]
*  Do you know what those numbers are? [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5252.5599999999995s)]
*  I've heard various ones. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5254.679999999999s)]
*  I have to. So, you know, I've heard. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5255.879999999999s)]
*  On the very low side, I've heard something like 50,000 Ukrainian dead. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5258.08s)]
*  I don't believe that one. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5261.4s)]
*  I think it's probably more like 120 to 150 dead. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5263.0s)]
*  I think Russian maybe half again that if not double. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5269.24s)]
*  I think one of the things that you know, you see when you go to Ukraine is an astounding [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5274.68s)]
*  number of people with traumatic amputations and grievous injuries. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5279.2s)]
*  And those, you know, all these are indicators of just how bad this conflict really is. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5285.2s)]
*  And how and how how it's ground up so many young lives. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5294.56s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I don't. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5300.4s)]
*  I agree with that. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5302.36s)]
*  Is the president's daily brief written in a way to influence the president? [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5305.4800000000005s)]
*  Written in a way to influence the president one way or the other. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5311.599999999999s)]
*  It's not supposed to be. And it's supposed to be the job of whoever is the director of [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5316.2s)]
*  national intelligence to, you know, to the degree, you know, humanly possible to. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5319.5599999999995s)]
*  Not put a heavy editorial slant on it. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5326.8s)]
*  You know, whether they achieve that in everything, you know, it's human enterprise. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5329.96s)]
*  I'm sure there are instances when it doesn't. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5333.84s)]
*  But maybe that's why they don't want Tulsi Gabbard in there. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5335.8s)]
*  I think there seem to be a lot of reasons why they, you know, they're uncomfortable [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5341.2s)]
*  with somebody who doesn't accept the foreign policy consensus. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5344.4s)]
*  And, you know, since I wrote that article endorsing her, you know, I've had people I [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5347.2s)]
*  know, people I like, you know, say that, you know, why, you know, why her? [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5352.96s)]
*  And I've had a lot more actually also reach out and say, we agree with you, you know, [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5357.04s)]
*  somebody who's going to be skeptical and challenge the assumptions that we, you know, [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5362.5599999999995s)]
*  we far or were too easily willing to continue to traffic in. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5367.36s)]
*  You know, it's we can afford to have a couple of skeptics around. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5373.4s)]
*  How many moments during your 28 year career, did you have moral qualms with what you [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5377.72s)]
*  were asked to do? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5382.44s)]
*  I did not have a moral qualm with anything that I was asked to do. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5384.16s)]
*  You know, some of the things you get asked to do are hard. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5388.8s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5391.2s)]
*  You know, probably. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5392.0s)]
*  You know, I'd say in a, in a war situation and I'll, I'll expand this beyond myself. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5397.12s)]
*  You, you could find yourself in situations where, you know, you might be supporting one [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5403.68s)]
*  side or another in a conflict. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5409.0s)]
*  And it becomes the policy of your country that it's no longer going to support either [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5412.0s)]
*  side or it's going to withdraw support. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5415.400000000001s)]
*  You know, that, that can be a very bad thing to experience. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5418.16s)]
*  Where, you know, you've got to deliver a message that says, I know we were supporting [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5421.68s)]
*  you before and we've been doing that for some time. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5427.200000000001s)]
*  Priorities have changed and we're not going to support you. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5432.0s)]
*  Now that's completely within the lawful authority of the director of the CIA, the [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5435.360000000001s)]
*  national security council and the president. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5441.72s)]
*  It doesn't make it easy to do that. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5444.56s)]
*  Um, but did I have, you know, you know, was ever asked to do anything where I said, you [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5446.5599999999995s)]
*  know, that's completely outrageous or immoral? [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5452.2s)]
*  No, but, you know, maybe, maybe they save those questions for somebody else. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5456.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5460.2s)]
*  Um, but, you know, in my case, you know, I took a pretty aggressive stand or view [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5460.4s)]
*  towards what America's role in the world should be, you know, uh, like a lot of other [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5465.72s)]
*  folks, you know, who went to war zones. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5470.92s)]
*  You know, now we don't equate what we do to what combat soldiers do, but, you know, [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5473.4800000000005s)]
*  you've got to make decisions sometimes that affect life. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5478.12s)]
*  I think the first casualty in the war in Afghanistan was a CIA officer. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5480.32s)]
*  It was Mike Spann. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5484.4800000000005s)]
*  Mike Spann, who was killed, you know, early on. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5485.92s)]
*  So yes, I did not. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5488.400000000001s)]
*  I did not. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5490.400000000001s)]
*  I knew, you know, other members of his team. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5490.92s)]
*  And I remember the night when he was killed in Kalijongi prison, uh, you know, when a [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5493.12s)]
*  cop, you know, when a prisoner riot happened. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5497.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5500.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5501.0s)]
*  It's a job that has elevated risk, especially if you are overseas, you're in conflict zones. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5501.24s)]
*  You know, sometimes, you know, it's hostile action. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5508.08s)]
*  Sometimes it's bad luck. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5510.0s)]
*  You know, you're, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5511.839999999999s)]
*  You know, something falls out of the sky and it gets too close to you and you're, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5514.44s)]
*  you know, you're injured or killed. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5518.08s)]
*  But it was a great career, you know, for a young person who's interested in the world, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5522.0s)]
*  who sort of wants to challenge themselves and is willing to make a sacrifice. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5526.64s)]
*  You know, if you can keep your ethics while you're doing it, you know, there's [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5531.04s)]
*  nothing else like it in the world, in my experience. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5534.44s)]
*  I believe that a lot of divorce. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5537.16s)]
*  I've known a lot of case officers are almost all divorced. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5539.8s)]
*  Uh, those types of careers, sort of like some of the career. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5542.8s)]
*  Is that a fair thing to it? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5545.8s)]
*  It's, it's, and you know, it's heavily skewed towards, you know, case officers [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5546.96s)]
*  and people who have multiple assignments overseas. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5551.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5553.92s)]
*  I'm not talking with the analysts at home. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5554.16s)]
*  Uh, yeah, I'd say, you know, similar to the joint special operations command, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5555.44s)]
*  JSOC, uh, which are, you know, Delta Force, Navy SEALs. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5560.08s)]
*  Uh, yeah, you get, you have enormous stresses on families. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5564.4s)]
*  You, you, to do this type of job and to really love it and to want to do it, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5570.12s)]
*  you really got to be willing to sacrifice. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5574.679999999999s)]
*  And that's something that they don't, they will tell you this when you first [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5576.839999999999s)]
*  join, you know, what's the old joke? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5580.24s)]
*  What, what do young people really know about certain things, you know, and as [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5583.08s)]
*  you matriculate through your career, you'll realize that, okay, you're going [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5587.28s)]
*  to need to give this up and this thing might be important to you personally. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5591.96s)]
*  You're maybe you're not going to go to that assignment that you wanted to go [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5595.92s)]
*  to because they're redirecting you to some other crisis that, you know, you [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5598.84s)]
*  were never interested in having anything to do with, but you, you joined to serve [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5602.76s)]
*  at the leisure of your directors and your bosses. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5610.400000000001s)]
*  And I, in my case, I never turned down an assignment, you know, even though, [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5614.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, I re-tallied it up once of all the places I ever went, I never actually [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5619.4800000000005s)]
*  asked to go to any of them. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5623.12s)]
*  I was just told, like, we know you put down, you wanted to go to some nice place [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5624.92s)]
*  in Europe, somebody will just tell you, well, back to wherever you're going again. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5630.28s)]
*  What's the worst post you had? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5636.24s)]
*  So, you know, Sudan and Africa was pretty, pretty dicey and a pretty interesting [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5637.32s)]
*  place in the early nineties. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5646.5199999999995s)]
*  You know, you know, there's no cell phones. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5650.28s)]
*  Um, it's, you know, it was a hotbed of bad guy terrorism back in those days. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5653.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, Osama Bin Laden was literally driving around Khartoum and a [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5661.5199999999995s)]
*  Toyota Hilux pickup truck. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5665.76s)]
*  Um, the government of Sudan was highly radicalized and had literally an open [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5667.84s)]
*  door, um, open door policy towards almost every bad guy organization on planet [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5674.64s)]
*  Earth, um, which led to some very peculiar situations where they would, I remember [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5679.92s)]
*  that one point they had a meeting at the Khartoum Hilton Hotel, which is near the [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5686.76s)]
*  Nile river. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5691.0s)]
*  And it was literally a conference for every jihadist group on planet Earth. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5692.280000000001s)]
*  So the jihadists prefer Hilton. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5697.400000000001s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5700.12s)]
*  You know, it seems they had good discounts. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5700.64s)]
*  They had, you know, and if you're going to have non-alcoholic drinks, you know, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5704.240000000001s)]
*  super sugary, they had some pretty nice offerings. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5706.88s)]
*  Um, but you know, you know, it was a different world on terrorism prior to [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5709.8s)]
*  9 11. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5714.76s)]
*  I mean, the Sudanese government in those days, quite literally, and this is not an [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5715.84s)]
*  exaggeration, advertised a conference. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5720.08s)]
*  It was in December of 1993. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5725.08s)]
*  Come to Khartoum. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5727.48s)]
*  We're going to be hosting everybody at the Khartoum Hilton. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5729.32s)]
*  Bring, if you want to bring Hamas, bring Hezbollah, bring Islamic jihad, bring [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5732.24s)]
*  the IRGC, bring far flung terrorists, other groups that, you know, almost no one [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5737.84s)]
*  else has ever heard of. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5746.88s)]
*  And these people showed up for two days, you know, to talk about, you know, sort [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5748.64s)]
*  of the unfair American hegemony that, you know, they felt had been imposed upon [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5753.84s)]
*  the world. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5760.72s)]
*  Did you go to the conference? [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5761.280000000001s)]
*  I did. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5763.400000000001s)]
*  So, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5764.200000000001s)]
*  it was, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5766.6s)]
*  what'd you put on your name badge? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5767.04s)]
*  Uh, I should have put like Swiss delegation or something, but I actually, I [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5768.88s)]
*  remember I was sitting next to, again, the government at the time in Sudan, [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5772.4800000000005s)]
*  was proud of this. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5778.08s)]
*  They thought it was important. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5779.08s)]
*  It was their way to establish a role for themselves. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5780.320000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I was a young guy, I was like 26 years old. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5783.76s)]
*  And I wound up in this conference hall where the opening chant is the army of [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5789.400000000001s)]
*  the prophet is against the Jew. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5795.92s)]
*  So that goes on for a couple of minutes to get the crowd going. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5798.360000000001s)]
*  Uh, and again, you know, I'm there not to advocate for what these people do. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5801.56s)]
*  I'm there to try to figure out who they are and what they're up to. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5804.76s)]
*  And if they want to invite me to their extremist event, because they're proud. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5807.4s)]
*  Why would they invite a lot of CIA officers? [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5812.0s)]
*  Uh, well, I don't think, we didn't put that on our name card, but it was, um, [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5814.48s)]
*  they were okay with foreign embassies that were accredited to their country [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5820.16s)]
*  showing up. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5824.5599999999995s)]
*  And so I remember I was sitting- [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5826.2s)]
*  You went as a US embassy employee. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5827.639999999999s)]
*  I was the only US embassy person dumb enough to go to this thing. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5829.0s)]
*  And the guy sitting beside me was the Swiss ChargÃ©. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5832.639999999999s)]
*  And very nice guy. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5837.28s)]
*  ChargÃ© de Ferre is the number two guy in the Swiss embassy. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5839.68s)]
*  Uh, and Switzerland, cause the Red Cross had a fairly big presence there. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5844.4s)]
*  And when this number starts with the opening chant, we, he and I've been sort [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5850.32s)]
*  of small talking and he just said, I'll never forget this. [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5855.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, my dear boy. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5859.0s)]
*  I hope you will understand. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5860.12s)]
*  I'm going to go away from you now. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5861.4s)]
*  That's all right. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5863.88s)]
*  You know, and that was because, you know, it was like, you know, death to [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5864.48s)]
*  America was always the second chant. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5869.639999999999s)]
*  After that. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5872.639999999999s)]
*  And again, the peculiar thing about it was despite all that hostility, you'd [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5873.24s)]
*  actually get Sudanese who are congenitally very friendly people, even [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5879.24s)]
*  their kind of extremist government. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5884.879999999999s)]
*  It come up and ask you afterwards, like, you know, during a break, are [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5887.12s)]
*  you having an okay time? [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5889.959999999999s)]
*  You're getting, are you getting, you know, a cool drink, you know, it's a [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5890.96s)]
*  little hot, even though it's December. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5894.8s)]
*  I'm like, I'm good. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5896.36s)]
*  So, you know, it was, it was a very different world on terrorism. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5898.16s)]
*  You know, these groups could operate fairly openly and, you know, there just [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5902.88s)]
*  wasn't a Western response like there was after 9-11 and I know I've had [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5907.56s)]
*  friends of mine tell me like that can't possibly be a true story. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5911.56s)]
*  I'm like, you can look it up on the internet, you know, not what I just [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5914.4s)]
*  said, but that they actually had a conference like this. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5918.2s)]
*  They had even Sunni and Shia groups at the same, at the same thing, same event. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5922.0s)]
*  Ecumenical terrorist group. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5928.639999999999s)]
*  It was the most ecumenical group of bad guys you'd ever meet. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5929.72s)]
*  So what's the story with the drones over the United States in December? [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5934.16s)]
*  There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of unconfirmed, but citizen [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5937.679999999999s)]
*  reports of drones over in New York, New Jersey, Mid-Atlantic, Pennsylvania. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5942.44s)]
*  Um, at night with lights. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5946.8s)]
*  Yep. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5949.16s)]
*  So why would drones be flying with lights at night? [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5949.64s)]
*  So I think this is a, I think from what I've looked into and what I've talked [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5953.4s)]
*  to people who I think know something about this, that there's no foreign [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5958.64s)]
*  threat here, this isn't any kind of hostile action, but it absolutely points [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5962.6s)]
*  out some longer, some immediate problems that the United States has. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5967.84s)]
*  Can we begin with what it was? [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5972.16s)]
*  So what it appears to be is, you know, people were saying that I'm seeing [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5973.36s)]
*  what I believe to be a drone in the sky in the evening hours. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5978.28s)]
*  Now what it appears to have been going on is there were some fair amount of [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5982.2s)]
*  misidentification of, you know, manned aircraft or other things that people [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5986.76s)]
*  would report, Hey, I think this is a drone. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5991.28s)]
*  In other cases, you know, the federal aviation administration, which controls [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5994.2s)]
*  the U S airspace had in the last year, I believe, changed the rules that said [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=5999.56s)]
*  you could now operate a drone at night under certain conditions, if you put [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6005.56s)]
*  lights on it. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6010.040000000001s)]
*  So it appears that at least some of what people were seeing were people who were [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6011.360000000001s)]
*  lawfully accessing the airspace with their private drone, most of time are [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6016.72s)]
*  probably hobbyist drones, um, that people are kind of seeing things up in the sky [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6021.120000000001s)]
*  that they wouldn't have seen before. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6026.84s)]
*  What was really peculiar about this was the sort of fumbled response from the [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6028.2s)]
*  nation. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6033.639999999999s)]
*  So you're saying it was nothing. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6033.72s)]
*  I believe, and I have no evidence that this was an Iranian mothership, that [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6035.4s)]
*  there were, you know, some kind of government, um, sensitive government [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6040.08s)]
*  operation or testing. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6045.28s)]
*  I mean, the government has plenty of other places to test drones. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6048.32s)]
*  And if you're going to test out military drones doing sensitive missions, [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6052.16s)]
*  you're not going to bother to put lights on them. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6056.12s)]
*  Well, of course. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6057.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6058.04s)]
*  And in Ukraine, you know, where they've been using like a million, literally a [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6058.12s)]
*  million drones a year, you know, nobody puts lights on their drones. [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6061.36s)]
*  So if you're a hostile actor, you don't do that. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6064.799999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6067.12s)]
*  But what this has pointed out is there's really not a unified plan in the United [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6068.16s)]
*  States. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6072.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, right. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6073.759999999999s)]
*  And, you know, the more paranoid among us like me might say that like a unified [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6074.839999999999s)]
*  plan, you know, not all unified plans are great, but can we just go back to just [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6079.96s)]
*  the pause? [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6083.2s)]
*  So you think every, you know, the scores, hundreds of videos of lighted drones or [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6083.72s)]
*  things, lights in the sky at low altitude hovering, those were all hobbyist [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6090.12s)]
*  drones with lights on them. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6094.88s)]
*  I mean, some of them could be, you know, there are in the commercial drone world, [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6096.72s)]
*  there are drones that are, you know, that people use for commercial purposes, [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6100.72s)]
*  most of photography. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6105.28s)]
*  Um, I would say that I have become a bit of a fan of the commercial drone [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6106.4s)]
*  industry. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6112.16s)]
*  I would say that I have become suspicious over the last couple of years in [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6112.76s)]
*  believing things that I see on videos. [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6118.0s)]
*  Just because so many of them are, you know, you don't know the [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6120.5599999999995s)]
*  Provence of them. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6123.599999999999s)]
*  I'm in the news. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6124.88s)]
*  But I can promise you, suspicion is warranted. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6125.68s)]
*  However, there's so many of them that I've just, I'm just interested. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6128.32s)]
*  I mean, I don't know what they were, but I personally believe, you know, that [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6131.84s)]
*  these were hobbyist drones or misidentification of other types of aircraft. [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6136.639999999999s)]
*  Planes. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6141.04s)]
*  You know, um, helicopter, you know, something else that's authorized to be [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6141.6s)]
*  there, that's flying, but boy, the government could have really made this [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6147.200000000001s)]
*  much easier on everybody if they just said, we're going to take three simple, [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6153.280000000001s)]
*  easy steps to resolve this. [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6158.0s)]
*  You know, one will explain who's actually responsible for the airspace. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6160.64s)]
*  Cause there really isn't an easy to understand plan on that too. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6165.120000000001s)]
*  They could put up a few government drones of their own to go look and try [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6169.68s)]
*  to see who's up there. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6173.68s)]
*  Third, they have plenty of detection gear that you could use in a civilian [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6175.4400000000005s)]
*  area to determine if there's actually a drone up there because drones have to [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6179.92s)]
*  have a radio connection between the operator and the person flying it. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6184.88s)]
*  It's understandable and well known what those frequencies are. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6191.36s)]
*  That type of equipment is available to the government. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6195.12s)]
*  They could have within a few days. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6197.76s)]
*  It's available to the civilian. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6198.96s)]
*  Yeah, it's available to civilians and you know, the government could have [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6200.08s)]
*  easily gotten, you know, made people, could have calmed the situation down. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6202.8s)]
*  But they didn't and it went on for over a month and the internet was just [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6206.88s)]
*  crowded with these videos. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6211.12s)]
*  His stereo was rising and not only did the government not make at all levels, [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6213.599999999999s)]
*  the state of New Jersey, state of New York, and then of course the, the [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6217.28s)]
*  Biden administration made no effort to calm people down at all and said [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6221.5199999999995s)]
*  contradictory weird things, some of which were clearly untrue, but it was [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6225.44s)]
*  unclear what was true. [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6229.12s)]
*  I mean, it just seemed like if you wanted to calm people down, it's the [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6232.08s)]
*  opposite of what you would have done. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6235.599999999999s)]
*  I got the sense that they just didn't take people's concerns seriously. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6237.599999999999s)]
*  Again, but you know, I work in the drone industry. [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6242.24s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6244.5599999999995s)]
*  And so, you know, from everybody I've talked to who I think is, you know, [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6244.96s)]
*  credible and thoughtful on this, none of them believe that this was some sort [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6249.5199999999995s)]
*  of nefarious thing. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6253.68s)]
*  That it was a government operation. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6255.4400000000005s)]
*  That it was like, you know, that they were looking, what was one of the [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6257.04s)]
*  stories I heard, that they were looking for, you know, lost nuclear materials in [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6259.280000000001s)]
*  Jersey. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6263.04s)]
*  As a friend of mine said, how could you tell, you know, with everything else [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6265.4400000000005s)]
*  in Jersey, you know, fair question. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6267.76s)]
*  But that's not really how you would look for lost nuclear material anyway. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6271.360000000001s)]
*  And I think what happens in the absence of the government providing some kind [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6275.6s)]
*  of an answer, the void has to be filled by something. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6280.48s)]
*  I'm willing to believe, I mean, I don't know the answer, as I've said, but I'm [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6288.16s)]
*  certainly willing to believe everything that you have said. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6292.0s)]
*  What I am hung up on is the government response, because at best it betrays, at [[01:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6294.16s)]
*  worst it betrays some sort of sinister plan to make people more paranoid, which is [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6300.4s)]
*  not inconceivable. [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6304.16s)]
*  But at best, it's suggested it's don't care at all what the public thinks [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6305.679999999999s)]
*  about anything. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6309.2s)]
*  And that's a very bad attitude that should be punishable by jail time. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6310.48s)]
*  In my opinion, that's anti-democratic. [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6313.679999999999s)]
*  We don't care. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6316.24s)]
*  I'll put it this way, you know, I and other folks I know in that industry are all [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6317.839999999999s)]
*  of a single mind that they could, you could easily know what this was and you [[01:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6324.48s)]
*  can make, you know, definitive statements about it with a little bit of [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6327.919999999999s)]
*  investigation. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6331.04s)]
*  I think they just didn't take the concern seriously. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6332.639999999999s)]
*  And when they did try to look into how to do this, they realized that they have a [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6337.76s)]
*  mishmash of authorities. [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6342.32s)]
*  So just as a very simple one, people don't realize that there's no legal [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6344.24s)]
*  authority to knock a drone out of the sky outside of a very few narrow use cases [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6348.72s)]
*  that only the government has and not all the government only. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6355.52s)]
*  I didn't understand, like as a bird hunter, I mean, I would, if I would [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6358.8s)]
*  immediately shoot a drone down over my house. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6362.56s)]
*  I wouldn't even think about it. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6364.24s)]
*  Why did nobody do that? [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6365.2s)]
*  What a nation of... [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6366.16s)]
*  Maybe that's why we had this story in New Jersey and not Texas. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6368.96s)]
*  Fair point. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6374.639999999999s)]
*  I remember when I understood there really is no authority to knock a drone [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6379.76s)]
*  out of the sky. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6383.76s)]
*  And in fact, if someone was to shotgun somebody's drone out of the sky, the FAA [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6384.24s)]
*  on paper could actually charge you with interfere, literally interfering with an [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6389.36s)]
*  aircraft in flight, which is a rule that was designed to keep manned aircraft and [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6394.08s)]
*  crude aircraft safe. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6400.08s)]
*  But that law still covers anything that flies. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6402.16s)]
*  And so you are at some legal jeopardy if the government chose to prosecute a [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6406.08s)]
*  person for taking your AR-15 and knocking a drone out. [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6410.96s)]
*  That'd be a very good shot. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6417.84s)]
*  That would be a very good shot. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6419.2s)]
*  Maybe they had the lights on. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6420.8s)]
*  It makes it a little bit... [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6421.68s)]
*  But with a tightly choked 28 gauge, you could definitely bring it down. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6422.4s)]
*  So I was not surprised when some immediate member of Congress claimed it was from the [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6426.48s)]
*  Iranian mothership because they want to war with Iran because they're paid to [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6429.839999999999s)]
*  want to war with Iran. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6432.639999999999s)]
*  This is my view. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6433.599999999999s)]
*  And they blame everything on Iran, which clearly doesn't want to war with the [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6435.839999999999s)]
*  United States, but whatever. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6438.32s)]
*  But it does raise the question, could a hostile nation park a ship offshore and [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6439.92s)]
*  attack us with drones? [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6445.2s)]
*  Yes, they could. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6446.4s)]
*  There's currently very little defense in the United States. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6448.0s)]
*  Against a deliberate use of drones against any major target. [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6453.12s)]
*  And that's, you know, so we, you know, take a look at the situation in Ukraine [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6459.679999999999s)]
*  where they've now literally think last year, Ukraine used 1.4 million drones. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6463.92s)]
*  That's the population. [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6469.679999999999s)]
*  That's almost the population. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6471.28s)]
*  I think of like San Antonio, Texas, one drone per person, but they used small [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6472.4s)]
*  attack drones, 1.4 million of them. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6478.08s)]
*  That's not including the... [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6480.48s)]
*  When you say attack drones, what are those drones capable of doing? [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6481.12s)]
*  What do they do? [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6483.2s)]
*  So those drones would be about as big as, you know, two big boilers that you [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6484.0s)]
*  might have in your house. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6490.4s)]
*  Could carry, you know, two, maybe two, three pounds of explosives, fly anywhere [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6491.76s)]
*  from eight to 15, 20 kilometers, 11 to 15 miles, something like that, and be [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6497.5199999999995s)]
*  delivered precisely within inches of what you're trying to hit. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6505.44s)]
*  So if you were to look at some of these Ukraine war videos where people are [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6510.8s)]
*  literally driving drones through the hatch of a tank from miles away, [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6514.48s)]
*  that's absolutely happening right now. [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6521.04s)]
*  In addition to that, you know, people have developed drones that can fly a [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6525.5199999999995s)]
*  thousand kilometers and hit a target within inches. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6528.96s)]
*  Ukrainians have actually taken out very expensive, hard to replace [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6533.76s)]
*  reduction strategic bombers that were on an airfield that would be very hard to [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6537.92s)]
*  hit in flight. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6542.4800000000005s)]
*  But they decided, you know what, we're not going to wait for that airplane to [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6543.84s)]
*  go into flight. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6546.08s)]
*  We're going to hit it on the ground where it's extremely vulnerable. [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6547.2s)]
*  That could easily happen in the United States. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6550.32s)]
*  There is no comprehensive protection against small drones. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6552.96s)]
*  The US air defense was created around the concept that we're trying to stop [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6559.2s)]
*  either Scud missile type threats. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6564.16s)]
*  Yes. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6566.8s)]
*  Or manned aircraft. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6567.2s)]
*  I'll give you a good, you know, fairly tight scenario. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6570.16s)]
*  So the Patriot missile, which is, you know, America's preeminent air defense [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6574.24s)]
*  system that's deployed all over the world. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6580.08s)]
*  It's got something like 36 missiles in it. [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6582.8s)]
*  It costs quite a bit of money to have one of those systems. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6586.8s)]
*  You can quite literally overwhelm all of that, all of its defensive systems [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6591.599999999999s)]
*  with 30 or 40 cheap drones. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6596.8s)]
*  It would cost you less than a hundred thousand dollars. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6598.48s)]
*  And the operators of that defensive system would have to expend all of their missiles [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6603.76s)]
*  because they'd see this threat coming and they shoot, you know, at least one [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6611.04s)]
*  rocket per target. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6613.599999999999s)]
*  And then they're down to zero. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6616.32s)]
*  That's sort of kind of what you've been seeing on the Red Sea recently. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6618.4s)]
*  Yes. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6622.16s)]
*  Between the US Navy and the Houthi militant movement. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6622.4s)]
*  Where the US is spending millions of dollars per missile strike to take out a $10,000 drone. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6625.76s)]
*  You know, the math is unsustainable. [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6634.0s)]
*  And so the US, like most countries in the West, are very vulnerable to this issue right now. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6637.52s)]
*  I mean, when air power is no longer tied to airfields and it doesn't need a pilot, [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6644.400000000001s)]
*  you know, you've democratized air power in a way that's very discomforting to Americans. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6650.4s)]
*  I mean, I assume there are drones with like big payload capacities now. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6656.16s)]
*  There are. [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6661.04s)]
*  So, you know, when you think about, you know, sort of the drones of the global war on terrorism, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6661.759999999999s)]
*  the Predators, the Reapers, these are proper aircraft. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6667.2s)]
*  You know, they're large, but they're also very easily seen on radar and they're expensive. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6670.5599999999995s)]
*  They can cost, you know, tens of millions of dollars to some of them. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6675.76s)]
*  Some of the big surveillance drones are $100 million worth of electronics and equipment. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6680.56s)]
*  But we've reached a world where, I mean, again, back to the Ukrainians, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6686.56s)]
*  they've been able to knock out, you know, $2 million, $3 million tanks with $1,000 drones [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6692.16s)]
*  because of the precision and the lack of defense that, you know, often the Russians have. [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6701.2s)]
*  And then you add into, you know, robotic, what we call military robotics, drones at sea, [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6707.04s)]
*  where, you know, it's increasingly possible, and the Ukrainians have done this as well, [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6714.5599999999995s)]
*  to use a $250,000 drone boat to sink a 50 or 60 or $100 million ship. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6719.599999999999s)]
*  The Ukrainians have physically been able to do that on the Black Sea. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6728.48s)]
*  You know, for a country like the United States, which really relies on a blue water Navy, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6733.36s)]
*  you know, we are very likely to face opponents who will be able to put up [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6739.44s)]
*  hundreds, if not thousands of drones at a time that would easily overwhelm, [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6744.24s)]
*  you know, the defense systems we've got. So if you ever go online and look at, [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6749.2s)]
*  I would call something called Chinese drone shows. This is where, you know, they'll have [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6754.0s)]
*  a Chinese company at some event in China or around the world where they sort of rent out [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6758.719999999999s)]
*  this capability, where they've got a dragon flying in the air. And maybe it's 4,000 drones [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6765.28s)]
*  or 5,000 drones that they've got up in the air that they are controlling all at one time [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6770.879999999999s)]
*  in some of these bigger shows. Four or 5,000 flying devices. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6775.36s)]
*  I've seen them. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6779.28s)]
*  What if they put a pound of explosive on each one of them and then fire them over a city [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6779.84s)]
*  or fired them at, you know, a sensitive military facility? That's well within reality. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6788.08s)]
*  And it's only going to get more acute in the coming years. And right now, you know, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6795.52s)]
*  the United States is still, despite some efforts, you know, that I'll give them some credit for on [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6800.96s)]
*  the Biden administration to try to look at this. We're woefully behind. Ukraine has got a far more [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6805.6s)]
*  sophisticated drone program than the U.S. does right now. And so does Russia. [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6812.0s)]
*  I mean, that just seems like criminal negligence. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6819.200000000001s)]
*  You know, I think a lot of it was, you know, the global war on terrorism [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6822.88s)]
*  favored very large aircraft. And so small drones were not really a thing for the U.S. military. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6828.08s)]
*  They were first used in warfare, I think, during that Iraq and Afghanistan. Is that not right? [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6834.32s)]
*  So at, you know, at scale, small drones? No. So, I mean, they just were not, you know, [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6840.48s)]
*  they weren't battlefield significant for quite a period of time. But I'll, you know, a quick fact, [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6847.28s)]
*  you know, I looked this up, up until about two years ago, I think 18 months ago, no U.S. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6854.24s)]
*  servicemen, no army, nobody in the army had been killed by an enemy airstrike since Korea. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6861.280000000001s)]
*  When that drone strike took place on the Jordanian-Syrian border against the U.S. military [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6869.280000000001s)]
*  base that I think killed four or six U.S. servicemen, it's the first time U.S. servicemen, [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6874.56s)]
*  army, army folks, had been killed by hostile air action in decades. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6880.48s)]
*  The U.S. 70 years. 70 years. So, I mean, the U.S., which has long relied on the fact that we [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6890.799999999999s)]
*  completely dominate the airspace, any future marine or army operation will have to factor in [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6897.28s)]
*  that there are cheap, large numbers of surveillance and strike aircraft that the enemy [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6905.76s)]
*  have access to that really change the calculus on how much risk we're taking. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6912.0s)]
*  Are micro drones likely to play a role, tiny swarms of, large swarms of tiny drones likely to [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6918.88s)]
*  play a role in future warfare? Absolutely. I mean, I would define tiny as probably, you know, [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6925.04s)]
*  something that can carry about a pound of explosives. You know, there's really two things [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6930.8s)]
*  you do with the drone. One, you use it for surveillance so you know where the enemy is. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6934.96s)]
*  Two, you use it as a weapon. And absolutely, there's no technical reason that in the next five or [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6940.08s)]
*  seven years that an average military unit might carry 10 or 15 small drones on it that don't cost [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6948.88s)]
*  an awful lot of money, but can go up and search out enemy vehicles, locations, fortifications, [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6957.44s)]
*  and strike them. I would also suggest that probably on a civilian level, and this is my speculation, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6963.839999999999s)]
*  within 10 to 15 years, your first engagement with law enforcement or the traffic stop [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6973.5199999999995s)]
*  will be with the drone. That, you know, instead of being pulled over by a cop who gets out and [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6978.48s)]
*  comes up and talks to you, that I suspect that it will be every cop car, every police car will [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6984.16s)]
*  actually have a small drone in it that they will be able to sort of send forward once they've got [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6991.76s)]
*  you at a stop. They'll have a camera in there, they'll have the ability to talk to you through it, [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=6996.08s)]
*  and that will be your encounter with law enforcement. And you already see that in some [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7001.68s)]
*  ways with, you know, cops using small drones to go into tactical situations and take a look around [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7007.12s)]
*  before sending an officer in. Yeah. I want to just give them nuclear weapons. I mean, [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7013.44s)]
*  right. So people are not thinking through the effect. I mean, when DOD started transferring [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7020.24s)]
*  hardware to police departments, I'm as pro-cop as anybody, but you could sort of see the end of [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7024.879999999999s)]
*  civil liberties right there. Yeah. I mean, on this one, you know, I mean, I think you're talking [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7030.08s)]
*  about the, I think it was at the end of maybe the Bush administration where there was a lot of [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7034.799999999999s)]
*  former mill kit that was made available. I mean, yeah. I mean, in this case, you know, [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7040.88s)]
*  I was just thinking of a civilian version of a police drone. I mean, your civil liberties question [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7046.96s)]
*  though is appropriate because what drones will allow someone to do is at extremely low cost [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7053.2s)]
*  to put complete blanket surveillance over any city they want to. Well, sure. This is why they don't [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7062.08s)]
*  care. So to answer your question, my question, and both of our questions, like, why didn't they [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7068.0s)]
*  care that people were afraid, you know, in the run up to Christmas in a sacred time, like people [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7071.92s)]
*  are anxious about these lights in the sky and no one in the government feels like I need to calm [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7078.0s)]
*  people down and, you know, explain this. Yeah. Because they're looking at a future where there's [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7082.24s)]
*  complete control of the population through technology. That's exactly. They don't have to [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7087.84s)]
*  care. And on this, you know, when people talk about, you know, civil liberties concern, this is an actual [[01:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7092.08s)]
*  one that I think technologically were already there. They could do it if they wanted to. Any [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7099.44s)]
*  country could. You could put a grid of drones over a major city and do two things. You could cover [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7105.84s)]
*  almost every square foot that's available from, you know, line of sight. And you could record [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7112.48s)]
*  and keep and store all that data for all time. There is no practical reason, technical barrier, [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7120.56s)]
*  to put a drone up over, let's say, you know, downtown Chicago [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7127.6s)]
*  and keep a drone on station there day in and day out for years and constantly build [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7134.72s)]
*  a body of video data on that neighborhood that could be stored for all time [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7142.08s)]
*  and would be available to the government or whoever has access to it. That's something that [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7149.12s)]
*  probably really does need to be addressed at some point. Sure. I mean, it may sooner rather than [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7155.36s)]
*  later, there may come a point where we sort of, I mean, I hate crime and I think criminals should [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7160.719999999999s)]
*  be punished. But we may sort of look back wistfully at a time when people were able to commit crimes [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7166.5599999999995s)]
*  because it's not possible anymore. Only the government can commit crimes. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7172.08s)]
*  Sorry to get dark on you. [[01:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7178.88s)]
*  It's all right. Yeah. I mean, you can build a time machine in the sky with these systems [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7180.08s)]
*  and you can store the data because it's super cheap to store data now. We're getting cheaper [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7184.5599999999995s)]
*  all the time. Well, you know, imagine, for example, you have a confirmation hearing [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7188.4s)]
*  25 years from now. And for 15 of those 20 years, we've been able to keep drones up over a city. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7195.92s)]
*  And we've got 15 years of data, you know, of people who were just going about their daily lives, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7204.8s)]
*  who later go on to, you know, go into politics. Who has access to that data? [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7212.64s)]
*  This is why I quit drinking. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7217.76s)]
*  That's why I never started. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7220.96s)]
*  Smart. Is anybody, I mean, you're obviously on the drone side of it. Do you work in the drone [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7223.36s)]
*  industry? But is anybody in on the regulatory side thinking about how to balance [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7231.12s)]
*  this technology? And it's, you know, amazing possibilities with [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7238.4s)]
*  people's right to be human and have civil liberties. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7242.08s)]
*  Not, you know, there's a few sort of lonely voices out there that are trying to, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7246.16s)]
*  you know, get some attention on this issue. But there, and there's some, you know, [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7250.4s)]
*  some legal minds starting to think about it. But, you know, when you think about privacy, [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7256.8s)]
*  and, you know, privacy in public places, which is what we're kind of we're talking about with [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7263.360000000001s)]
*  drone data, the regulation is not there yet. You know, personally, I would see that, you know, [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7267.52s)]
*  at minimum, you would want some type of a warrant. So even if you had drones up over, [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7275.04s)]
*  you know, an area, say a high crime area, at some point, you know, as you store that data, [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7281.36s)]
*  and people want to reaccess it who are in government, they should get some type of a [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7286.4s)]
*  court order to allow them to go into that sort of data. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7290.32s)]
*  Got FISA court. Let me laugh bitterly. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7293.36s)]
*  Maybe we can have a different court than FISA court. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7297.2s)]
*  Maybe a different court. And presumably, I mean, you know, taking video from the sky is not the [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7298.96s)]
*  only thing they could do. I mean, they can do thermal imaging, I'm sure there's all kinds of [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7304.48s)]
*  audio recording they could do. I mean, you know, you can collect, you know, [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7309.92s)]
*  cell phone information, you know, from this, you know, obviously from, you know, from the sky, [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7315.12s)]
*  but you can do that from the ground as well. I mean, frankly, you know, if you're a government, [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7318.88s)]
*  you know, say in any country, you know, if you want to, you can access your own telephone networks, [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7323.84s)]
*  you know, your own country's telephone systems. The big privacy change on drones is simply being [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7328.72s)]
*  able to see privacy, you know, or pattern of life information and people going about their daily lives [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7335.68s)]
*  in all aspects when they're out of doors. And you can tell when they go home, you can tell when they [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7344.400000000001s)]
*  go to work, you can tell where they are, you can tell as they move around the city. And again, [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7350.56s)]
*  you can store all that data. So when they tell us, when the Biden administration tells us they [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7354.72s)]
*  know nothing about the guy who shot Trump at the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania in July, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7359.200000000001s)]
*  I'm just going to, I'm just going to be skeptical right there. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7366.400000000001s)]
*  When that happened, what I couldn't understand, and I still understand, [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7371.12s)]
*  what I couldn't understand is with all the drone tech available, why doesn't the Secret Service for [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7378.88s)]
*  all of its protectees put a small number of drones over all these events? You know, you can put it up [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7385.76s)]
*  hours earlier, you know, just to pick up pattern of life and determine, you know, are there things [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7392.88s)]
*  that are going on right now that would- Guys on roofs with rifles and stuff. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7397.92s)]
*  You would think, yes. I mean, that's- Man with rangefinder at magnetometer. [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7401.28s)]
*  That, you know, that I have to say was among one of the more disturbing stories that I've ever [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7405.84s)]
*  watched unfold, you know, even as a private citizen. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7412.64s)]
*  What was that? [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7414.96s)]
*  Systemic incompetence. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7416.320000000001s)]
*  The guy is 22 or whatever and he has no social media profile? [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7419.52s)]
*  I mean, I know less about his backstory, but- [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7427.76s)]
*  But we know nothing about him, his motive, nothing? [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7430.8s)]
*  Yeah, I'd say, you know- If you were covering this, [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7434.72s)]
*  you're a case officer in another- Country. [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7436.8s)]
*  Yeah, country, but not, you know, not Sudan, okay, but like- [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7440.4800000000005s)]
*  Some other place. [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7444.4800000000005s)]
*  More developed country with technology and a, you know, a functioning government. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7445.599999999999s)]
*  And they told you that story, head of state or the aspiring, the challenger to the head of state [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7451.679999999999s)]
*  just gets shot. And we killed the perp, but we don't know anything about him. We don't know why [[02:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7455.679999999999s)]
*  he did it. There's no story whatsoever that would explain this or no relevant facts about the guy. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7461.599999999999s)]
*  What would your assessment be? You go back to your superiors, you'd say what? [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7467.2s)]
*  They'd probably ask me to try harder if I came up with that answer. [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7470.639999999999s)]
*  But that would raise suspicions about the authorities telling you that, correct? [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7475.5199999999995s)]
*  It would make you think that like, you know, there's really, you know, [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7481.28s)]
*  this really can't be your best effort. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7483.679999999999s)]
*  Yeah, there's something going on. Like what? [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7485.599999999999s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, like a lot of things that happen, you know, [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7487.28s)]
*  things get memory hold or forgotten about. Again, you know, I'm not a protective services guy, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7492.48s)]
*  but just the, you know, the, it was one of those stories that every piece of new information you [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7501.68s)]
*  get just makes it worse and worse. You know, just. [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7508.88s)]
*  But the failures intentional or not, I'm not sure it matters, [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7513.92s)]
*  of federal protective services to protect Trump. But I'm talking about the guy, the perpetrator, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7518.16s)]
*  the man with the rifle who shot in the head. [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7525.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7527.4400000000005s)]
*  And the fact that we know, I mean, I mean, you spent your entire life gathering information [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7528.0s)]
*  on people, right? That was your job, right? Gather information. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7532.32s)]
*  You would think you could get more information. You think you could know quite a bit about a person, [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7534.56s)]
*  especially a young person. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7538.96s)]
*  You can, right? [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7540.24s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I haven't looked into his background. [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7541.04s)]
*  No, not him specifically, but. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7543.28s)]
*  Yes. There's anybody born since 2000, you know, certainly has, you know, [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7545.04s)]
*  with the rarest of exceptions, you know, they've got some sort of footprint online. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7552.88s)]
*  You know, they've got a search history. They've got, you know, telephone usage. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7557.2s)]
*  It's very hard to not leave what they call digital dust in your wake about who you are [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7563.76s)]
*  and where you've been and what you've done. I would think in a case where, you know, [[02:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7570.08s)]
*  a significant crime happens, then it would be in the interest of the government [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7575.28s)]
*  to collect and make that known, you know, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7580.08s)]
*  to somebody. And in a case where they don't think there's an ongoing threat, [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7582.32s)]
*  then I would think that there's, you know, the bias should be to talk about what they know. [[02:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7588.0s)]
*  That's what should happen. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7595.599999999999s)]
*  What does it make you think that they haven't done that? What's the conclusion? [[02:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7598.48s)]
*  I don't have a great conclusion on that one. I mean. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7603.759999999999s)]
*  Is that one of the weirdest things you've seen in a while? [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7605.759999999999s)]
*  No. [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7607.44s)]
*  I would say that if I came back to my bosses and I was overseas, [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7609.36s)]
*  they would literally tell me, try harder. That you can clearly get more information than this. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7614.48s)]
*  Well, I hope somebody. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7622.639999999999s)]
*  I hope somebody tries harder. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7624.32s)]
*  I appreciate you taking all this time. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7625.679999999999s)]
*  A pleasure to be here. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7627.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7628.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7629.12s)]
*  So it turns out that YouTube is suppressing our show. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7629.62s)]
*  I know. Shocking that in an election year, with everything at stake, [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7638.099999999999s)]
*  Google would be putting its thumb on the scale and preventing you from hearing anything [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7642.82s)]
*  that the people in charge don't want you to hear. But it turns out it's happening. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7648.66s)]
*  So what can you do about it? Well, we could whine about it. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7651.94s)]
*  That's a waste of time. Not in charge of Google. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7654.5s)]
*  Or we could find a way around it. A way that you could actually get information that's true. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7657.14s)]
*  It's not intentionally deceptive. And the way to do that on YouTube, [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7662.820000000001s)]
*  we think, is to subscribe to our channel. Subscribe and you'll have a [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7666.42s)]
*  much higher chance of hearing what we say. And we hope you will. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61rCf7INomY&t=7671.14s)]
