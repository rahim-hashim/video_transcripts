# Tucker and Chris Cuomo Debate JFK/Epstein Files, DOGE, Joe Rogan, NATO, Transgenderism, and DEI
**The Tucker Carlson Show:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA)
*  So last time we talked was a year ago and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=0.0s)]
*  You somehow look younger. I [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4.08s)]
*  Feel I look like my foreign out and fatter. I've been on the road for too long [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  The first day of lent I'm getting right now [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  But anyway, it's been a year since we talked about this and last time we talked [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=12.92s)]
*  I think you were still like and I probably was too little off balance from being [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=18.06s)]
*  Vomited out of television world into this the great beyond [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=21.8s)]
*  But I was seeing like you this morning I was thinking I bet he's really grateful he's not at CNN now [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=25.26s)]
*  So it gives me no particular joy to say this but you were right [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  Don't get used to it. It's the last time you'll hear it in this conversation [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=39.46s)]
*  I [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=54.98s)]
*  You said give it time [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=63.26s)]
*  embrace [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  Doing what you're doing and don't look for the acceptance of where you were. Yes, and that was really good advice [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=68.34s)]
*  It's not easy to do [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=74.66s)]
*  But News Nation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=77.58s)]
*  Has been what I would call a blessing in my life [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=79.78s)]
*  I didn't know it at the time [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=83.18s)]
*  and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=86.10000000000001s)]
*  Like so my brother's running for mayor [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=87.7s)]
*  My bosses and of course they had the benefit of going to school on what happened with me at CNN. Yeah [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=90.18s)]
*  but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=96.18s)]
*  the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=97.58000000000001s)]
*  embrace the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=98.94000000000001s)]
*  Willingness and acceptance of wow, this is great for your family, you know, this is great for your brother [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=102.38000000000001s)]
*  We're excited for you guys. I like I [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=109.30000000000001s)]
*  Thought it was like a test, you know that if I seemed okay about that. They'd be like aha. We knew we and [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=112.58s)]
*  the difference the change of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=119.38s)]
*  one conversation of them saying well, we're with you we support you and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=128.34s)]
*  Said well, I'm gonna just tell the audience though [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=129.42000000000002s)]
*  I'm not gonna cover the race obviously because I'd have a conflict and they were like, yeah [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=131.32s)]
*  duh, they know that if you feel like you have to say it say it and [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=134.94s)]
*  I [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=139.38s)]
*  realized wow, they they really believe in what I'm doing here and supporting me I love that and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=140.58s)]
*  So there's just a really profound gratitude [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=148.9s)]
*  So there's not this weird hypocrisy where they encourage you to have your brother on because he's famous in the news [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=150.86s)]
*  This is what CNN did you from my perspective watching they encourage you? Hey Chris call your brother have them on and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=155.9s)]
*  Then like a year later like oh wait, you were talking to your brother. You're fired. Yeah, it's too fake [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=162.38000000000002s)]
*  Look as we both know [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=168.10000000000002s)]
*  in every business and especially in ours [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=170.58s)]
*  you do what you have to do to protect yourself and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=174.58s)]
*  If it's you know, if it's me or you and I put myself in a position where I was vulnerable [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=177.9s)]
*  Then it's gonna be me and that's what happened and I accept it. I don't blame CNN [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=183.66000000000003s)]
*  This was really about two people making decisions about my life not the organization. I miss the people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=189.06s)]
*  I wish the place well that is all true, but I have a connection with News Nation and these guys where I [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Am anxious to bleed for them. I am [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=202.2s)]
*  Excited about putting it all on the line every day anywhere in the world because [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=206.04s)]
*  Because of my upbringing and my disposition when I know you're there for me when you don't need to be it's not necessarily [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, there are a lot of big names that you could grab in the media right now [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=219.4s)]
*  For News Nation to give me the chance and to let me do it and to support me and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=223.82s)]
*  To support me when Andrew decides that he's got to be in public service [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  Can't put a price on it [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=234.26s)]
*  Could never be grateful enough. So [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  from a year ago until today I [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=239.5s)]
*  Now know that and there is something comforting about that. It's an ugly business [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=242.66s)]
*  It's an ugly time the ugliest all the wrong things are being rewarded, but I'm in the right place for me [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=248.26s)]
*  It's funny in I don't want to spend two hours beating up on the media because everyone hates them already, but it is [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=254.98s)]
*  It's been almost two years for me since I haven't worked in the media [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=262.21999999999997s)]
*  And it's weird how you when you do work there for your whole life [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=266.02s)]
*  you just accept that like yeah, everyone lies all the time and it's totally treacherous and people who claim to be your friends actually [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=269.82s)]
*  hate you and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  Every dispute is settled with a lawyer. It's like just oh, it's so disgusting, but you just accept [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=277.72s)]
*  That's like the way things work, but that's not how things work outside the media. Um [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=282.16s)]
*  nowhere else in your life, you know, it's part of [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=286.0s)]
*  Politics and media, right? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=290.12s)]
*  there's certainly [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  related if not married and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=294.40000000000003s)]
*  I think that the biggest frustration the look that you and I both know there are lots of great men and women to do the job [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  For the right reasons but as a culture [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=303.04s)]
*  It's okay in the media for me to destroy you [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=306.12s)]
*  by a standard that I would never want imposed on me and [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=310.78000000000003s)]
*  There is something that is really dangerous [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=315.36s)]
*  agree when [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=318.88s)]
*  Well, yeah, I don't want you to know about my life [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=320.56s)]
*  but [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=322.96s)]
*  you we're going after a hundred percent and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=324.04s)]
*  that [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=327.68s)]
*  dichotomy let's call it that paradox is [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=329.08s)]
*  really [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=331.8s)]
*  What's hypocrisy? Yes, and it's really dangerous and look [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=332.88s)]
*  Unfortunately, it works so well, you know if if I were to cover you in any situation and [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=338.11999999999995s)]
*  Put a positive spin on it. That's a puff piece. It's weak Cuomo's been red-pilled [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=345.76s)]
*  he got bought up by that preppy smiley chuckle head and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=351.32s)]
*  If I then say well I sat with Tucker and as I knew it devil spawn [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=355.59999999999997s)]
*  That was a hard-hitting piece, you know, he really came [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=359.7s)]
*  The commodity is negativity if you want to be a hard journalist you better say something negative about somebody [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=364.14000000000004s)]
*  It's a proxy for insight. I just didn't have that's the world been freed yesterday from jail. It hasn't aired yet. But um, and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=370.54s)]
*  I actually really enjoyed the conversation and about five minutes in I was like, oh shit [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=377.1s)]
*  I haven't asked him a single mean question about his business ways. He's in jail for 25 years [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=381.94s)]
*  So I thought I don't really need to make the case that he did something wrong a journey's already, you know [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=385.54s)]
*  already decided that and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=390.26000000000005s)]
*  I think it's okay just like have a conversation with the guy [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=392.38s)]
*  I don't and then I thought well, I'll probably be criticized for sucking up to Sam Bankman Fried [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=395.1s)]
*  And I thought I don't care actually. Well, look you're in a unique position, right? Because one you have no boss [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=399.18s)]
*  To the media is already not looking to be a friend to you [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=405.86s)]
*  So you don't have to you don't have to impress anybody and you can I'm not gonna win them over Margaret Brennan's not gonna text me [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=410.34000000000003s)]
*  Congratulations, you can do whatever you want to do and there's and there's a lot of freedom in that and of course there challenges [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=417.82000000000005s)]
*  Of you having to support yourself and find opportunities and build your own infrastructure [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=424.18s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of entrepreneurial stuff that you and I never had to deal with before sure [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=428.66s)]
*  so you can just have a conversation with him because [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=432.82000000000005s)]
*  The media doesn't know what to do with digital and independent media [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=437.0s)]
*  The instinct was to disrespect it. Oh, of course, right marginalize it and I think on a reporting level that's still safe ground [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=440.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean what's popping on digital media isn't [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  Investigative reporting per se there are some tie B Schellenberg or stuff like that, but Barry Weiss at the free press, but [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  It's mostly hot takes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=457.44s)]
*  But now that we're realizing in our society and I'm very excited about it power is shifting back to people [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=459.59999999999997s)]
*  And from institutions and that's really uncomfortable for some people [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=466.44s)]
*  Yes, I think the Democrats are in a weird place where they seem like which is such anathema as Mario Cuomo's kid [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=469.44s)]
*  He was so anti establishment, but they seem pro establishment [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=475.11999999999995s)]
*  Defenders of the status quo and I think that's a really dangerous place to be right now because I think power is shifting towards [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=479.28s)]
*  being disruptive of [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  institutions and of [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=487.88s)]
*  the elites in a very real way and [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=490.4s)]
*  Digital media is much better positioned to be empowered by that than what they're now calling legacy media [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=493.88s)]
*  I don't buy into that as a pejorative, but I see it and I see that people are really open to getting a [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=500.12s)]
*  Two things are happening at the same time siloed. Absolutely [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=508.72s)]
*  but also [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=512.32s)]
*  People are realizing that they can reach out and get different versions of events and takes on things in a way that they couldn't [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=513.6s)]
*  Before and I think that's really exciting and the media doesn't know what to do with it [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=521.24s)]
*  It's make it's amazing and you know, I think the most influential people in media [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=525.4s)]
*  I think you have to put Rogan at the top of that [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=530.16s)]
*  you know kind of don't work for anybody and [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=532.28s)]
*  And it's just so interesting if you look at the ads on Margaret Brennan show, it's like, you know Nissan and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=535.84s)]
*  Joe Rogan, it's like prostate health cures [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=541.72s)]
*  It's like that it's the whole guys like Rogan have become rich famous influential [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=544.36s)]
*  Completely outside. Yes, the conventional certainly Rogan certainly Rogan but all of them [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=551.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean all of them Megyn Kelly is enormously influential. I haven't seen her ads but like but she's still corporate backed, right? She's serious XM [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=555.8s)]
*  She was Fox as you well know didn't work for her at NBC, which really wasn't a surprise to anybody in there [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=564.04s)]
*  You know, it's being a network anchor being a storyteller being a host that is accommodative of broad [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=570.64s)]
*  Audiences that are looking to be [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=577.9200000000001s)]
*  Inoffensive. Yes, that's a very different skill set that she clearly was gonna struggle with so I wasn't surprised by that [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=580.76s)]
*  But she's serious XM [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=586.52s)]
*  Now Rogan is Spotify, but he built that all himself, but you're wondering though, but still I mean Rogan is [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=589.0s)]
*  You know in some sense like bigger than spy he could leave Spotify I think Megan could I was surprised he took the deal [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=596.3199999999999s)]
*  I was surprised he took what gives him a lot of freedom. But here's my question. You see every kind of [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=601.4399999999999s)]
*  Mid-sized independent business in America getting scooped up by private equity [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=608.64s)]
*  So every veterinary practice every dental office, yes, he AC places [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=613.04s)]
*  Cemetery associations like there is this inexorable trend toward like conglomerates. Yes small independent [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=618.12s)]
*  It's getting scooped up by some big umbrella group. That's gonna happen in media. I would think we are [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  presently [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=633.16s)]
*  Realizing so there was that big wave of deals that you and I missed in the podcast space where people were just [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=635.04s)]
*  Throwing money to have a footprint in it, right Rogan was the biggest of those deals, right? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=640.28s)]
*  but [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=646.68s)]
*  then it went away and [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=647.8s)]
*  When I got into it I'm all self-financed because well I was damaged goods [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=649.88s)]
*  But people weren't looking to just throw money at a podcast because no one was making money on those deals [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  It was like relearning the Howard Stern lesson that they paid him all that money at Sirius XM and it's like, you know [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=659.04s)]
*  What was the yield? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=664.56s)]
*  now [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=666.04s)]
*  different people are starting to buy a podcast that are traditional media companies and [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=667.92s)]
*  They are the seed capital behind the private equity behind those organizations [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=673.92s)]
*  Are starting to buy up these properties that freaks me out because the reason independent media are credible is [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=679.8399999999999s)]
*  Because they're independent. Yes, they're not controlled. Yes [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=687.1999999999999s)]
*  Now I struggle with that a little bit that absolutely can be true and again, Tai Ibi [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=690.4799999999999s)]
*  Schellenberger, okay. Yeah, but I don't dismiss and Barry Weiss [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=695.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't like leaving her out free press is a really cool thing that she's building there [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  and I like that she's able to do something that I never saw it a news organization before which is she's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=702.3599999999999s)]
*  Decidedly pro-israel. Okay, she's Jewish and beyond her own cultural and religious affinity [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=709.08s)]
*  She has an ideological one and she owns it and she's out there for it. You may disagree. That's okay [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=714.2800000000001s)]
*  But you know, whereas what the world that you and I grew up in media wise [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=720.0400000000001s)]
*  They had all these opinions, but you'd never know it [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=726.48s)]
*  You know what I mean? You'd have to glean it from what you saw on camera [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=729.4000000000001s)]
*  Nobody ever came out and said it, you know that we think that this is right. We think this is wrong [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=732.2s)]
*  Very very rarely. So what I like about it is I [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=737.4799999999999s)]
*  Believe that there's space for all of it. Okay [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=743.28s)]
*  When I got into this business 25 years ago, they told me, you know, network news is dead [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=746.0s)]
*  Right. The number one show on television is world news tonight. So the idea that it's dead. It's not dead [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=750.76s)]
*  It's just changing and their stratification, but I do think there's a challenge afoot [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=756.8399999999999s)]
*  People in every different platform have to reconnect with their constituency [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=762.28s)]
*  Trust is at an all-time low with every kind of institution now within that is a burden for the media, but also an opportunity [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=767.24s)]
*  That's why I'm so excited that I may have been in the wrong place at other phases in my career [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=774.4799999999999s)]
*  But I'm in the right place right now because like News Nation is like one [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=779.88s)]
*  Pebble on the beach at a time of hey, everybody's going crazy about this [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=784.68s)]
*  Not us [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=789.28s)]
*  tariffs are kind of scary and they can hurt prices, but [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=791.16s)]
*  Trump does this and he's looking to get something done [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=795.76s)]
*  Let's not microanalyze him saying tariffs like this is definitely gonna happen this way forever and let's see what happens [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=799.04s)]
*  News Nation were allowed to do that [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=806.52s)]
*  Most outlets have to pick a side [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=808.64s)]
*  Tariffs best thing like Fox News tariffs are great. We can't wait. This is gonna be great [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=811.28s)]
*  It's gonna unleash the economy get rid of the income tax [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=816.08s)]
*  MSNBC, this is the worst. It's gonna crush the economy. You got to have a take you got to have a side [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=819.36s)]
*  News Nation is able to harness the independent mentality of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=824.92s)]
*  There's a plus minus on this right and we're gonna have to see here, right? [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=830.48s)]
*  There's gonna have to be some patience, right and I love that space. It's harder [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=834.12s)]
*  It's way harder than saying I hate Trump [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=838.1999999999999s)]
*  Or Trump was sent by Jehovah, you know, those are much easier positions [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=842.0s)]
*  But I believe in the potential honesty is kind of the kind of the point [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=846.8s)]
*  I mean, I think you should be allowed to arrive at whatever conclusion you sincerely arrive at and you should be able to tell people [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=850.04s)]
*  That that's your job [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=855.24s)]
*  And if you work at a place where like you know that you can't say something you believe is true [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=856.1999999999999s)]
*  It's the wrong place for you [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=861.3199999999999s)]
*  I agree [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=862.5999999999999s)]
*  But look we're benefiting from the change feel that there are things that you is an unfair question to ask you what the camera's going [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=863.3199999999999s)]
*  But the only con you ask [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  Specializing that but do you do you feel like there are things that you can't say like if you came to a conclusion now [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=871.76s)]
*  I don't mean about like some individual sex life or like nasty personal attacks [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=877.8399999999999s)]
*  But I mean like a policy position that you came to that you would be like, I probably can't say that no [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=883.28s)]
*  I'm there to say it [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=887.88s)]
*  So really you don't feel like there are any red lines [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=890.5999999999999s)]
*  My bosses are very worried about you advancing agendas that you don't disclose [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=892.9599999999999s)]
*  Now or one me. Yeah, you know what I mean? Well, if you come to News Nation, then yes you too [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=899.3599999999999s)]
*  But right now it's you know, hey look if you feel that way just you better say it [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=904.56s)]
*  Don't just stack your show with guests that are all on one side of something [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=909.28s)]
*  Oh, I love that and then pretend you're fair. So don't do that. Yeah, be transparent the same thing be transparent [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=913.88s)]
*  And you may be wrong right that happens [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=919.96s)]
*  Often but own it correct it move on do not hide the ball [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=923.0s)]
*  They really say that the hundred percent because also remember well, I admire that I'll just admire that News Nation [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=928.12s)]
*  is [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=934.92s)]
*  Owned by a company that really knows local TV, right? They own the most local TV stations. What is [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=936.1999999999999s)]
*  What has the most currency in media still visual media local news? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=943.0799999999999s)]
*  the boss of me directly I have like 10 bosses starting with dusty on up but the [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=948.84s)]
*  Mike Korn is an ABC News Pro who did every job. So he's not a corporate guy [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=954.28s)]
*  He was in the field he knows how to edit he was in the control room. He was you know, he did all the jobs [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=961.2s)]
*  He's written the pieces. So he knows the alchemy of journalism. So he understands when someone's fake in the funk and what's transparent? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=966.2s)]
*  Versus which is what is trickery so they've got a good setup there for it [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=974.32s)]
*  However, I'm still a Cuomo and it was really important to me when Andrew decided he was gonna run that I had to go to [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=978.4399999999999s)]
*  them and say I [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=984.8s)]
*  Work for you. What do you want me to do on this? Do you want me to I offered? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=986.2s)]
*  Do you want me to take a leave for the pendency of the campaign? I'm not running the campaign [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=991.04s)]
*  I'm not part of the campaign. That's not gonna happen. But if you think you don't haven't lived through this before [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=996.24s)]
*  I don't want to hurt News Nation. What you're doing is so important way more important than me [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1001.36s)]
*  Do you want that now? Obviously they said no [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1007.6s)]
*  You're being silly and traumatized [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1011.36s)]
*  And [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1014.5600000000001s)]
*  But that was helpful also so can can Andrew win can he win? Yes [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1015.76s)]
*  So I should say I know it at Eric Adams and I and I like Eric Adams can win [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  I am highly distressed by how dirty and chaotic and dangerous New York is I'm really really bothered [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1026.24s)]
*  I almost don't even care about the ideology. I don't care what you know [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1033.92s)]
*  Rent control debates or tax. I just I just want to be safe walking down the street [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  I get it and I get it doesn't seem to have been able to do that. Well, let's defend Eric Adams. Shall we? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1041.1599999999999s)]
*  I have I'd like to hear you do it and so have I [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1046.76s)]
*  Why your brother's running against them? That's [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1050.76s)]
*  That's not what my family is about [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1053.48s)]
*  If Andrew is the better choice for the voters in the primary then he'll win [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1055.72s)]
*  If he isn't then he'll lose and you sign up for that when you decide to get into it [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1061.24s)]
*  Do I want him to win? Of course, he's my brother [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1066.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't even vote in New York City. So it's it's uh, you know, this is a family thing for me [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1069.0s)]
*  But all you got to do is google it [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1074.2s)]
*  I believe the indictment against Eric Adams was weak sauce. Yeah, and yes, I heard much much later [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1076.8400000000001s)]
*  That they had more they never put it out an indictment is already just probable cause [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1084.28s)]
*  It's the lowest layer of a prosecutorial instrument [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1088.44s)]
*  It's totally immoral for the government at any level to impugn your character without charging you if you have the evidence charge me [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1090.92s)]
*  And they they charged him but they should have brought out whatever they said they had what they said is everyone looked at the indictment [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1097.16s)]
*  It's like wait you accepted airline upgrades [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1101.96s)]

*  But I didn't know my brother was doing anything politically when I started my coverage of mayor Adams [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1111.24s)]
*  And I believe trump's deal with him is not fair to eric adams should have pardoned him or dismissed the charges [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1116.52s)]
*  With prejudice meaning you can't bring them again because think about it tucker if I had that deal with you [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1124.12s)]

*  The guy has the biggest gorilla in the world staring at him like he's food [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1153.56s)]

*  Obviously, um a lot too much. I've given up pizza. Look, we both know the city very well, right new york new yorkers deserve [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1254.66s)]
*  their reputation [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1263.8799999999999s)]
*  It's a tough place [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1265.96s)]
*  And it is a place where the rules have to mean something [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1267.8s)]
*  It is too many people in too small a space. Yeah [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1273.96s)]
*  To have anything chaotic [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1278.1999999999998s)]
*  Uh it a little bit of a problem [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1281.0s)]
*  Blows up really fast in that city [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1284.04s)]
*  One two, three four five things happen in the subway. It's like five thousand things happen in the subway [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1287.72s)]
*  the feel [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1292.92s)]
*  Becomes magnified. Yes. So having grown up, right? I mean i'm born and bred [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1294.8400000000001s)]
*  I remember life in the 70s [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1301.16s)]
*  And that's how people talk [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1304.76s)]
*  Today I think I could make a case that statistically it ain't the 70s in a lot of different ways [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1307.16s)]
*  For the better, but that's how they feel and I haven't heard this talk [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1313.72s)]
*  I haven't seen people on the subway as I do now unless they're in their 20s and therefore unable to look up from their screen [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1317.96s)]
*  Because they've been completely [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1324.1200000000001s)]
*  Destroyed by these devices everyone's looking around now on the subway when you're walking on the street eyes are up [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1326.7600000000002s)]
*  You know people people have their hands out just like it was when it was in the in the 70s [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1333.64s)]
*  I remember people were afraid when you say you're going to the city [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1338.68s)]
*  People talk to you like you need to have a plan. Yeah, and [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1341.5600000000002s)]
*  That's corrosive it hurts property values. It hurts the corporate interest in being there [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1345.4s)]
*  So new york is a place that uniquely needs to have that sense [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1350.68s)]
*  That things are under control [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1355.0800000000002s)]
*  And that is not an easy job. Not an easy job. Well, it just takes a fascist [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1357.5600000000002s)]
*  Um to do it. No it does not I don't mean the way that just slides out of your mouth a fascist [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1362.2s)]
*  Yeah, like [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1369.48s)]
*  Like bloomberg, I don't mean I don't mean a fascist. I mean fascist and like hating people on the basis of ethnicity or anything like that [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1370.68s)]
*  I mean like [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1376.04s)]
*  Someone who enforces the rules and is not embarrassed about it at all. It's just like i'm sorry. That's against the law [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1377.24s)]
*  We're not putting up with it. Not for one second. No, you can't and by the way, you're smoking weed on the street [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1381.72s)]
*  How about no like no, we're not a little bit of singapore in new york city or [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1387.48s)]
*  Honestly as someone who travels a lot. I find it really embarrassing going to new york [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1393.16s)]
*  I find the airport's embarrassing the drive-in is embarrassing. I'm an american. I love my country [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1396.44s)]
*  LaGuardia is the number one airport is my brother's signature achievement [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1400.68s)]
*  LaGuardia is the number one airport in the country. It's way, I don't know by what standard. I think it's way better [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1404.68s)]
*  I agree, but like it took like 20 years to do that. It was pathetic [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1409.3200000000002s)]
*  It's just like build the freaking airport like everyone else does it's hard [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1413.64s)]
*  Andrew was the only one who could get it done. I was in the Doha airport two days ago [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1416.68s)]
*  I texted my wife for this picture. I was like this is what we could have if people would just stop being ridiculous [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1418.8400000000001s)]
*  Well, build something beautiful maintain it. It's not that hard. I agree but [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1423.64s)]
*  The reason I come at you about saying you need a fascist [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1428.6000000000001s)]
*  I shouldn't have used the word fascist, but I mean you like need like that's why i'm here took [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1432.2800000000002s)]
*  You just need you need someone who's who's committed to protecting the weak. Yes [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1436.44s)]
*  But here's the difference and I know what you mean what i'm saying is this and and it's worth examining right now with what people [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1443.0s)]
*  are [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1449.96s)]
*  worried about with the trump administration [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1451.16s)]
*  is [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1453.5600000000002s)]
*  It's got to be bigger than you the problem with fascism. It's not about you. Okay, it's not about trump [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1454.76s)]
*  It's not about who's the mayor of new york city [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1461.24s)]
*  There's a system there are institutions [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1463.24s)]
*  There is law and order and you've got to work within that and you've got to be zealous about wanting those things to work [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1466.2s)]
*  For the right people the right way [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1471.0800000000002s)]
*  But it can't get any bigger [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1473.0800000000002s)]
*  That for the individual well, I would I would just strongly agree with that [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1475.5600000000002s)]
*  I'm totally opposed to cults because bloomberg was not fascist. I don't he was good at using the system [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1479.4s)]
*  That's a term that I that's why you got three terms. Yeah, look [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1484.1999999999998s)]
*  I hate I think it should be legal for politicians to name things after themselves. No politicians should ever have anything named after himself [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1488.6799999999998s)]
*  That's my view because we're paying these people. They're our servants [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1494.6s)]
*  Why are they taking our money to build money and spend to themselves? [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1497.6399999999999s)]
*  So i'm against all self-aggrandizement by anybody actually especially politicians. I'm just saying it's the greatest city in the greatest nation on earth [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1500.52s)]
*  And it looks like garbage like it smells it's dirty it doesn't work very well [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1509.48s)]
*  It's like it's not acceptable travel around the world. Not everyone lives like that, right? [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1513.56s)]
*  And we don't have to so like let's just make it worthy of the great nation that it represents [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1517.56s)]
*  Look, I I think there are a lot of people who feel that way and I I could explain it away [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1521.96s)]
*  There are a lot of things that would be really hard to control that are at play in new york city [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1526.68s)]
*  But it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. It's how people feel [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1530.92s)]
*  And look, I I listen to my brother very carefully about this [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1534.12s)]
*  as [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1538.76s)]
*  Someone other than his kids. I mean there's nobody [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1539.8799999999999s)]
*  That andrew matters more to than me [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1542.9199999999998s)]
*  Andrew raised me. He's not just my brother. He's 13 years older than I am [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1545.8s)]
*  Everything i'm into are all his hobbies and attributes [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1551.08s)]
*  Because he taught me all these things my father was so committed to public service that he was away a lot when I was young [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1555.56s)]
*  He was in albany and we were in queens. So andrew [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1561.32s)]
*  Taught me how to throw a ball taught me how to ride a bike taught me how to tackle taught me how to defend myself [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1565.48s)]
*  Uh taught me why why you're there for your family and how taught me about why you got to keep the driveway clean [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1570.6799999999998s)]
*  And how to work on cars like all these things how to fish how to boat all these things [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1576.4399999999998s)]
*  um was my was my brother so [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1581.56s)]
*  I am really really [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1585.9599999999998s)]
*  attached [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1588.12s)]
*  Uh to him and his well-being [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1589.1599999999999s)]
*  And when you hear someone that you love and care about say [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1592.14s)]
*  Hey, I think i'm gonna go run for office again. I've got to serve [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1595.74s)]
*  I know why that sounds great to [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1599.98s)]
*  New yorkers, but to me it's [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1603.26s)]
*  You want more of that? That is the dirtiest most unfair [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1606.14s)]
*  savage [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1613.0s)]

*  There's no chance it's like he's telling me he wants to go wrestle a komodo dragon, you know what he means like hey [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1617.0200000000002s)]
*  I really got to do this you're going to bleed [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1623.2600000000002s)]
*  They're actively going to try to hurt you [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1626.6200000000001s)]
*  With no regard for the merits [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1629.8200000000002s)]
*  And we call it the game [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1632.94s)]
*  But it's like thunderdome [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1634.7s)]
*  so as someone who loves [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1636.38s)]
*  him [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1638.5400000000002s)]
*  Why would I be excited about him wanting to expose himself? Of course not but look when I hear him [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1640.14s)]
*  It's like you know, I almost [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1644.86s)]
*  Tear up because it's so much like my father my father used to describe public service [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1647.34s)]
*  You know my father hated that I went into the media by the way [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1651.5s)]
*  I'm sure there's a sure i'm sure my my therapist could have like a whole field [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1655.02s)]
*  I don't even open that box of chocolates with my therapist because I know i'd be paying for the rest of my life about just explaining [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1658.3799999999999s)]
*  that but [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1663.1s)]
*  His problem with it was [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1665.1s)]
*  Why do you want to be part? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1667.26s)]
*  Of a group that just criticizes people who are trying to get things done when you could actually be trying to get something done [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1669.34s)]
*  and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1675.74s)]
*  That's why he believed in public service. Andrew is the same thing. He skips right past the price [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1676.78s)]
*  Of entry which I could never I could never get past it [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1682.46s)]
*  I'd be like no way i'm gonna have a hundred tucker carlsons chewing on my ass like a dog toy every day [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1686.3s)]
*  Not gonna happen. I won't be able to handle it. I want to fight them all the time [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1690.94s)]
*  and he goes right past that to the [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1695.82s)]
*  All of these ideas about what he could do in that capacity and what needs to be done [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1698.62s)]
*  And i'm like, yeah, but [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1704.06s)]
*  You have to go through this gauntlet to get to this place just to try to do this really hard thing [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1706.3s)]
*  and he looks at me like [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1712.3799999999999s)]
*  and [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1714.62s)]
*  and [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1716.06s)]
*  So you gotta I gotta support. I mean i'm for that level of intensity. You just cannot let people [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1717.82s)]
*  Wreck the city. You can't let them live on the side. That's how he feels. You can't let him smoke weed in the park [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1724.3799999999999s)]
*  I agree with you. I would just want somebody else to deal with it. Yeah [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1728.6999999999998s)]
*  No, um because it's look it's such a hellscape right now. Look what works in politics [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1731.98s)]
*  If i'm running against you for anything, okay? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1737.26s)]
*  Strategy is simple. We got to destroy him. What can we find on him? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1741.42s)]
*  Well, actually I think the lesson is it doesn't work because trump is now the president [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1745.02s)]
*  Well, that is true. He did overcome. I mean they went after his family. They did overcome his sons in jail [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1748.54s)]
*  He did overcome in jail, right? They shot him but he is [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1753.9s)]
*  He is a unicorn [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1757.34s)]
*  Also, he is the true teflon don but it's an inspiration like what you know [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1759.58s)]
*  Whatever you think of trump or what he does [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1763.8999999999999s)]
*  He's basically saying the same things he was saying 25 years ago. You can pull the tape on larry king live [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1765.5s)]
*  about tariffs [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1771.1s)]
*  About immigration about foreign policy. He's basically I mean he's changed of course on a lot of little things [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1772.62s)]
*  But on the big things exactly the same and he just kept going [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1778.22s)]
*  And and it worked so well, I think that maybe trump is a lesson that there are limits to what the personal attack [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1782.22s)]
*  That's what I was going to say is that I think that he's more [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1788.38s)]
*  of [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1791.82s)]
*  a [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1793.74s)]
*  Symptom than he is a cause [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1794.76s)]
*  people [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1799.82s)]
*  the election message was [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1801.26s)]
*  You guys are focusing on things that don't matter to us the way you want them to right? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1803.9s)]
*  And what does matter to us doesn't matter enough to you and what they saw in trump were two main things [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1810.14s)]
*  one the personification of this that you are trying to destroy this guy on a basis that we are not really okay with [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1818.14s)]
*  and the second thing is that [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1826.14s)]
*  He wants to disrupt all the things that we believe [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1829.02s)]
*  Need disruption [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1833.42s)]
*  and his views [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1835.26s)]
*  Between the cancel culture and different cultural wars as we call them [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1837.82s)]
*  donald trump [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1843.26s)]
*  For whatever you want to say about him negatively [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1845.5s)]
*  approximated normal [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1848.52s)]
*  To the american voters more than the democrats did [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1850.94s)]
*  And that's that's the message just scared the crap out of everybody, but I mean that's an example of what i'm saying [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1854.86s)]
*  I think there are many examples, but that one was like so florid and crazy that and it's still going on [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1861.34s)]
*  That I know I to this day [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1868.7s)]
*  I don't understand it and we live in a world where there are always going to be people who [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1870.54s)]
*  Want to wear women's clothes or whatever fine. Oh, I understand it. I look you saw it you saw to elevate [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1874.7800000000002s)]
*  Traneism to like the top of the agenda list. I can explain it to you very easily. It's it's it's readily apparent and look we saw the same [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1880.1200000000001s)]
*  mistake [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1888.1200000000001s)]
*  On display when the president addressed congress, okay, that is not a time [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1889.5800000000002s)]
*  For you to be obnoxious [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1895.8200000000002s)]
*  If he wants to be obnoxious fine [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1897.74s)]
*  You are there at a respect for the office there are rules of decorum in that place [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1900.46s)]
*  I believe there should be rules of decorum in all places in media and politics, but there aren't but there are there [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1904.3s)]
*  and they [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1911.74s)]
*  Willfully and wantedly abuse them [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1913.24s)]
*  To make a point that they are against trump [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1916.6200000000001s)]
*  And it was a bad look for the democrats [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1920.06s)]
*  What is it an extension of? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1924.86s)]
*  We as democrats they will tell you we are resisting [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1927.5s)]
*  Who he wants to abuse and what he wants to destroy like what? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1932.6999999999998s)]
*  Trans are a unique minority in this country. They are uniquely targeted [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1936.6999999999998s)]
*  They need protection. Um [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1941.5s)]
*  We are going to protect them. Okay, but this particular aspect of the issue [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1944.3799999999999s)]
*  Guys my size who decide to become female and play against my daughter in high school [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1949.8999999999999s)]
*  That is not what you need to protect them [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1954.6200000000001s)]
*  From or against that's something that doesn't make sense. Nope [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1957.18s)]
*  We have to hold to the purity of the cause of protecting this minority group [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1961.74s)]
*  Yeah, but you're not protecting them. You're protecting the people that are playing against them because they're 230 pounds [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1967.74s)]
*  Yeah, it almost never happens. But if it happens once it's something that never needed to happen [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1972.54s)]
*  the purity test [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1978.7s)]
*  The absolutist nature of binary politics that if you are for something you have to be all in on it beyond any conception of reason [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1980.94s)]
*  That's what we're dealing with in our politics. That's what that is [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1990.3s)]
*  Well, of course I can think of a million topics on which that is true [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1992.94s)]
*  I think I see that with guns on the right, but maybe right. Um [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=1996.06s)]
*  You know, i'm an absolutist on that I could tell you why it's not even that interesting [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2001.1000000000001s)]
*  But what I think but you know the right to self-defense is a part of natural law [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2004.7s)]
*  The idea that a man can become a woman by wishing it. So is [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2010.3000000000002s)]
*  Not only a violation of natural law. It's a violation of nature itself. It's like inherently insane [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2014.38s)]
*  That's a denial of physical reality. And so why so if the argument is [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2018.6200000000001s)]
*  You know, there are people with weird sexual impulses who we shouldn't like scapegoat and hurt [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2023.5800000000002s)]
*  I mean i'm totally in agreement with that. It is a perversion of live and let live [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2028.94s)]
*  So but but but no in the interest of the rest of us to tell a lie. That's the perversion [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2033.66s)]
*  That's where that's that's when you feel like well, this is a spiritual attack [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2039.02s)]
*  Well, it's it doesn't have to be a lie in the interest of live and let live right? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2042.86s)]
*  Which is a signature american freedom or should be right? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2046.86s)]
*  You don't want these people to live the way they want to live you are infringing on their rights. We will protect them [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2050.94s)]
*  now [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2056.06s)]
*  I understand the political philosophy behind that [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2057.58s)]
*  But once it entered a realm of where the people that you say you're trying to protect are now a problem [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2060.8599999999997s)]
*  For another group that need protection also, which are these kids? [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2068.54s)]
*  They didn't they didn't click into the common sense. They more than that though. It's like [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2072.54s)]
*  The idea that the government should be involved in people's sex lives [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2078.7799999999997s)]
*  Is a shocking concept to me. I don't think it should be me either and they're promoting [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2082.7s)]
*  homosexuality [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2088.68s)]
*  Promoting it and i'll tell you how we know that they're promoting it because its incidence has risen dramatically now when I was [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2090.12s)]
*  A young man there was a debate over what percentage of the population is gay [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2096.8599999999997s)]
*  I was never anti-gay for the record and i'm not now [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2100.22s)]
*  But it's an interesting question. They would say you're born that way. You're born gay [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2103.02s)]
*  So you cannot criticize someone on the basis of his immutable characteristics. Great. I totally agree with that [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2106.7s)]
*  But then we saw the absolute incidence of self-reported homosexuality like triple [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2112.22s)]
*  So clearly people aren't born that way, you know, 30 percent of eighth graders were born gay. No, that's not true [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2116.9399999999996s)]
*  And so there's been this dramatic rise that none of us are allowed to notice it's like you can't notice that well why [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2123.42s)]
*  Okay. Yes, I can [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2128.7s)]
*  and i'm [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2130.7s)]
*  sort of thunderstruck by it like what is that and it clearly is [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2131.82s)]
*  a manifestation of the deeper truth, which is [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2136.3s)]
*  Maybe people some people are born gay, but people can also be moved [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2139.34s)]
*  Toward self-identifying as gay and that's exactly what's happened [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2143.98s)]
*  so why anyway, so like [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2147.9s)]
*  I don't think that's good. I don't think that's good. And I also don't understand where the government should be [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2150.86s)]
*  Taking my tax dollars to convince people that certain forms of sex are better than others, particularly non-procreative sex [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2156.38s)]
*  Like what the hell is that? Well, look [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2162.86s)]
*  I [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2165.9s)]
*  it's an easy legal and moral backstop that government should not be in the [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2167.1800000000003s)]
*  business of type [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2172.14s)]
*  Okay, that's easy. There's plenty of things that government should be doing that isn't necessary [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2173.58s)]
*  I believe that is an extension to how people choose [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2178.86s)]
*  their own [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2183.1800000000003s)]
*  Bodies and how they use them. I believe in reproductive rights. I think it is a right [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2184.6200000000003s)]
*  however, I see [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2189.98s)]
*  gay acceptance a little differently [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2192.38s)]
*  The difference of a generation from our kids to us is it's much safer to say that you're gay now than it was [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2195.42s)]
*  Uh, you used to get beat up you used to get ostracized you used to get excluded [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2201.5800000000004s)]
*  That happens less now it still happens but it happens less [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2205.98s)]
*  Is there also [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2209.26s)]
*  A cultural formation that we see like in america everything goes in these big swings in different directions always reaction formation [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2211.1800000000003s)]
*  Are we more gay friendly in our culture? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2219.26s)]
*  Aggressively so assertively so than we were when we were growing up. Yes [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2223.0s)]
*  Can that make it more attractive to young people who are struggling and trying to figure themselves out? Maybe [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2227.58s)]
*  And that's why I remember when I was in college [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2233.5s)]
*  There were a lot of people who were gay in college who weren't gay afterwards [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2235.9s)]
*  Now a lot of them were gay in college and gay afterwards [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2240.06s)]
*  But I think there's something to experimenting and certain people play out with identity. It's like, okay [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2242.06s)]
*  But I just want to get like the core question, which is where does this come from? [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2247.3399999999997s)]
*  Being gay is it inborn? We were told you're born that way. Okay, so where's the gene? There isn't one [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2251.5s)]
*  I don't know the genetics, but I believe no one has isolated it [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2258.94s)]
*  But you haven't noticed when you were raising your kids that there would be certain kids that you were like [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2261.66s)]
*  I think this 100 100. Oh, yes [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2266.62s)]
*  I like as where they were too young to be mimicking it. I I did I absolutely did notice that [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2269.58s)]
*  Um, and so i'm not saying there's not a genetic component. I'm just saying and I don't know the answer is the truth [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2274.86s)]
*  But what I do know is if you've got a third of middle schoolers saying i'm not heterosexual [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2280.62s)]
*  That's not place to a fad that's not more than it does [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2285.68s)]
*  It's not inborn. I think that there's two things can be true. You can have that it's [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2288.48s)]
*  Easier to be accepted today. I'm not saying that [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2292.88s)]
*  That it's the same. I'd still believe that when people are gay [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2296.16s)]
*  It's like the main descriptor of them whereas you and I don't identify or oh talk across and you know him straight guy [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2298.64s)]
*  You know, but when you're gay you still get labeled that way [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2304.16s)]
*  But I think two things can be happening at the same time that there is a culture of persuasion [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2307.76s)]
*  Uh in let's say in a guided or misguided sense of acceptance [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2312.16s)]
*  And I think it is safer for people to come out now than it was a generation ago. Yes [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2318.24s)]
*  both are true, but it's [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2323.12s)]
*  I guess the point i'm making is it's really clear that the federal government state governments local governments and ngo's are promoting homosexuality among kids [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2325.2s)]
*  obviously true to me and [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2333.84s)]
*  Transgenderism among kids and my point is [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2335.9s)]
*  That is not acceptable [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2338.88s)]
*  and when I was a child if an adult went up to a kid in a park and start talking to him about his sex life [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2340.64s)]
*  He could shoot the guy because that that that that's not acceptable to talk to other people's children about sex [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2345.84s)]
*  Period and now it's not only acceptable. It's the rule and it's paid for by my tax dollars [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2352.2400000000002s)]
*  And i'm just saying like that's really destructive. Look it is a very persuasive argument [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2356.8s)]
*  I don't know. It certainly hasn't been my it hasn't been my experience in my kids schools public and private [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2362.3199999999997s)]
*  Um that I felt that they were being indoctrinated [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2368.88s)]
*  They didn't have pride week into any pride month or pride celebrations. I don't remember it specifically [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2372.08s)]
*  But even if they did let's say they did I I don't I can't prove that right now, but let's say they did [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2377.2s)]
*  um [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2382.3199999999997s)]
*  That to me is not the same thing as indoctrination. I have no problem [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2383.6s)]
*  with adults and children being exposed [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2388.0s)]
*  to [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2392.08s)]
*  Different belief systems and different ways and different cultures. I have no problem with tolerance [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2392.96s)]
*  Now indoctrination tolerance. Well pride is not tolerance pride is the opposite of tolerance pride is a celebration [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2399.52s)]
*  And so you're celebrating certain sex acts with other people's kids [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2406.4s)]
*  And I just think right there you've crossed a line pride week doesn't have to be children, right? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2411.2s)]
*  When you have the uh, when you have the you know, the st patrick's day parade [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not making people be irish [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2420.3999999999996s)]
*  I totally agree. I'm talking about kids i'm talking about schools. You're talking about by the way [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2422.64s)]
*  I don't have any problem with [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2427.04s)]
*  Heterosexual pride gay pride, you know people are happy about the way that they live. That's fine [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2429.18s)]
*  I have a huge problem [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2435.68s)]
*  with schools or governments [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2437.68s)]
*  getting involved in [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2440.7999999999997s)]
*  The sexuality of children. Yeah, I 100 agree, but every school does it there's not one school that doesn't have their job is to keep everybody [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2443.2s)]
*  No, but it's not safe. It's promoting it. No, I got I got you I get what would bother you [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2450.24s)]
*  I'm saying their job is to keep kids safe, which means if my kid is gay your kid can't beat him up [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2454.3999999999996s)]
*  On that basis. That's the role of the school. That's the rule of the law [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2460.96s)]
*  Is you know people have to be able to live and be free and safe [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2465.12s)]
*  It's different to you trying to teach my kid to be gay if that's going on obviously it would be a problem [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2469.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think if i've never experienced a massive percentage of middle schoolers are gay [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2474.56s)]
*  In general possessions are overrated, but there are some things you really would not want stolen and to me [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2478.88s)]
*  Family shotguns including a whole bunch of them. I got from my father [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2485.92s)]
*  Are at the top of that list so I keep my dad's shotguns in a liberty safe [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2490.08s)]
*  Because it's safe and it's also really attractive liberty safe just creates something really cool [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2495.36s)]
*  It's a limited edition safe that commemorates the inauguration of donald trump america's 47th president [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2500.8s)]
*  The original design celebrates [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2506.8s)]
*  Trump and his swearing animal upholding liberty's commitment to building their safes right here in the united states and they went all out on this one [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2508.88s)]
*  It's the special 47 edition. It features a one-of-a-kind artwork that pays homage to the president [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2515.92s)]
*  It's very very cool. Not all safes are created equal [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2522.32s)]
*  There are plenty out there and a lot of the manufacturers slap an american-sending name on the label [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2525.44s)]
*  But they are not made here. They're from china or other foreign markets liberty safes are made [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2530.32s)]
*  In the united states for over 30 years liberty has made its safes right here [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2536.48s)]
*  And that matters because when you buy a liberty safe for supporting american workers and american values [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2540.64s)]
*  Their products are more than just a place to protect your dead shotguns. For example, they are a symbol of this country [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2546.1600000000003s)]
*  So celebrate this historic moment secure the things that you want to keep forever in a liberty safe [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2551.84s)]

*  Made in america. Let me ask you a question [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2566.1600000000003s)]
*  That for some reason seemed to have sunk beneath the waves [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2569.76s)]
*  The the jfk story 62 years ago the president's murdered. It's pretty clear that the story we were told isn't true [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2572.4s)]
*  and [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2580.1600000000003s)]
*  It bothers people because it gets to a core question, which is is the president? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2581.2000000000003s)]
*  Like capable of making independent decisions or is there a threat of physical violence? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2586.0s)]
*  against all american presidents [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2592.0s)]
*  That persists [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2594.56s)]
*  Well, we know there's a threat of violence because we just watched our president get shot in the head. Of course, but from some [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2596.32s)]
*  Organ from whatever group [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2602.16s)]
*  Has been able to keep these files secret for 62 years. So my question to you is like, what is that? [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2606.08s)]
*  Why have these been secret for so long? I look [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2610.08s)]
*  You know the idea of the deep state to me is a convenience more than it is a reality [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2612.72s)]
*  Um, it's a boogeyman [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2619.04s)]
*  Uh, why don't they put it out because institutions protect themselves talker as we both know really and there is clearly [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2621.12s)]
*  Information in those files that are going to make the cia look bad just the cia. Well, whatever different agencies. No, not whatever. I mean, let's [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2628.06s)]
*  I mean, I don't know because I haven't seen it. Okay. Well, so here's could be the fbi could be cia [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2635.52s)]
*  Okay, so i've always thought that [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2639.44s)]
*  And then in january, you know, there was a scramble over who's going to get what jobs in the new administration [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2641.68s)]
*  And at one point there was someone who was being discussed [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2646.64s)]
*  Uh for a job in the intel world and a member of the ssci the senate select committee on intelligence and intel committee [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2649.7799999999997s)]
*  went [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2658.3399999999997s)]
*  To the people making the decision and said you cannot hire this person because this person will be certain [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2659.7s)]
*  To push for the release of the jfk files. So this is in this fact. So this is in 2025 [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2664.5s)]
*  less than two months ago [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2670.74s)]
*  And you have a sitting member of the united states senate whose main goal is to keep [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2672.58s)]
*  Those files secret and then you have to ask yourself why yeah exactly why? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2678.98s)]
*  Why were they even alive? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2684.18s)]
*  Of course this no one was alive. I was 62 years ago [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2686.2599999999998s)]
*  And by the way the institution no one can even tell you who the cia director was and who do you name the cia director? [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2689.14s)]
*  john mccone, I think [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2694.98s)]
*  1963 but that person is like completely lost to history except a specialist so [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2697.04s)]
*  And the cia has already been through 50 years ago the church committee hearings 1975 where we sort of know that they're [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2700.82s)]
*  Sassing people dosing people with acid all the stuff. It's like the cia has already been discredited [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2705.9399999999996s)]
*  so if you're telling me that [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2711.46s)]
*  Six weeks ago a member of the united states senate was trying to keep someone out of a job [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2714.1s)]
*  In order to keep these files secret that is to protect the cia [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2718.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't believe that for a second. So what do you think it is? I don't know but this is [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2722.02s)]
*  I mean, there's no one at the cia [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2727.3799999999997s)]
*  Who's involved then actually? Yeah, who's involved in the kennedy sessions? There's no one in america who's involved in the assassination [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2730.18s)]
*  So here's what I know [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2735.7s)]
*  First of all, I don't believe that the cia has been completely discredited. I believe in the institutions [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2737.46s)]
*  They have to be checked [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2741.9399999999996s)]
*  You know the media used to be in the business of checking the institutions now [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2742.8999999999996s)]
*  we're in the business of like defending them tacitly because we have a president that attacks them all the time, but [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2745.7799999999997s)]
*  the [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2751.8599999999997s)]
*  So mike pompeo gets in there. He's in charge of the cia trump says i'm releasing the files, okay [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2753.14s)]
*  Somebody says something to mike pompeo that he then goes to the president of the united states and says [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2758.74s)]
*  You can't release these things and trump acknowledges it now. Do I believe that trump did it under threat? [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2763.86s)]
*  No, uh, I think that trump just decided that whatever he was being told [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2771.06s)]
*  Made sense, but it's it's and i'm not even speaking of trump or pompeo is a very sinister person [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2776.1s)]
*  And you're absolutely right pompeo was the driver behind that but who was driving pompeo? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2781.06s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't actually make sense the story doesn't make sense. And by the way, we we have the file numbers [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2784.9s)]
*  Of most of the files that have not been disclosed so it's like trump issues an executive order on january 23rd saying you're going to release this stuff [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2790.9s)]
*  They kind of can't not release it and yet now it's the first week of march and they haven't released it [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2797.7799999999997s)]
*  So pressure is currently being applied on the administration not to release those files. It seems that way by whom I don't know [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2803.38s)]
*  Some like mid-level analyst at cia who just doesn't want to discredit the institution he works for I don't think so [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2811.2999999999997s)]
*  Like what is that? I don't know who I don't believe it's the rockefellas the pope and no, I'm not [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2817.3799999999997s)]
*  Like I don't believe that i'm not even guessing all i'm saying is we can say with certainty [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2822.66s)]
*  That there is a force acting on these people [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2827.7799999999997s)]
*  A very serious force to the point where they're embarrassing themselves because they promise they didn't release this and they haven't look [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2831.06s)]
*  I don't I don't disagree with what the hell is that? I don't know but it's not just that right now [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2836.3399999999997s)]
*  We get this weird story about the epstein files like who even cares [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2841.14s)]
*  You know what I mean? Like who I I want released I believe in transparency. I think it's the route to trust [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2845.06s)]
*  And it's not just because i'm in the media. It's just common sense [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2850.5s)]
*  But ag bondi, I don't have any reason to be anti ag bondi [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2853.22s)]
*  And she says she's going to release the files and I don't even care that they released them to their pod people [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2857.14s)]
*  I mean, I thought that was stupid. But I mean, that's fine. They want to do what they do it. Um, they're playing to preference. Okay [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2862.1s)]
*  Now then there's a story about well the new york fbi they hid all the files and then [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2867.94s)]
*  We're gonna have to get them. We're gonna fire this guy who's supposedly by most accounts is a pretty solid guy that they they had quit [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2872.58s)]
*  Well, where are the files? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2879.22s)]
*  Where are they and because I thought trump was the antidote to this and to me the heartbreak has already come and gone [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2881.14s)]
*  UFOs to me [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2888.64s)]
*  Is the best example of what you're picking up and I totally agree. I just want to just linger for one second on the epstein things [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2890.5s)]
*  So what is that? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2897.7799999999997s)]
*  I mean once again, you clearly have a force that's applying [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2899.46s)]
*  measurable pressure [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2904.16s)]
*  On the people who should have the power the elected president of state should have the power under our system [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2906.1s)]
*  That's called democracy and his appointees [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2910.58s)]
*  Have derivative power from him [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2913.86s)]
*  But they appear to be powerless in the face of some other source of power and the question is what is that source? [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2915.94s)]
*  I don't know and where's your boy cash patel. I mean he went in there to supposedly bust all this up [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2920.9s)]
*  I can't answer that he put out this weird tweet, you know [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2925.86s)]
*  That was very general like, you know things are gonna change and we're gonna do this and after we learn that someone under his control [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2929.2200000000003s)]
*  Now right because he's the head of the fbi [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2936.42s)]
*  In that office that's under him [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2938.9s)]
*  Why wasn't he there? Why didn't he go there and say give me the files give them to me? [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2941.7000000000003s)]
*  Weren't you just saying the deep states not real? [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2944.98s)]
*  I don't know. I don't believe in the deep state as a boogeyman going on. But look, they're his guys [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2947.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm just saying why didn't he go there and say give me the files? So let's let's just use logic [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2951.6200000000003s)]
*  I can't answer that question. I think it's a great question [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2955.7799999999997s)]
*  But i'm let's just use logic for one second [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2958.5s)]
*  Clearly if you watch this in my case for the same as you 35 years watching this stuff carefully and somebody you know [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2961.6s)]
*  Gets in office i'm gonna do this at the other thing and then like five days later. They're like, well actually [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2968.02s)]
*  Someone has called that person to say [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2972.9s)]
*  There's something you didn't know [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2975.62s)]
*  Hear the consequences of doing that someone has applied [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2977.7799999999997s)]
*  very serious pressure on this person pressure so serious that that person is willing to [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2980.9s)]
*  Humiliate himself. So wait a minute. Here's the part. I don't know who's that person exerting the pressure, but you [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2985.7799999999997s)]
*  Are uniquely qualified to get this answer because one of us can call the president of the united states right now and ask him [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2991.2999999999997s)]
*  And the other one is me. So why don't you know I have um, that's a great question [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=2999.8599999999997s)]
*  It's the only kind I asked so what I what I brought to it was the knowledge that a member of the senate intel committee [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3005.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm not guessing [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3010.98s)]
*  Called over and said you cannot appoint this person [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3012.34s)]
*  So why don't you expose that person first of all so we can start chasing tom cotton of arkansas did that [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3014.5s)]
*  Tom cotton. Yes, correct. And did you ask him? I haven't no I haven't asked him. What the hell's going on with you? [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3019.46s)]
*  I'd like to um [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3025.0600000000004s)]
*  and [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3027.1400000000003s)]
*  Kind of makes people suspicious of you by the way [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3029.38s)]
*  Go ahead because if you know if you know that tom cotton said you can't pick this person [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3031.86s)]
*  That is correct. And then you didn't go to him and find out why [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3037.3s)]
*  Well, I need to sit down with him. I'm not sure that he'll do an interview with me [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3041.2200000000003s)]
*  With you i'm waiting you are you are you are like the spirit animal of that administration [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3044.7400000000002s)]
*  But it's it's a fair look. It's a fair question. Um, that's a totally fair question [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3050.82s)]
*  And the answer is I hadn't thought to do that and there's a lot going on and i've been [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3054.82s)]
*  Distracted and i've kind of been now. I think you're part of the deep state [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3060.5600000000004s)]
*  And just like that think that I I probably wouldn't be saying any of this. I was part of the deep unless [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3063.7000000000003s)]
*  That's what they would do is make me think that it exists [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3068.58s)]
*  But you're not sure because it's actually you one of the worst things that ever happened to me ever is last year when I was [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3071.94s)]
*  interviewing putin [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3078.16s)]
*  It was such a long interview and it was being translated and I couldn't always hear the translation very well [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3079.62s)]
*  And apparently in it he says you applied to work at cia which I did, you know, i'm not hiding that I didn't get in [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3084.2599999999998s)]
*  Um, and and your father worked for the intel world and all I didn't hear him say that I did not hear him say that [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3090.42s)]
*  And [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3096.74s)]
*  I have been living with that ever since I have nothing to do with any of that for whatever it's worth [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3097.7s)]
*  But the number of people have texted me but like oh you're working with this. Yeah, it's like [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3102.2599999999998s)]
*  No, actually nobody believes more strongly in radical reform at cia than I do with I would say some knowledge of the subject [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3106.1s)]
*  um [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3113.86s)]
*  Look, I mean people can think I work for the deep state. I I don't I don't think there is a deep state [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3115.06s)]
*  Here's all i'm saying someone is applying massive pressure [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3120.34s)]
*  To elected officials and has for a very long time and I would like to know who that is [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3123.8599999999997s)]
*  Ask mike pompeo why he told oh I have oh I have and when I got into it with mike pump [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3128.02s)]
*  No, I mean I I've talked about this before. I don't want to be boring, but I when [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3133.3799999999997s)]
*  I tell you to ask dan crincho, but he's not going to take no. He's not he's not going to call him a liberal, but you wonder [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3138.1s)]
*  dan crincho's [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3144.58s)]
*  Dan crincho is emotionally out of control and and I feel for I honestly I've not stopped provoking him then [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3146.8199999999997s)]
*  I I didn't even provoke him. I just pointed it out. I just pointed out [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3152.66s)]
*  Um you provoked him. I saw it on stage. His state was just invaded by mexico and he's worried about ukraine [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3157.7s)]
*  It's like what wake up son. Here are your duties. Let me put them in order to your family [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3163.62s)]
*  To your community to your voters to your state to your nation and maybe ukraine down there at the bottom [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3169.3s)]
*  But anyway, that's all I was saying. Here's my point, please [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3173.7s)]
*  I [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3177.3s)]
*  am really [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3178.34s)]
*  Concerned not just because you know, I am curious and I want to get to the bottom of mysteries, which is true [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3180.4s)]
*  But i'm really concerned that the failure to disclose big things like details about the murder of a president in a democratic [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3186.6600000000003s)]
*  democratic country republic [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3194.26s)]
*  That that will convince people that our system itself is fake [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3196.82s)]
*  And it's kind of hard to argue that it's real. I totally agree if you can't even know [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3201.2200000000003s)]
*  Who killed the president transparency is trust 62 years later [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3205.46s)]

*  Who are you working for my and we just had an election. What is that? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3213.3s)]
*  And by the way, I just want to say one time you cannot convince me [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3216.5800000000004s)]
*  I'm not some world expert in the cia, but i've certainly watched it closely over the years [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3219.46s)]
*  It's not the cia the cia [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3223.46s)]
*  cia is like a huge federal agency with all kinds of different components and warring tribes within and like there's no [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3225.7000000000003s)]
*  ci bill burns [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3232.5800000000004s)]
*  Um is not like calling [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3235.3s)]
*  I don't know trump and being like don't release the files. I agree just credit cia [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3238.26s)]
*  But look the president knows we just had an election where he was hammering on these things and even with uaps or ufos [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3242.1000000000004s)]
*  Whatever terminology you want [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3248.9s)]
*  We couldn't get more information. These things are all over the place. Sure. Some are helicopters. Some are fixed wing [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3250.98s)]
*  Okay, not all of them [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3256.6600000000003s)]
*  And they don't know of course they know they spend hundreds of millions of dollars on the programs and then we get all our hopes up [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3258.82s)]
*  Right. The media loves mocking news nation about this because they think that [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3265.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh cuomo thinks they're little green men in the basement of some building [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3269.7000000000003s)]
*  No, I don't [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3273.38s)]
*  It's about knowing that we spend hundreds of millions of dollars and use special operators [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3274.6600000000003s)]
*  To do things that you won't tell us about and at a minimum you should say well, here's why we won't tell you [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3279.78s)]
*  So what are they? [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3285.46s)]
*  That's exactly right. Well, so but what are they do you think? I don't know what the fuck they are [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3286.7400000000002s)]
*  The point is that they know [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3290.9s)]
*  And they won't tell us things and I think it is anathema to democracy [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3293.06s)]
*  Can I of course I agree with everything you're saying except one specific point, which is i'm not sure they know [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3297.62s)]
*  They have programmed they certainly know more than we do put it that way they do [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3303.54s)]
*  Um, they may know that they don't really know which is the scariest thing of all [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3307.14s)]
*  And i've certainly called a lot on this topic. I've stopped talking about it in public. I've tried to stop thinking about it [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3311.46s)]
*  um, because it's just one of the things that drives you crazy, but um, my strong impression is [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3317.06s)]
*  That that they don't really know that there isn't a consensus on this and that they're not [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3322.66s)]
*  You know from russia or china he campaigned on it [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3327.46s)]
*  It was supposed to be a no-brainer and then they put out exactly what the biden organization. No, i'm i'm aware of that [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3330.02s)]
*  administration i'm aware of that and [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3335.06s)]
*  i'm aware of that [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3337.94s)]
*  Do you think I mean that's just my view I could be completely wrong [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3339.38s)]
*  But I I don't think it's as simple as they know exactly what's going on and they're hiding it [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3342.2599999999998s)]
*  Well again, these are your people why don't you talk to them? They love you. Oh my gosh. I have [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3346.1s)]
*  And so what do you got for me? I come all the way down here. We don't we don't cross all these bridges [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3350.1000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's kind of the scarier answer is flying over military bases [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3354.7400000000002s)]
*  Shutting them down and you're shutting shutting down military and you don't shoot them down [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3359.6200000000003s)]
*  And then figure out what it was. Well, maybe you can't you know, so that's [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3364.02s)]
*  so look, I mean, I think we're getting to the same answer if [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3369.3s)]
*  If there is a very obvious mystery that's publicly known there's public pressure to solve the mystery to divulge what you know [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3373.86s)]
*  And you don't yes, then there's there's a real reason behind it [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3379.2999999999997s)]
*  It's not just ass-covering or do you have the arrogance to believe that you don't have to tell me? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3382.98s)]
*  No, not anymore. Not anymore because [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3388.2599999999998s)]
*  Now that you know, especially in this administration that was elected on the promise of transparency. There's there's a real reason [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3391.2999999999997s)]
*  Because there's tons of counter pressure people are aware like where the hell are my kennedy files? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3398.2599999999998s)]
*  What's going on these things over new jersey? You said they were over your house in bedminster [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3402.4199999999996s)]
*  What is it, you know, and what is this epstein thing which all of us watched [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3407.2400000000002s)]
*  george stefanopoulos is having dinner with everyone, you know is over at epstein's house like [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3411.6400000000003s)]
*  Ehud barak is there every day like what the hell is this? [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3415.5600000000004s)]
*  Who killed this guy? He was clearly killed obviously. He wasn't commit suicide. Look just start there show us the files [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3418.76s)]
*  that [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3426.1200000000003s)]
*  Substantiated the theory of his suicide [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3427.6200000000003s)]
*  Just show him to us. Where's your investigation into his death? [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3430.52s)]
*  Which you promised attorney general bar that you're gonna do show us and you never did yeah [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3433.0s)]
*  So I guess what i'm saying is if you take three steps back, you're like wait [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3437.8s)]
*  This really is this isn't just you know [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3441.08s)]
*  Maybe some of the details are wrong or certainly stories like this draw all the wackos like a bug light for sure and they come up [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3442.76s)]
*  With these fantastical theories to explain it but just the the knowable facts that confirm facts suggest something really really big [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3448.04s)]
*  like [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3456.36s)]
*  The moment that I never thought much about the epstein story until I realized that the that the republican two-time republican [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3457.32s)]
*  attorney general bar [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3463.0s)]
*  Uh lied about it. I thought why would bar lie about this epstein's a big democratic donor [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3464.84s)]
*  Bar was not close to trump. He's not covering for trump [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3471.24s)]
*  What is that? And I don't know the answer but that was the moment where I was like, whoa [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3474.28s)]
*  All of a sudden bill crystal's lawyer is involved in this which he was [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3478.36s)]
*  You know, I don't know. There's just a lot there's a lot there [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3483.72s)]
*  there's so much there that it starts to make you nervous and it makes you think like [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3485.8s)]
*  Maybe the it's not just that things are screwed up on the margins, but maybe at the core is something really dark [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3489.96s)]
*  I don't know. I don't either because look this is the problem with the vacuum of information, right? Is that you then start [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3496.6s)]
*  Speculating about why they won't just tell you these things [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3503.54s)]
*  And and i'm not i'm not going to speculate on it because I don't I don't know [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3506.68s)]
*  And I don't even have like really good theories. I do have some theories, but they could be completely wrong [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3511.0s)]
*  All i'm saying is [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3515.48s)]
*  A rational person arrives inevitably at the conclusion that there's a real reason these have not been discussed. It's not just entropy [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3517.32s)]
*  I have a conspiracy theory about it. I'm not so sure anymore [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3524.68s)]
*  So we love the word patriot, okay, we love it. We love to say that we're patriots [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3530.28s)]
*  I don't know [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3536.28s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know anymore when I look at the trump administration [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3537.64s)]
*  I'm not accusing anybody of anything [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3541.8s)]
*  treasonous [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3545.22s)]
*  I'm just saying there seems to be a lot of currency these days in destroying things [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3546.44s)]
*  And i've never seen a president [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3550.92s)]
*  in our lifetime [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3554.12s)]
*  Say that everything in government is bad [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3556.52s)]
*  Trump is the only president even his speech which I thought was well written and well delivered for what he wanted to try to achieve [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3560.12s)]
*  Which is hey, I got a lot of balls in the air [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3566.68s)]
*  I know forget about me promising what would happen day one stuff's going to get worse before it gets better kind of vibe [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3568.92s)]
*  Which I get why he wanted that speech given what's happening in the polls [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3574.84s)]
*  but [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3578.7599999999998s)]
*  Justice doesn't work the elections don't work [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3580.36s)]
*  wall street is uh corrupt [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3583.96s)]
*  Uh, none of the institutions of government can do everything all the tax dollars are wasted [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3587.16s)]
*  It's like I keep getting the same message from them and musk to me [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3592.12s)]
*  Has been a huge disappointment. I don't I believe the man is a genius. Okay, he has done remarkable things [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3597.08s)]
*  He doesn't know that the federal judiciary is able to check the executive [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3604.52s)]
*  He doesn't know that social security the trust fund isn't part of our debt structure [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3609.64s)]
*  I can't believe a genius doesn't know these things. So then why would he be messaging this way unless [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3615.48s)]
*  He doesn't want people to like the justice system. He doesn't like people to want social security [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3620.92s)]
*  He doesn't want them to believe that government can do anything [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3626.12s)]
*  And I don't understand that as a political message from a guy who's in charge of everything now [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3629.4s)]
*  And what is underlying it in terms of your real ambition? Well, I think I can answer some of them. Um [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3634.84s)]
*  I think elon, you know builds electric cars and rockets and tunneling equipment and telecom [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3641.0s)]
*  You know satellite-based telecom, etc. Etc. He's a builder of things. He's a businessman. He's an engineer [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3648.68s)]
*  Um, you know, i'm not surprised. He doesn't know the details of how social security is structured at all [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3654.04s)]
*  And i'm not surprised that as a naturalized american [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3659.64s)]
*  He's not you know, didn't grow up a schoolhouse rock and doesn't understand the three branches perfectly [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3662.28s)]
*  His job from what I can tell is to deal with the one thing that nobody has dealt with [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3668.76s)]
*  Which is which will be the end of the country, which is the country's bankruptcy [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3673.6400000000003s)]
*  So the debt is what? [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3678.0400000000004s)]
*  37.6.9 something like 37 trillion [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3680.42s)]
*  Uh revenues last year [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3684.6800000000003s)]
*  2024 total federal revenues were under five trillion [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3687.6200000000003s)]
*  Okay, so [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3691.64s)]
*  That's that doesn't work and at a certain point, you know [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3693.16s)]
*  The people who are floating the country the bond buyers the foreign bond buyers like i'm not you know, this doesn't [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3695.7999999999997s)]
*  And everything will collapse and that's been known for a long time [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3700.8399999999997s)]
*  No one has dealt with it and from what I can tell [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3705.48s)]
*  Uh elon's job is to try and get the spending down and no one's been able to do that [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3708.44s)]
*  Well get the spending down has to be in the budgeting process to me. It's a penny wise pound foolish [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3714.04s)]
*  Uh notion i'm okay with getting rid of waste waste fraud and abuse you and I grew up [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3719.72s)]
*  Listening to both parties argue when the other one was in power that there was all this waste fraud and abuse [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3724.68s)]
*  And you had to curtail it and i'm I know it's true. It's always been true [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3729.72s)]
*  Nobody has ever looked for it and failed to find it. I'm okay with them doing that [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3734.04s)]
*  But i'll tell you what if they had called up carlson and cuomo and said [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3737.56s)]
*  Would you guys like to serve your country and uh, see what you can find in terms of waste fraud and abuse? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3742.28s)]
*  And we said yes, i'll tell you what we wouldn't do [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3747.64s)]
*  is [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3750.92s)]
*  Keep going off half cocked [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3752.92s)]
*  Every day about what we were finding when we weren't sure [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3755.72s)]
*  We would not do that. We would have immediately come to an agreement. Yeah, we'd probably let's look [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3759.56s)]
*  Let's find stuff [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3764.36s)]
*  Okay, and then we're gonna go to congress and we're gonna say look at all this shit we found [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3766.04s)]
*  And because we don't trust them we would then go public with it at well at the same time [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3771.08s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that's I we would have a blue ribbon commission and we present our findings [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3774.84s)]
*  But he is going off half cocked none of that's worked and I feel like [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3778.1200000000003s)]
*  look [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3782.36s)]
*  We don't know if it's gonna work or not [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3783.88s)]
*  I'm praying that it does because I think it's our last chance i'm fine with it working. I want it to work [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3785.7200000000003s)]
*  I feel like he's working against his own goals by getting things wrong all the time maybe but big picture. He's right [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3790.52s)]
*  So usaid which I grew up around in washington [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3797.2400000000002s)]
*  You know, I really grew up around it [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3801.0s)]
*  I can just tell you firsthand having seen it. It is a force for evil in the world [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3803.4s)]
*  I think it does probably good things on the margins, but bottom line it is destabilizing other governments [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3807.72s)]
*  It's a form of the ugliest kind of imperialism totally detached from american interests. It's like really bad [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3812.84s)]
*  And the more you know, that's why it's so shocking to read it all the more indefensible it becomes the secretary of state disagrees with you [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3817.72s)]
*  He may or may not i'm just saying, you know, he's from miami i'm from dc [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3824.84s)]
*  So I just tell you I have I think deep exposure to this and there's no doubt by the way usaid aid gets zeroed out [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3829.0s)]
*  How many third world presidents complained about that? Did you see any being like? Oh my gosh, we want our aid [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3837.48s)]
*  They don't want american aid in that form because it destabilizes democratic governments. It overturns the culture of the country [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3842.44s)]
*  Oh, you need more trans athletes [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3849.7200000000003s)]
*  They hate it and there's nothing they can do about it [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3852.2000000000003s)]
*  I don't think a single foreign president in a poor country complained when we shut off that aid because they didn't want it [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3854.28s)]
*  So that tells you right there [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3860.1200000000003s)]
*  Now that's a minuscule part of the entire federal budget agreed and he just happened to start with the agency that's investigating him [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3861.96s)]
*  I I don't think usaid has an investigative arm. Okay, they do. Okay. Well, whatever elon's being, you know attacked on many sides [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3869.0800000000004s)]
*  This was before anything happened. Okay [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3876.6000000000004s)]
*  I'm just saying you and I wouldn't have picked an agency that was looking into one of us without letting people know that [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3878.52s)]
*  I'm not even aware. Why didn't he tell us big picture? [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3883.08s)]
*  The government [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3887.0s)]
*  Is strangling the country. I don't think there's any doubt about that. What does that mean? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3888.52s)]
*  It means that the richest place in the united states is the one place that produces nothing but bureaucratic jobs dc [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3892.2000000000003s)]
*  It's the richest place and it's the highest concentration of wealth in the in the united states [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3898.84s)]
*  The counties around dc are the richest they're like the majority of the top 10 are in dc and all that money is federal money [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3903.0s)]
*  None of those people can ever be fired or are [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3909.4s)]
*  It's not even clear what they're doing. A lot of their budgets are classified the intel eic [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3911.96s)]
*  It's like all you don't even know what they're spending. They own businesses around the world. This is a fact [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3916.44s)]
*  I mean they'll admit it if you ask them [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3921.08s)]
*  And basically there's no democratic control over any of this the voters have no say [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3923.08s)]
*  In how this money is spent and the people spending it are beyond any kind of correction [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3927.8s)]
*  There's nothing you can do about it. And so it's it's truly out of control in a way that makes democracy impossible [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3932.52s)]
*  And it's also their acting and strong interest so um, and then there's the debt overhang which [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3938.44s)]
*  Really threatens in an imminent way to make all these conversations just irrelevant [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3943.2400000000002s)]
*  If we're a poor country, they can't support, you know a military and can't [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3947.56s)]
*  Keep up with our own infrastructure then like none of this stuff even matters. So do you believe that the answer is to [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3952.12s)]
*  Uh change the institutions to destroy the institutions. What do you think the answer is? [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3958.6s)]
*  Everybody loves and appreciates first responders when things go [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3963.88s)]
*  Haywire they're the ones who show up and make you safe protect you not just you but the entire country [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3968.36s)]
*  Most people agree they're heroes [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3974.6s)]
*  But what happens if they can't show up first responders cannot be everywhere all the time [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3976.92s)]
*  And if there's an emergency particularly a big emergency there aren't enough to go around [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3983.48s)]
*  So you have to be your own first responder before an ambulance arrives for a doctor can help it is up to you to protect [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3987.7999999999997s)]
*  Yourself and your family and if it's a medical emergency [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3994.2s)]
*  You could be out of luck because you don't have the right medications. Most people do not have the medications they need at home [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=3997.0s)]
*  There's an answer to that. It's called the jace case. It's a simple but smart solution to a problem [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4004.2799999999997s)]
*  Most people don't even think about it. It's a set of emergency prescriptive [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4008.52s)]
*  Medications curated by medical experts [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4012.98s)]
*  You've got peace of mind knowing that no matter what happens you are totally prepared [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4015.24s)]
*  Even if you're a prepared kind of person with stuff stored in your cellar, you probably don't have the right medications [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4020.52s)]
*  what if there's an infection [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4027.24s)]
*  or any kind of crisis and you don't have access to first responders you're going to want a jace case medications on hand [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4029.56s)]
*  When they matter most go to jace [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4037.64s)]
*  Dot com and use code tucker at checkout for a discount jace jase.com check out code tucker [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4040.92s)]
*  so [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4048.84s)]
*  My sense is that you're not going to get anywhere [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4051.1600000000003s)]
*  Unless well, and I think this was their calculation [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4054.84s)]
*  You come out [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4058.28s)]
*  like a freaking wild animal out of a box [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4059.5600000000004s)]
*  So fast so hard that you intimidate the shit out of everyone into silence [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4063.32s)]
*  Long enough that you gain momentum to continue the process of paring back government, but you really have to [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4069.0s)]
*  Immediately occupy the moral high ground you need to you can't like get into debate with benny thompson over, you know [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4075.4s)]
*  funding of this or that agency you really have to [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4082.84s)]
*  Get up here and look down at benny thompson say I can't believe that you're participating in this scam for decades [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4085.8s)]
*  That hurt this country impoverished its citizens. You did this [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4091.88s)]
*  And it's only from that posture that you have any power to negotiate the reforms necessary [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4096.12s)]
*  You sort of have to do what the trans lobby the human rights campaign did [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4101.16s)]
*  Which is you sort of come out of nowhere and rather than sort of make the case that hey don't beat up trans kids [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4105.08s)]
*  Which i'm for don't beat up trans kids or anybody [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4109.639999999999s)]
*  They come out and they're like you're a transphobe [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4113.24s)]
*  We're gonna picket your house and kill you if you say anything and people are like holy shit [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4115.16s)]
*  they're so intimidated that they just kind of go along with your program, I think [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4119.32s)]
*  I think a [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4122.84s)]
*  Functional country doesn't operate that way [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4124.92s)]
*  But this is not a functional country. This is a country that is like more dysfunctional than we will admit to ourselves [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4127.08s)]
*  And that may be the only option for reform, but I one thing that I think no one no honest person can disagree with [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4133.08s)]
*  We need reform like immediately on every level our military needs to be reformed [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4139.16s)]
*  The budgeting process needs to be reformed the way that our economy is structured [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4143.400000000001s)]
*  Clearly benefits just a tiny percentage of the population. That's not sustainable, etc [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4148.280000000001s)]
*  Etc. Like we need reform badly. We can't keep doing it this way. Well, we've been saying that a long time [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4152.2s)]
*  I know and trump is the first and again, I don't know if it's gonna work [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4156.92s)]
*  I'm praying that it will because it's this country is the last hope of the world. I really believe that more than ever [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4160.5199999999995s)]
*  Having just come back from other countries, right? [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4165.5599999999995s)]
*  That's why we have to make our kids travel because everybody thinks america is the worst place in the world until you go somewhere else [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4167.96s)]
*  Dude, yes, you know the thing that we need to preserve i'm more convinced [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4175.08s)]
*  That's why i'm a little worried about all the bashing of our institutions reform sure [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4178.44s)]
*  Do it better do it differently do it less do it more whatever it is. Sure, but the idea that [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4183.88s)]
*  There is no more justice in america. I don't believe that [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4190.12s)]
*  There all the elections are rigged. I don't believe that [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4193.24s)]
*  um, you know, we can't function it's demonstrably false so [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4196.92s)]
*  Making things better is fine [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4201.719999999999s)]
*  If you have the ideas and the wherewithal to make it happen, but what i'm sensing from this administration [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4203.8s)]
*  is [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4210.12s)]
*  It's all broken tear it all down [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4212.04s)]
*  And that's easy to say [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4214.6s)]
*  But I don't know that it's good [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4217.64s)]
*  Well, it's actually easy to do it's easy to tear things down [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4219.64s)]
*  Much easier than it is to build them and you want to be careful of revolutionary moments. I mean very few improve things [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4223.24s)]
*  Ours did I think in this country 250 years ago very few others did I can't really think of any that did well [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4229.72s)]
*  We had an oppressive force, you know, interestingly and this is something i'm very anxious for you to explain to me [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4234.6s)]
*  So I get fired and i'm watching the ukraine war [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4240.84s)]
*  And it was personally maddening to me because I had not not covered a conflict since I got involved in the business [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4243.96s)]
*  So i'm watching the whole country's behind ukraine. When did you get fired? Um right there like 20 21 [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4251.32s)]
*  When did I get fine? Yeah, so right when the ukraine war broke out [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4256.44s)]
*  I was fired and it was very it was a real reinforcer to me about how [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4259.799999999999s)]
*  Much I had lost right? But anyway, I was much more concerned about what was happening in ukraine [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4263.96s)]
*  So everyone's on board their blue and yellow ribbons all over my name. I was not on board at all [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4268.12s)]
*  Well, the country was the republicans were and the democrats. Yes [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4272.839999999999s)]
*  and I kept hearing [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4276.28s)]
*  Boy, you know, it's like they're kind of like us, you know [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4278.759999999999s)]
*  They're fighting against this oppressor and trying to shut it off so they can be their own way and get away from the kleptocracy [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4280.5199999999995s)]
*  And everything else [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4284.92s)]
*  And then trump has that bad phone call [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4286.28s)]
*  With zelensky leads to an impeachment that I thought was a complete waste of time [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4289.08s)]
*  You were never going to remove them and it's a political operation. So I didn't know why they did it [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4292.6s)]
*  But that's their choice. They went their way [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4297.0s)]
*  Then biden comes in [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4300.6s)]
*  Everybody's still doing what they were doing to try to help ukraine. Biden is slow walking it not giving them what they needed [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4302.4400000000005s)]
*  The wrong kind of ambivalence [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4310.04s)]
*  Now trump comes back and all of a sudden [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4312.12s)]
*  All the people who are in favor of ukraine on the right now say that it's a kleptocracy and zelensky is a bad guy [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4314.5199999999995s)]
*  And putin, you know, not so bad russia [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4320.92s)]
*  Not so bad. Uh, their concerns about nato pretty justified. It's really nato and america [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4324.36s)]
*  that [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4329.88s)]
*  Has done the wrong thing here and forced russia's hand and and ukraine and zelensky kind of did too and they're really dirty [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4331.0s)]
*  And they're stealing all our money and selling all our stuff [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4336.92s)]
*  I don't believe [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4339.88s)]
*  Any of it and I hear it all the time [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4342.12s)]
*  You are a big purveyor of this and I want to understand it. How did everything change this way? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4345.32s)]
*  Well, it changed because politicians in general with some exceptions [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4350.92s)]
*  But not many have no principles at all and they do what's popular what they think is popular [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4355.4s)]
*  and they respond just to [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4359.8s)]
*  One stimulus which is election. That's it. And if they think something will get them reelected [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4361.88s)]
*  They'll say it and if they don't they won't [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4366.2s)]
*  And so they're just I mean that's just what they are I don't think it's even worth being mad, I mean they're like [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4368.5199999999995s)]
*  animals whose [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4374.2s)]
*  Behavior is really predictable or machines, you know [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4375.32s)]
*  You can program to do a certain thing and you know, it's going to do that thing every time [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4377.5599999999995s)]
*  So the fact that like these guys are standing up being like, oh, you know [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4380.5199999999995s)]
*  Zelensky who was my blood brother last week is now a bad guy. Like of course they're saying that [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4383.24s)]
*  I've said the same thing I think since day one [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4387.72s)]
*  Which is this is not in our interest at all and we've really hurt ourselves and we've dislodged the dollar [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4389.88s)]
*  From its preeminence and that has consequences people are not thinking through [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4396.360000000001s)]
*  And russia, of course has an interest in what happens in ukraine. And of course they don't want [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4400.84s)]
*  American missiles on their border anymore than we'd want chinese missiles in tijuana. Like that's of course, of course, that's a real thing [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4406.4400000000005s)]
*  And moreover the thing that you want if you're thinking big and you should if you run america [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4413.8s)]
*  The thing you fear most is the alignment of russia with china because then you unite the world's largest country [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4418.4400000000005s)]
*  The largest nuclear arsenal with the world's largest economy and the world's largest population and that becomes a block [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4424.360000000001s)]
*  That many others gravitate to we're calling it the bricks now [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4429.400000000001s)]
*  and that becomes [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4433.0s)]
*  You know something that you can't resist that controls global trade routes that controls global currency [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4434.52s)]
*  And that reduces you the united states to the bitch position very fast understand but even within that the premise is [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4439.08s)]
*  Russia bad [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4446.6s)]
*  china potentially bad [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4447.88s)]
*  What does bad even mean I mean like russia bad means they are consistently invested in what's bad for america [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4450.36s)]
*  Putin is a concept. Well, they certainly are now. I mean, they're alive with china. So yeah [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4457.72s)]
*  That was not true at the beginning of 2022 [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4463.24s)]
*  And so I was invading ukraine [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4466.36s)]
*  Was wrong what they did and ukraine did not start that war the whole thing was wrong. No russia invaded ukraine [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4469.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes for one specific reason despite all the lying from an apple bomb and the atlantic council and the professional liars and morons in washington [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4476.92s)]
*  Who got us into the iraq war and libyan syria and every other disaster i've never apologized or been penalized for it [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4484.52s)]
*  the truth is that [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4490.12s)]
*  Russia's concern was that ukraine remain not part of nato they want to control ukraine [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4492.12s)]
*  To some extent it's their neighbor in the same way that we want to control. I don't know canada or mexico. You don't have to [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4497.88s)]
*  You know run the municipal elections in the country [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4504.12s)]
*  But you don't want like if you had a government in canada that was like [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4507.08s)]
*  Bent on destroying the united states you would overthrow the premier of canada because you can't have that. It's your neighbor [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4511.32s)]
*  You're a great power [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4515.799999999999s)]
*  And that's how russia sees itself now. You could say well that's against international law or whatever [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4517.4s)]
*  But that's the way nations behave and great nations have an expectation [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4521.48s)]
*  They're not going to have an enemy on their border if they can help it but nato [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4524.5199999999995s)]
*  Isn't inherently an enemy it is to it is to protect against [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4527.799999999999s)]
*  the [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4533.5599999999995s)]
*  illegal and wrongful annexation of sovereigns, okay, it's okay ukraine is not sovereign and ukraine's government was installed [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4534.42s)]
*  In a coup by the cia in 2014. So it's not a sovereign nation. Well, the ukraine's regime [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4542.599999999999s)]
*  We installed their government. They're not sovereign. You ukraine is a sovereign as you know, but what way russia had put a puppet in [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4549.32s)]
*  There was a democratic [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4557.32s)]
*  Revolution there that zelensky wound up winning that election second round of voting [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4559.48s)]
*  That was to remove the russian puppet who went back with a lot of money into russia. No, you're you're [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4565.24s)]
*  Yeah, whatever. I mean you're skipping over that's actually not at all what happened [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4573.08s)]
*  Zelensky did not become president in 2014, which was when my no, but i'm saying that's [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4575.96s)]
*  Maidan square was a reaction to a russian puppet regime in that country [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4581.0s)]
*  Well, that's what they were against a russian puppet regime. Where did the guy go back to? [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4585.16s)]
*  Well, he fled to russia. Yeah on the verge of getting killed [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4589.16s)]
*  but the bottom line is [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4593.16s)]
*  Russia wanted a friendly government in ukraine. Okay, I get it [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4595.320000000001s)]
*  The united states which is nowhere near russia or ukraine went across the atlantic ocean to install its president in ukraine in a coup [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4600.360000000001s)]
*  That's a fact and they were caught on tape doing it [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4608.84s)]
*  And bob kagan's wife was uh, was caught doing that [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4611.96s)]
*  Um, you can listen to the tape and so [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4616.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, I guess both are bad [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4619.08s)]
*  But if you're being an adult about it, you understand that great powers have an interest in not having other people's nuclear weapons on their borders [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4621.0s)]
*  That's just a fact and you could say well, it shouldn't be a fact, but it is a fact [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4628.2s)]
*  So if you don't have nuclear weapons in you on you on the border the only nuclear weapon [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4631.64s)]
*  Well, the only really so nato doesn't have nuclear look in ukraine. No, okay [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4637.240000000001s)]
*  Their concern was and ukraine used to have a lot of nukes and they agreed to get rid of them on the basis of protection [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4643.160000000001s)]
*  From russia. Those were soviet nukes, right? That was negotiated by the united states, but right, okay [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4647.96s)]
*  All i'm saying is [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4655.080000000001s)]
*  If you're thinking about it from the perspective of what's good for the united states, you do not want russia becoming [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4656.68s)]
*  In close military alliance and economic alliance with china [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4663.400000000001s)]
*  You don't want that because that becomes a block that you can't defeat from which you will soon be taking orders [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4665.88s)]
*  And every administration has understood this the biden administration [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4671.32s)]
*  Went to the munich security conference in february of 2022 and had the vice president of the united states kamo harris [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4675.400000000001s)]
*  Say at a press conference to zelensk. We want you in nato nato did don't want ukraine [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4681.8s)]
*  There never was a referendum in ukraine what the ukrainians wanted [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4687.0s)]
*  We want you to be an american satellite with american weapons in your country. She said that knowing that was the red line putin's like look [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4690.84s)]
*  I just don't want ukraine in nato. That's it. You've had all these countries around my borders in nato [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4697.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know why you're doing that. I still don't know to this day why we're doing that. That's an aggressive offensive move [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4701.88s)]
*  But you cannot have ukraine. It's too big. It's too important. Our energy pipelines go through it. No [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4706.68s)]
*  And they insisted on doing this and putin gave a speech [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4712.4400000000005s)]
*  Immediately after in russia no americans ever watched it. You should it's really interesting saying [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4716.04s)]
*  This nato thing is too much. We have to invade and we're doing it. Those are the facts [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4721.0s)]
*  Okay, so the question is why would you do that? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4724.28s)]
*  Ukraine is not sovereign. It never was you know that ukraine cannot beat russia in a conventional war [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4728.12s)]
*  Russia's got a hundred million more people and much deeper [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4733.0s)]
*  But that doesn't mean you let them roll over and ukraine is a sovereign. It's its own country [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4735.639999999999s)]
*  In what sense are they making independent decisions? I'll give you in april of 2022 two months after this war starts very clear that [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4740.12s)]
*  That russia is going to win. It's it's just a much bigger country period [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4746.28s)]
*  And so the ukrainians and the russians start having peace talks [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4751.0s)]
*  And they move them around bunch of different places. They went up in istanbul turkey [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4754.84s)]
*  And they have a bunch of different [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4757.88s)]
*  Data points the first is no nato. The second is what do we do with kremia which since 2014 had been like russian aligned [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4760.92s)]
*  The whole separate converse by the way, they took it. They took it. What do you do with that? [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4768.12s)]
*  There's a russian military naval base there as you know [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4773.0s)]
*  And what do you do with donetsk and lugansk in the eastern part of ukraine they basically reached terms in istanbul [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4775.88s)]
*  Two months into the war all of a sudden [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4782.759999999999s)]
*  The former prime minister of great britain boris johnson shows up in kiev and delivers a message from the biden administration [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4785.719999999999s)]
*  No, no peace you are not allowed to negotiate a peace [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4791.799999999999s)]
*  This is he's telling a sovereign a quote sovereign country this some unemployed [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4795.48s)]
*  You know indebted brit is showing up on behalf of the united states to lecture the so-called president of ukraine about what he can do with his own country [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4799.82s)]
*  It's not sovereign in any sense and they break off [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4808.62s)]
*  The peace talks. This is all like i'm not making this up to look it up [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4812.14s)]
*  And a million more ukrainians died the country's totally destroyed forever [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4816.3s)]
*  And then zelensky goes and changes the law in ukraine to allow foreigners to buy farmland in ukraine to buy the soil of ukraine [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4820.94s)]
*  So you wind up with a country whose population has just been killed that no longer owns its land [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4828.3s)]
*  So big american companies multinational companies can go in is by ukraine [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4833.5s)]
*  That's the total destruction of a european nation [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4837.82s)]
*  And in the united states we feel like oh no, we're fighting on behalf of churchill. No, we just destroyed ukraine [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4841.179999999999s)]
*  Because we want to fight russia and now that is the core [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4846.7s)]
*  The desire of the american foreign policy established to have a war with russia that does not make any sense to me [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4849.66s)]
*  I'm not a putin lover or i've i don't speak russia. I've got nothing to do with russia [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4854.38s)]
*  I just don't understand why it's in america's national interest to be at war with russia. It's not [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4858.38s)]
*  And these are people with very deep [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4862.7s)]
*  Emotional hatred of russia. I can't even speculate as to where that comes from [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4865.320000000001s)]
*  But it's real i've certainly seen it a lot [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4868.860000000001s)]
*  And it's not consistent with our interests as a nation has not helped the united states at all. It's hurt us [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4871.1s)]
*  We spent over 100 billion dollars when we're bankrupt [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4876.38s)]
*  And all we've achieved is destroying this nation that didn't really do to you the poor ukrainians didn't do anything [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4879.92s)]
*  It's horrible. Well what we've done zelensky articulates a very different case, right? [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4885.4400000000005s)]
*  He wanted what's his case his case is he wanted america and europe to help them fight back russia because russia wants to [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4889.68s)]
*  reestablish the ussr [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4896.38s)]
*  And he wants to keep ukraine sovereign. Of course, he has cultural [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4898.240000000001s)]
*  Uh and geographic issues in the eastern part of his country [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4902.96s)]
*  And that has been an ongoing problem for them. I was in ukraine when the russian separatist shot down [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4906.799999999999s)]
*  That malaysian airlines plane lied about it wouldn't let the bodies be reclaimed [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4912.879999999999s)]
*  It was a whole thing putin installed a guy named borowski who was supposedly the prime minister of donetsk [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4917.12s)]
*  Was all bullshit because that's what putin is so [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4922.719999999999s)]
*  They wanted help they want to stay sovereign [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4926.08s)]
*  America was helping with them with them with that and now all of a sudden [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4930.0s)]
*  Zelensky's a thief [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4933.92s)]
*  They're stealing all our money [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4936.08s)]
*  They're selling all our weapons to mexican cartels. None of these things are true. Well, that is that is why no, it is not true [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4938.08s)]
*  It's not just just i'll just but i don't understand what's the point in order give me the point of it [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4944.56s)]
*  And then you can talk to just to define sovereignty sovereignty is the freedom to make independent decisions [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4949.4400000000005s)]
*  And ukraine does not have that and has never had that since 2014 when its government was installed by an american coup [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4956.0s)]
*  Zelensky would say he was democratically elected. Well, he's not democratically elected. He's passed his term [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4962.64s)]
*  Wow, and so by what authority does hold on. Let me question go ahead by what authority [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4968.32s)]
*  Does zelensky negotiate on behalf of this country rule his country? He just he just put his main [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4973.2s)]
*  Political opponent under indictment and froze his personal funds under internal sanctions the security services of ukraine [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4980.3s)]
*  Sounds familiar, doesn't it? [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4988.4s)]
*  I don't know. We just we just went through the same thing in this country sounds like dictatorship [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4990.799999999999s)]
*  By the way, no, but he's not a dictator and that's then by what authority does he rule ukraine? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4994.799999999999s)]
*  So well, here's how he was elected and now under their constitution [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=4999.2s)]
*  He does have the ability to stall elections and operate under martial law during the conflict [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5003.12s)]
*  So you're comfortable with people saying i'm gonna blow no he could certainly have an election if he wanted if he wanted but he [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5009.04s)]
*  Has empowered an election you're from a political family. It's the same thing with israel right now [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not having elections either because they're in the midst of an active conflict. It's not a time for transition of power [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5018.24s)]
*  Okay, but I don't know why [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5023.04s)]
*  We make excuses for dictatorship. It's not a dictatorship. Of course it is any unelected leader [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5025.04s)]
*  Who has the power he was elected. He was actually he has a presidential term, right if joe biden just said [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5030.56s)]
*  You know what? We're in a conflict right now. I can't have elections [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5037.2s)]
*  I'm canceling the election or donald trump, but there's a constitutional provision for this if [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5039.92s)]
*  Okay [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5044.64s)]
*  He could have an election whenever he wanted he could have election right now. No one doubts that actually [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5045.84s)]
*  And his opponent was calling for that before he was just shut down by the ukrainian intel services a week ago [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5050.400000000001s)]
*  so [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5056.24s)]
*  There's no authority. He doesn't have democratic authority over his country. What he has is a lot of nato weapons [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5057.76s)]
*  And to your second point he has absolutely as a matter of fact [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5063.6s)]
*  The ukrainian military has sold those weapons on the black market around the world and they have this these are facts [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5068.88s)]
*  They've wound up in the hands of among others the mexican drug cartels the taliban hamas [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5075.5199999999995s)]
*  Hamas in gaza fact [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5081.84s)]
*  And and a lot of other groups and it's incredibly destabilizing by the way the united states did this [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5084.48s)]
*  years ago in afghanistan as you know and sent out just stinger missiles to the mahajideen in [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5090.32s)]
*  1979 and 80 to fight the soviets and those missiles caused huge problems for all of southwest asia for like 20 years [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5094.7s)]
*  And so this is a big deal and I don't know why people feel like they have to lie about it now [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5100.799999999999s)]
*  I don't I don't know that it's about lying about it. I don't agree that those are facts [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5105.599999999999s)]
*  You don't believe that that the ukrainian military [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5109.84s)]
*  You know what? [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5113.2s)]
*  I'll bet you my car that in the next car is it with some crappy? Oh, then i'm not gonna bet that okay [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5114.5599999999995s)]
*  Um, no, I don't have nice cars. I'll admit that oh, I do bought a new car [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5120.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, but anyway the point is um [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5125.599999999999s)]
*  That's a fact and as I no one believes me I know someone who bought some of the weapons i'm just you know, whatever [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5127.84s)]
*  I can't well first of all you would have to [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5134.96s)]
*  Substantiate, you know who it is that you knew because you believe the most corrupt country in europe [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5137.42s)]
*  Which is so corrupt that nato didn't want it as a member [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5141.52s)]
*  You believe it's outside their own possibility that facing defeat [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5144.320000000001s)]
*  The leaders of that military would not sell the weapons that they're getting from the west [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5148.4800000000005s)]
*  You cannot substantiate a claim on the basis of mere suspicion that because [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5152.16s)]
*  I believe that you think that what i'm saying is I don't think that I know it i'm saying [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5160.96s)]
*  That well, you know that they say it you don't know whether they did and i'll tell you why i'm suspicious [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5165.28s)]
*  because the uh the missiles [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5169.68s)]
*  that russia put out those pictures of [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5173.68s)]
*  were from like 2014 and [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5176.8s)]
*  They didn't even have javelins then [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5179.84s)]
*  So the idea that ukraine could have been selling weapons that were taken from a different time as an obvious [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5182.5599999999995s)]
*  Ploy by russia to make them look bad [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5189.679999999999s)]
*  Is to me propaganda and not proof that they did it [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5192.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, are you texting while i'm having a conversation with you? I'm texting right now very rude [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5196.5599999999995s)]
*  No, no, i'm texting on whatsapp right now [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5201.36s)]
*  On this exact subject tucker i'm not saying you're lying i'm saying i'm disagreeing that it's a fact [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5205.2s)]
*  That the military there is spending weapons that they very much need to mexican cartels [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5211.4400000000005s)]
*  Why does mexico's cartels need to get weapons from ukraine when they get them across our border with straw buyers all the time [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5217.360000000001s)]
*  I mean to me it doesn't even make sense from practicality standpoint, but it seems like you can get surface-tier missiles from straw buyers [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5224.400000000001s)]
*  No, not surface-tier missiles not small arms small arms small arms small arms [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5230.16s)]
*  You know small arms you can buy anywhere. No, no, no i'm talking about weapons systems [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5234.8s)]
*  But this is this is not documented stuff and it seems to want to smear ukraine to make them the bad guy [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5237.68s)]
*  Make russia the good guy Ukraine. Okay. Um, this is one of those topics that i'm i'm just gonna um [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5242.8s)]

*  I know this is true because i'm not saying you're wrong. I'm saying I don't know it's a fact and unfortunately [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5253.200000000001s)]
*  I can't and maybe I shouldn't have brought it up because I can't name the person who told me this [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5259.4400000000005s)]
*  I don't want you to expose a source. What i'm saying is look people [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5263.52s)]
*  Let me let me let me bottom line if I say I have a huge amount of knowledge on this one topic [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5267.68s)]
*  I'm wholly ignorant of many topics. I know a lot about this topic and you think Zelensky is a bad guy [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5273.360000000001s)]
*  Who's a dictator? [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5277.120000000001s)]
*  What i'm telling you is the ukrainian military has sold huge amounts of american supplied nato supplied weapons systems [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5278.4800000000005s)]
*  Around the world and that they're purchased purchasable [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5285.92s)]
*  Now by governments and armed groups and are being purchased and why hasn't it been documented? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5289.54s)]

*  It's to understand this mentality of framing ukraine and zelensky as the bad guy. It's not a mentality. It's not look [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5324.820000000001s)]

*  Constitutionally comfortable if we were well, we are in a war with russia right now [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5337.76s)]
*  If donald trump no, it is war with russia americans have died proxy [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5342.66s)]
*  It's a war that we're funding. We're not on the ground there [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5347.06s)]
*  What do you mean? There are many americans in ukraine fighting us military. There are you yes there are look [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5350.02s)]

*  Did in iraq declare I guess we did that went well. There was a congressional vote [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5372.26s)]
*  Of course [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5377.38s)]
*  Um, but the point is if trump were to say we're at war with russia. I can't have an election. I would say [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5378.26s)]
*  That's not legitimate. You do not have the authority to extend and I don't care [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5384.5s)]
*  You know what pretext you make up for it. You can't put your [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5389.54s)]
*  Opponents in jail. You can't but more than anything what i'm saying is that this is scary [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5393.46s)]
*  It's not even blaming zelensky. There are many power centers within ukraine. There's the military the intel services. There's the president's office [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5398.42s)]
*  There are competing [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5405.46s)]
*  political [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5406.9800000000005s)]
*  People say the same things about us, by the way, of course, it's true. It's true especially true here. It's a huge country [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5408.42s)]
*  I'm not even blaming zelensky directly. I'm saying this is the largest country in europe [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5413.78s)]
*  We have poured billions of dollars [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5419.3s)]
*  In pretty high tech weapons systems into this country and we're not keeping track of them [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5421.9400000000005s)]
*  We also have bio labs throughout the country [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5426.0199999999995s)]
*  We have bio labs and we're about to have more of a footprint because the mineral deal [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5428.74s)]
*  Will put american companies on the ground in those areas that are right now [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5433.06s)]
*  All i'm saying is we've funded the worst war europe has seen since world war two for three years [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5437.86s)]
*  That entails an awful lot of weapons including bio weapons. I'm not guessing this is a fact [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5443.7s)]
*  Tori nuland said it in a conversation with the now [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5448.5s)]
*  Secretary of state marco rubio in the senate on camera [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5451.860000000001s)]
*  So there are bio labs in ukraine with biological weapons in them. Who the hell is keeping track of this stuff? [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5454.900000000001s)]
*  That's all i'm saying. It's not an attack on zelensky. We have a moral obligation to keep track of this stuff [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5460.1s)]
*  There's never been an audit. I have no problem with that. It's fucking crazy. I have no problem with keeping track of destabilization of the world [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5464.66s)]
*  Like why are we doing this? So do you believe that we should just back out of what we're doing there now and let russia take it? [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5471.14s)]
*  Russia take it i don't know at this point russia has russia has we're not in charge russia just won [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5477.3s)]
*  They beat us in their war in case you haven't noticed russia [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5485.22s)]
*  Outproduced in munitions nado including the united states four to one [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5489.4400000000005s)]
*  So we just lost the war so we are not negotiating from position of strength [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5493.860000000001s)]
*  Sorry, i'm not taking russia's side. I'm on america's side. This is terrible for us. We've exposed how weak we are [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5498.5s)]
*  We couldn't beat russia which [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5503.54s)]
*  Many members of the u.s senate assured me was quote a gas station with [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5505.94s)]
*  That was mccain's line [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5510.0199999999995s)]
*  What a fucking idiot that guy was what an idiot he was low [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5511.78s)]
*  I knew him and I liked him, but he was he was like an idiot of gas station with nuclear weapons really [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5515.3s)]
*  Have you see I saw it the other way which is we thought russia [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5520.98s)]
*  We thought russia was going to roll over ukraine and they have been unable to really move the line over us [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5524.18s)]
*  They took a big chunk of eastern ukraine and for three years we've [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5530.0199999999995s)]
*  Progressed toward bankruptcy trying to stop it and we've not been able to they won. This is bad [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5533.06s)]
*  It's bad for american prestige. It's bad for the projection of american power [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5539.780000000001s)]
*  Everyone knows what we're capable of and we're not capable of it's divided our country [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5543.06s)]
*  All these dumb ukraine people are flying foreign flags in front of their houses. I feel that the division [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5547.06s)]
*  Is forced [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5552.34s)]
*  In this country that to me it seems pretty basic that russia can't have ukraine because it doesn't stop [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5554.02s)]
*  What are we gonna do it doesn't stop it we already but okay, but it's some it's estonia and latvia and [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5560.82s)]
*  Estonia, you know, it's always some chick that blonde chick. I'm president of estonia [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5567.5199999999995s)]
*  You know a country of five million people that invented the sauna by the way, i'm part finished. I'm not against estonia [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5573.7s)]
*  i'm sure it's great, but the idea that some [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5579.54s)]
*  woman who's never been the armed service like [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5582.1s)]
*  Setting military policy for the eu, you know, we're gonna do this. We're gonna you can't do anything [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5584.42s)]
*  You don't have an army britain's army is smaller than the u.s marine corps [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5588.74s)]
*  NATO which is a coalition that includes by the way turkey. It's like this huge coalition couldn't beat russia [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5592.74s)]
*  That is the fact I don't want that to be the fact that is the fact but so americans are like well [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5598.5s)]
*  I don't know this well what are you gonna do? [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5603.3s)]
*  I don't say that it's a fact because we are not fighting in earnest in that country [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5605.46s)]
*  So what okay? So what would you i'm just okay here here are the terms [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5609.3s)]
*  We have a nuclear armed power largest nuclear arsenal in the world that is fighting for its very life that is aligned with china [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5612.82s)]
*  Okay, which is the largest economy. Well, I don't know that russia's fighting for its life. I think putin forced this situation [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5618.259999999999s)]
*  Okay, whatever leaving aside moral culpability. I'm just saying it's a big deal for them. It's on their border. It's their border. Okay [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5622.82s)]
*  so [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5629.62s)]
*  We don't like it [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5630.82s)]
*  We weighed in on the other side to fight russia. We haven't won [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5632.5s)]
*  So now what are our options like actually what are our options? [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5636.74s)]
*  The options are what president trump is doing right now [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5642.179999999999s)]
*  Which is to try to get the parties to the table and draw a line in the sand and make a deal [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5645.54s)]
*  Right. That's the only option I see I don't see any other options, but maybe i'd love to hear what they are [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5650.18s)]
*  No, I mean there's never any other option unless you want to actively fight [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5653.3s)]
*  And take territory and occupy who's going to actively fight there. No one is left. Well, look both sides are [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5658.18s)]
*  Manpower poor right? You know the stories about russia emptying the prisons russia has a hundred [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5665.9400000000005s)]
*  Million 140 million people but they 100 million more people, but have you ever heard of us emptying out the prisons? [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5671.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, why does he have to do that? [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5677.139999999999s)]
*  He's in a desperate place because he doesn't want his citizens to have to fight an unpopular war because he's worried about [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5678.34s)]
*  His popularity because he wants to stay in power. So it's easier to send convicts to the front [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5683.62s)]
*  They have done this for centuries. I'm against it, but i'm just saying that's the fact [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5688.18s)]
*  The point is you think putin is concerned about his popularity in a place where he kills all of his opponents on a regular basis [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5692.42s)]
*  Concerned about his popularity really when he completely engineers the outcome of everything that happens [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5698.66s)]
*  Russia is a very complicated place with a lot of different competing power centers, including the fsb [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5703.7s)]
*  Which and how has he stayed in power so long because he's really good at politics and he pays very close attention [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5708.34s)]
*  To what the public thinks very close. He's got the military just like any country. It's a first of all [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5714.099999999999s)]
*  The you know how lousy life is there for people right? [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5720.18s)]
*  And not just because of the economic sanctions right now. It just has been I mean, you know, have you been there recently? [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5723.62s)]
*  Recently, no, i've been there twice. I've been there twice in the last year. Why are you allowed in? [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5728.179999999999s)]
*  I don't know. I'm an american friend of putin. That's whatever new friend of putin because I believe in seeing things and reaching my own [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5734.0199999999995s)]
*  Me too. I'm just i'm not allowed in there as a journalist [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5739.94s)]
*  I'm sure you could call right now and they will let you in and you should go just wouldn't let me out [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5742.179999999999s)]
*  We end up like poe whale and I think you wouldn't be arguing my case [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5745.94s)]
*  But look, here's the point. No, no rush [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5749.78s)]
*  Putin does not have absolute control of his country and they're all kinds of [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5752.42s)]
*  Potential rivals. He's been there for you sound more sympathetic towards him than towards zelensky. I mean [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5756.820000000001s)]
*  You just i'm definitely more sympathetic to putin than zelensky for the following reason [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5762.660000000001s)]
*  I judge i'm not and i'm not sympathetic to putin in the sense that I don't want to move to russia [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5766.820000000001s)]
*  I don't see russia as like a close friend of mine [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5771.22s)]
*  At all or a free country or anything like that. I'm just saying [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5774.5s)]
*  I think it's fair to judge leaders [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5778.34s)]
*  On how they do for their country. They have one job do a good job for your country make it better [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5781.22s)]
*  And you think russia's doing well? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5785.62s)]
*  A lot better than ukraine. I mean a lot of ukrainians have fled ukraine to russia a lot a lot [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5788.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, they're under siege right now. No, but i'm just saying like russia actually for a country at war [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5793.94s)]
*  Is thriving, you know, I think it's got deeper problems war is not good for any economy over time or any country over time [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5801.62s)]
*  But there's been such a massive infusion of chinese investment into russia [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5807.3s)]
*  In the past couple of years that people in say moscow city of 12 million [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5811.54s)]
*  um [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5816.259999999999s)]
*  You know, they don't feel a privation that populations under war typically but there's a reason he made that deal with north korea to have [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5817.139999999999s)]
*  Their people backing them up on the battle lines. I'm sure i'm sure that's exactly right [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5822.259999999999s)]
*  I mean there are a lot of theories on that i've heard a lot of things but here's but here's the only point that i'm making [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5825.7s)]
*  From an american perspective americans fall into this trap, which is a childish trap [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5829.94s)]
*  Where they superimpose like a really clear moral dichotomy onto foreign conflicts where there's like a great guy and an evil guy [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5835.780000000001s)]
*  Yes, and they're able to do that because they don't know anything because they've never been anywhere and they don't actually they're leaders [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5842.58s)]
*  I'm talking about don't kind of take the time to understand that they don't understand [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5847.54s)]
*  The more you know the more you realize you really don't know because do you speak russian? I don't think so [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5852.5s)]
*  So like how the hell do you know what's going on? You don't know [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5856.5s)]
*  The best you can do is like be open-minded and let evidence guide your conclusions. So [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5859.06s)]
*  So [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5863.7s)]
*  From an american perspective [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5864.900000000001s)]
*  What we've learned is the u.s [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5867.38s)]
*  Capacity for projecting strength through the military is a lot less than we thought it was we couldn't beat russia [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5870.58s)]
*  We didn't beat russia. They won [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5875.62s)]
*  Do you really think that america was putting the full force of its might into that situation short of nuclear conflict? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5877.14s)]
*  Yes, zelensky has done nothing but complain about us not giving them what they needed [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5883.54s)]
*  We gave them like high mars everything we're giving them [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5888.5s)]
*  And you know because you've been studying the situation i've been there twice during the conflict [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5891.3s)]
*  And it's like world war one level warfare there. No, it's not like we're using our most now [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5896.5s)]
*  They're using drones from like retail high tech warfare ever [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5901.9400000000005s)]
*  Conducted in fact, it's so high tech. It's moving so fast [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5906.58s)]
*  That I don't think most people even understand what's going on there, but it's a war by drone [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5911.38s)]
*  Now there's been an infusion of drone technology that they're using but they were digging [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5917.22s)]
*  What americans can't you just need to like change your mind a little bit on this [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5921.54s)]
*  We don't have the power to do everything than we want around the world agree. We certainly can't do it simultaneously agreed [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5925.54s)]
*  And my concern about entering into hot wars with anybody is that you expose your weakness [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5932.66s)]
*  If you enter into a hot war something you have to win. Otherwise, everyone knows how weak you are and then [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5939.3s)]
*  But you don't think that's true for russia that they don't look really weak because they couldn't roll over ukraine [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5944.5s)]
*  They said it would be done in three days. The truth is [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5950.02s)]
*  It's a silly conversation russia's nuclear weapons it is hypersonic weapons russia could eliminate ukraine in about 10 seconds [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5954.74s)]
*  It's bombing residential areas. It's going after [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5961.860000000001s)]
*  Infrastructure where they know civilians are so it's not like they're holding out. I mean, let's like let's just be honest [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5965.52s)]
*  And I hope they never will and I hate war and I hate so why haven't they by the way, let's say of course they could [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5971.54s)]
*  Their nuclear nuclear capability hypersonic weapons, but they're not so why the entire city like that because they're not because that's world war three [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5977.46s)]
*  That's why right and they want to get out without a nuclear exchange, right? [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5984.82s)]
*  And what I worry, it's not a defense of russia by the way anybody who's trying to avoid a nuclear exchange [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5988.74s)]
*  I'm on your side. Yes, and that would include almost no republican members of the senate [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5994.5s)]
*  Okay, they're all like full-blown they're old they don't care [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=5999.139999999999s)]
*  Like I said, they don't care about their grandkids or humanity itself or whatever [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6003.139999999999s)]
*  They're totally willing to risk nuclear war or though lindsay graham just took a step backwards, which I thought was surprising [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6006.0199999999995s)]
*  It's completely silly. He's blaming [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6011.46s)]
*  Look a lot's going to come out [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6013.46s)]
*  We reached an impasse on the question of whether ukraine is selling weapons. They are that's a fact and I bet my house on it [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6015.7s)]
*  Okay, I know that to be true, but I can't tell you how I know that so i'm gonna have to just wait to be [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6022.179999999999s)]
*  Vindicated but it's not a debate. I'm just saying that it seems that but let me the line has shifted and now ukraine is the bad guy [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6026.9s)]
*  Okay, we haven't [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6032.66s)]
*  Heard anything about ukraine for the past three years you were required and I got fired over this so I know you were required to pretend [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6034.82s)]
*  That zelensky who I think is a complicated person for whom I feel sorry actually [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6042.58s)]
*  I feel like he's a pawn among bigger powers. Okay, I feel bad for zelensky [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6046.259999999999s)]
*  But we were required to pretend that he was jesus [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6050.5s)]
*  And that vladimir putin was satan and my only point is that's not true actually [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6053.860000000001s)]
*  It's way more complicated than that. Both of them have good and bad qualities [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6058.34s)]
*  And moreover, it's not our it's not our fight [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6062.34s)]
*  Like what are we doing there? This whole thing is so nuts just because you're mad at russia for some reason that you'll never say out loud [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6065.14s)]
*  um [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6071.7s)]
*  We have to take our country to war there. And by the way, can I just say something sure why? [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6072.66s)]
*  I mean this war has [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6078.02s)]
*  Like most wars that we fight [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6080.42s)]
*  Been promoted by some of the richest people in our country and i'll name one ken griffin [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6082.66s)]
*  Who is a hedge fund billionaire has really pushed hard and i've seen it behind the scenes to force republican politicians to [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6087.22s)]
*  support bigger [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6094.82s)]
*  payments to the zelensky government [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6096.18s)]
*  It's like ken griffin's a multi-billionaire [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6098.5s)]
*  He's probably I don't know millions of dollars on lobbying on this issue, but he hasn't spent billions on ukraine [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6101.62s)]
*  He could send billions of his own money to ukraine a lot of the ukraine war supporters could they also go fight the war? [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6106.42s)]
*  They're conscripting 50 year old men guys with down syndrome [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6112.18s)]
*  The videos are all over the internet and they're real [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6116.74s)]
*  I hear from people in ukraine on the sub those videos i've seen yeah, so I haven't noticed any [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6119.22s)]
*  Bill crystal's not fighting in ukraine. Why is that? Why is ken griffin not sending billions to ukraine? No what they're doing is [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6124.9s)]
*  Pressuring the u.s media pressuring the u.s congress to do something that they themselves are not willing to do up to and including sending [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6132.24s)]
*  American troops which we have in ukraine risking their lives [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6138.98s)]
*  Why isn't ken griffin doing that? [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6142.5s)]
*  I just want to say I think it's one of the most immoral things i've ever seen [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6144.179999999999s)]
*  I think that you're heading in the right direction now because I believe [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6147.139999999999s)]
*  That that support the war go pay for it go fight it that complaint [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6151.299999999999s)]
*  That the wealthy and powerful are feeding off the rest of us. I think is the one untapped [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6155.0599999999995s)]
*  Uh reservoir of populist sentiment in this country [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6162.959999999999s)]
*  We have a system I don't think we're allowed to say that well [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6166.9800000000005s)]
*  We have a system where the corporations right get to do whatever they want with the money that they make [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6170.1s)]
*  And they get to work the system to pay as little as possible into the rest of us [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6175.54s)]
*  They still pay more and obviously the taxes are paid more by the wealthy than by those who aren't wealthy [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6179.22s)]
*  But we find ways around it [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6184.58s)]
*  and the government then subsidizes those same corporations even though [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6186.740000000001s)]
*  They don't take care of their own workers and I think that how the powerful are able to leverage our government [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6192.66s)]
*  Is the main fight that we need to have so you'll have like let's say walmart is a great and egregious example [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6198.34s)]
*  They have more of their people on snap as a percentage their workers than any other corporation [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6204.98s)]
*  Yet they're making a lot of money. And then what do we say? Well, they're allowed to give it to their shareholders. That's capitalism [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6210.5s)]
*  Oh, but we tucker carlson and chris guimel have to subsidize your workers [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6215.54s)]
*  I think that that's the main fight now, obviously it's not ukraine [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6221.0599999999995s)]
*  But what i'm saying is rich people imposing their will on the u.s government to do what they want for them [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6223.78s)]
*  Is a real thing. I couldn't agree more. However, I think [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6229.139999999999s)]
*  And I agree with what you said about walmart completely. Why should I subsidize and not just walmart? It's all of them [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6233.54s)]
*  I agree. Well, it's capitalism, but I don't actually think I don't think [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6238.74s)]
*  That that's the greatest threat to our democracy or our freedoms [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6242.9s)]
*  Or our country. I think the because look walmart [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6246.74s)]
*  Huge world's biggest retailer or was [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6250.34s)]
*  a powerful company, obviously [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6253.54s)]
*  It's got a board of directors. It's got shareholders. It's a publicly traded company. You can buy walmart [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6256.0199999999995s)]
*  There's some accountability inherent in that structure [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6263.62s)]
*  If you have someone like ken griffin not to beat up on poor ken griffin who you know [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6266.66s)]
*  I don't think ken griffin's evil. It's just silly but um, but i'll just name him again [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6269.86s)]
*  Ken griffin is like this independent [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6275.06s)]
*  Multi-billionaire who's got massive and there are a lot of these guys with massive political influence because of the money that he has [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6277.68s)]
*  And there's no accountability at all. What you can do to can there's no board of directors of ken griffin. He's a billionaire [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6285.22s)]
*  He is his own power center [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6290.82s)]
*  And he's what we would call if he were russian an oligarch we put sanctions on him [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6293.14s)]
*  That's the new word in the american vernacular and i'm okay with it [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6297.38s)]
*  I think it applies. That's the real threat because like a guy like that. I agree can own [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6300.42s)]
*  His own media outlets. I agree own his own politicians. He can I mean, I don't know why you're not talking about musk in the same way [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6305.38s)]
*  I mean all the tech bros, which I think is a really [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6312.34s)]
*  benign and casual label for these guys [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6316.42s)]
*  um [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6319.54s)]
*  He's doing everything that we're supposed to be worried about happening in this society right now. And again, i'm not [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6320.42s)]
*  Anti-elon musk i'm not I think he's a genius [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6326.96s)]
*  And I just I think that there are things that are happening right now your question and I don't think it's an unfair question at all [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6330.740000000001s)]
*  because I do think [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6338.42s)]
*  The the world that produced elon is this is a world you need to think about a little bit [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6340.1s)]
*  I think there are some definitely some threats [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6345.14s)]
*  elon specifically will always have my [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6347.700000000001s)]
*  love [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6352.34s)]
*  Because he did the most important thing which is restore free speech to the united states through x and he took [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6353.3s)]
*  Because you know free speech doesn't mean anything if you can't actually speak to an audience like I can you know [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6358.42s)]
*  Lecture the mirror in my living room, but it doesn't mean anything [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6363.780000000001s)]
*  I have to be able to talk to other people in order to convince them and there was no place to do that at scale [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6366.34s)]
*  All the social media apps were controlled completely controlled [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6371.860000000001s)]
*  and he has [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6375.860000000001s)]
*  Given a real measure of free speech back to the united states [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6377.3s)]
*  To its citizens, which is really the difference between slavery and freedom is being able to say what you think [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6381.46s)]
*  I mean there's kind of like a free man can say what he believes is true and a slave can't it's that simple [[01:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6386.58s)]
*  so if you want to remain free and not [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6391.299999999999s)]
*  Enslaved then you have to have free speech and no one else seemed to agree with that except this like south african guy [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6393.54s)]
*  The south african ironic rock it is it maybe it's ironic. I don't know. I mean i'm highly opposed to immigration [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6399.219999999999s)]
*  But I have to say including my best friend a lot of the best people I know are immigrants [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6405.54s)]
*  And they appreciate america for for what actually makes it great, which is its core freedoms [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6410.0199999999995s)]
*  And what do you mean? You're against immigration? We have too much migration and we've made the country [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6414.9s)]
*  No, it's the difference between too much and none. Well, not against immigration. You just said in theory [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6419.0599999999995s)]
*  Okay, we need to shut down all immigration right now until we can [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6424.26s)]
*  Retain a regain equilibrium and like figure out what it is that holds us all together as a nation. It's too chaotic [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6428.74s)]
*  It's too crazy right now. No more people period none cap it right now and then just cooling off period [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6434.099999999999s)]
*  30 or 40 years cooling off from what this is all stuff that trump has [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6440.099999999999s)]
*  Has stoked as the biggest problem we have it is the biggest problem we have and i'll tell you exactly why because [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6444.34s)]
*  It creates chaos and disunity [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6450.42s)]
*  If you have a continental-sized country like we do the main question you have always every day you're thinking about all day long [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6453.06s)]
*  How do we hold together? How do 50 states not become 50 countries? [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6459.46s)]
*  I mean that will naturally happen right because each governor sees himself as a caesar [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6463.540000000001s)]
*  So how do you keep them cohesive? [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6468.1s)]
*  And the only way to do that is short of force you could just like get nukes and tell everyone to obey but short of that [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6470.74s)]
*  Short of becoming a totalitarian country. It's by consent. It's because everybody thinks we're in this together. We're all americans [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6477.3s)]
*  We have this in common [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6483.86s)]
*  And it used to be race and religion it no longer is [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6485.78s)]
*  Okay. So what is it? [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6489.38s)]
*  Crickets, what is it? What is it that we all have in common? [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6492.1s)]
*  And no one is even trying to answer that question and until you can answer that question [[01:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6496.42s)]
*  You are going to move toward disunity. The drug cartels will take over, you know, texas, arizona, new mexico [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6500.9s)]
*  And there'll be their own thing and you know wingland will be its own thing and you know, god knows what will happen [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6505.78s)]
*  But it'll break apart [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6509.7s)]
*  Because that's just the nature of people of human society [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6511.78s)]
*  So we need a period where we can think through what it is to be an american what unites us [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6514.0199999999995s)]
*  What's our civic religion? It can't just be everyone's gay. That's not enough [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6520.1s)]
*  Pride flag is not enough to hold a country together [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6525.06s)]
*  What is it and immigration makes it impossible because it's too much churn things change too fast. Like who are these people? [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6527.7s)]
*  It's how we've populated the country [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6533.22s)]
*  Not at this scale. We've never had immigration like this as a portion of population [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6535.62s)]
*  We've never had it. This is and by the way, it's happening at exactly the time when [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6539.14s)]
*  Technology is certain to like overturn our economy and employment structure. Like ai is going to change everything [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6543.52s)]
*  It's too much change at once people's brains can't handle this much change and whoever [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6548.74s)]
*  opened [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6554.18s)]
*  The spigot and flooded our country with 15 or 25 million illegals [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6555.86s)]
*  In the past four years should be in prison for the rest of his life [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6560.66s)]
*  That's the worst thing that's ever been done to this country [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6563.46s)]
*  And I don't know if we can recover from it and I think it'll become [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6565.54s)]
*  obvious as soon as there's an economic downturn that [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6569.54s)]
*  like [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6573.14s)]
*  The fundamentals have not been tended to at all [[01:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6574.26s)]
*  But when i'm really worried about it, I look I understand that you're worried about it and I understand why you would be right [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6577.22s)]
*  But I just wanted to say it's being preached to you for years. No, it's not preached to me. I notice it [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6582.66s)]
*  I notice it well, but i'm saying look this is how many americans want their kids to serve in the military now? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6586.82s)]
*  Very few right so that's a huge that's been true for a long time by the way [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6591.54s)]
*  Not a long time longer than the last four years. Oh for sure. Oh, it precedes biden for sure [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6594.66s)]
*  but not the last 20 not the last 20 I don't think you can look at immigration as [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6599.54s)]
*  An unprecedented bad in america. It is america. Otherwise, you don't have one not at this scale [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6604.9800000000005s)]
*  Not at the scales too many people but even if you wanted to even if you wanted to look at the people [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6610.34s)]
*  Even if you want to say there are 15 million people who aren't supposed to be here. They all came in illegally. Okay [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6614.5s)]
*  One you see how easier it is to say that than to do something about it, right? [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6619.700000000001s)]
*  Because he was going to come in and round them all up and now it's an unsolvable problem [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6623.780000000001s)]
*  Well, it's the question is is it a problem or is it a challenge and it is a mixed bag? [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6627.620000000001s)]
*  You have seven million open jobs in the country that are necessary. What does that tell you? [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6633.3s)]
*  You don't have enough people to fill them. Okay [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6637.46s)]
*  So that means that the 15 million people haven't taken everybody's jobs and why are they government benefits saturated the market? [[01:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6640.34s)]
*  Um, why are we giving government benefits to people here legally? It's a legitimate political question now when you know [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6646.900000000001s)]
*  No, it's not a political question. It's like a it's a social question. It's like a core question [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6652.900000000001s)]
*  It's like if you want them to fill these jobs, why are you subsidizing them not to work? [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6656.1s)]
*  Well, it's not that they're subsidizing not to to work. Why are you subsidizing them at all? [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6659.620000000001s)]
*  Because that was a politic that's why i'm saying it's a political decision [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6663.860000000001s)]
*  They decided to do that you could decide not to do that now they don't get social security benefits very often you'll hear [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6666.5s)]
*  They're young people, but you have a third of and again, these are all rough estimates because your point about tracking [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6672.18s)]
*  We don't do this. Well here either [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6677.54s)]
*  You have a third [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6679.62s)]
*  Let's say maybe close to a half of illegal entrants working in this country whose employers pay into social security for them [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6681.06s)]
*  No, I know all these they do not get any of the benefits of that. So we should be grateful to the no [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6688.82s)]
*  No, no, no, not grateful, but you got to see it as a mixed bag. It's not your little demon seed running around [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6693.22s)]
*  I see it as the greatest failure [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6699.860000000001s)]
*  This country's ever presided over which is the failure to encourage its own citizens to buy into the country sufficient to have kids [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6701.860000000001s)]
*  You have to have an economy that allows young people who aren't rich whose parents aren't rich to get married and have kids [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6708.02s)]
*  And we haven't done that and the middle class is now the minority of the of the country [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6713.9400000000005s)]
*  It's super hard for people to get married and have kids and so rather than fix that problem because it would I don't know [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6716.9800000000005s)]
*  Make larry fink less rich you have to import people because oh we need workers [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6723.38s)]
*  Well, what about I mean we both grew up in a world where people had kids and they don't know [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6727.7s)]
*  And whose fault is that? It's our leader's fault. That's like a core fault. That's like a true sin [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6731.780000000001s)]
*  It's always been both right? I'm second generation in this country [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6736.18s)]
*  So you've always been doing both you've been having babies and you've been bringing in people because that's the american [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6739.3s)]
*  That's the american opportunity. No, but what you haven't had is the birth rate just like ending for native-born americans ending [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6743.62s)]
*  And then and then you have the thing I referred to earlier which is the chaos of of change [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6750.5s)]
*  Change produces chaos now. Hopefully there's again an equilibrium that is achieved over time [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6756.5s)]
*  But you don't think trump made a boogeyman of a legal entrance in this country by saying [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6761.06s)]
*  They're the bad hombres [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6766.26s)]
*  They're all bringing the murders and you know that the crime rate among that population isn't the same as the native population [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6767.46s)]
*  A single crime by the illegal aliens unacceptable illegal immigration is unacceptable [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6773.3s)]
*  The one is too many is a very convenient standard though, it's not we don't use that anywhere else you're not from here [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6777.46s)]
*  You're not american. What are you doing here? [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6782.0199999999995s)]
*  You broke laws of my country to get here [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6783.46s)]
*  Yes [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6785.38s)]
*  And you expect me to like it and me to kiss your ass and me to give you [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6785.7s)]
*  Housing vouchers and food stamps and free education for your kids. What I didn't sign up for that. I was born here [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6788.74s)]
*  I'm not I actually like immigrants. That's just trying to say [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6794.42s)]
*  Elon musk my best friend and business partner like a million immigrants. I love [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6797.22s)]
*  but [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6802.18s)]
*  Inviting people in illegally immediately putting them on welfare when they have no relevant skills to a tech economy, which they don't [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6803.14s)]
*  A lot of them can't read we don't know the real names [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6810.660000000001s)]
*  How is that good for america in no sense is it it's the destruction of america and everyone knows that and everyone's so [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6814.18s)]
*  Paralyzed by race guilt. They can't say it but it's not about race [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6819.62s)]
*  It's about a basic question that any country has to ask itself, which is what do I have in common with my neighbors? [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6823.3s)]
*  Why are we all in this together? I got nothing in common with my neighbors now [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6829.62s)]
*  We don't speak the same language. So how is this a country like these are not [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6832.74s)]
*  Questions that racists ask these are questions that any normal logical person would ask like what is this? [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6837.38s)]
*  But that's why no one wants to fight for the country [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6843.38s)]
*  Because they're attacking people who are born here our wars are fought by white men from the south and the midwest [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6846.0199999999995s)]
*  I mean actually fought and that's provable [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6852.58s)]
*  That's just a fact you have a line of minorities in the military also [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6856.0199999999995s)]
*  You could argue it's one of their last avenues to equality [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6859.46s)]
*  But the every war that this country has fought so far has been [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6862.9s)]
*  Disproportionately fought by those two groups and those are exactly the groups that are leadership class hates hates and it's constantly [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6866.719999999999s)]
*  Diversity is designed to hurt those to hurt those people but most of the leadership class are those people [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6872.5s)]
*  You're absolutely right about that. You're absolutely right about that. The war on whites is being waged by whites. It's 100 true [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6878.42s)]
*  What is that about? I'm not sigman-freud. I don't know. I'm just telling you that if [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6884.9s)]
*  You know our entire media establishment and and not just our like the vibe the law [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6889.9400000000005s)]
*  Diversity is designed to discriminate against those people. So why do they fight your wars? That's just true and then normal people [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6895.84s)]
*  I put myself in this class for like I don't even know what it is that we're fighting for [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6903.3s)]
*  More trans people or whatever like what is this project about? These are all answerable questions, by the way all is not lost [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6908.58s)]
*  I'm just saying [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6915.78s)]
*  You need to just pause and think through the basics [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6917.22s)]
*  I think the country is the best country in the world totally salvageable [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6920.82s)]
*  We can turn this around. I'm not talking about the economy. I mean the social fabric, which is much more important than the economy [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6924.900000000001s)]
*  But we need to do it now and take it seriously and not just like listen to aei and measure everything in gdp [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6932.02s)]
*  Those people are stupid. So you don't understand what it is to be american anymore. Will you tell me? [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6937.9400000000005s)]
*  I think we've got 350 million people here what unites them [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6943.86s)]
*  The opportunity what opportunity economic opportunity opportunity to live a life of your own making to succeed or fail on your own merits [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6947.219999999999s)]
*  Okay, so the meritocracy to be judged by what you do not what you look like. That's right. Okay, so [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6955.379999999999s)]
*  every [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6961.54s)]
*  Institution in american life almost without any exception at all has abandoned that standard [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6962.719999999999s)]
*  And now has something called dei or diversity hiring not anymore. You just had an administration strip it all out [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6967.0599999999995s)]
*  They all do still in place. I mean they're fighting it [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6972.58s)]
*  but where were you when [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6975.9400000000005s)]
*  Every institution decided to hire on the basis of sex and race, which is the opposite of the standard you're describing [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6978.66s)]
*  Why did they do that? [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6985.54s)]
*  That's a really interesting question. I mean from my perspective [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6988.42s)]
*  Yes, it's an attempt to destroy the west [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6992.58s)]
*  And because that I mean, what is the wet you said it yourself? [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6995.38s)]
*  What is america you said it's a place where you can rise or fall on your own merits and that's the one thing [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=6998.0199999999995s)]
*  That's been destroyed. So I actually agree with you, but we don't have that anymore and it was destroyed [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7003.94s)]
*  Was it destroyed when women were given the vote? [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7008.5s)]
*  Or when minorities were given the vote? Of course not. Okay, because there had been a system that was limiting [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7012.259999999999s)]
*  But women were given the vote in 1919 and minorities were given [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7017.94s)]
*  Minorities had the vote in a lot of places some they didn't but the civil rights act was 1965 [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7023.219999999999s)]
*  Um, so it's been 60 years. So the point is look I get that I get what the frustration with dei was [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7028.34s)]
*  I understand no, no, it's not the frustration. It's that it gets to the fundamental question of what is it? [[01:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7034.18s)]
*  I asked you what's an american you said you don't want us to be american [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7038.82s)]
*  I said I really don't I want to and I think we need to figure that out and you said I know what it is [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7041.22s)]
*  It's anyone who comes here can rise or fall on his own merits and I said where were you when that was destroyed [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7045.78s)]
*  It's totally destroyed. I don't we need to rebuild it. It's not about white men being bad white rage [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7052.0199999999995s)]
*  Thank you mark milley, it's about the principle [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7058.58s)]
*  That undergirds the whole country is it's what it is to be american and they took it away [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7062.34s)]
*  And no one said anything about it and anyone who did was called a racist. No, it's no listen I [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7066.82s)]
*  I get the cancel culture concerns and it's not cancel culture. It's like fundamental dude what since we don't have no i'm saying being called [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7070.9s)]
*  Racist for saying what you just said is a function of cancel culture. It's unfair about that. But what i'm saying is this [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7078.08s)]
*  You didn't have [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7084.18s)]
*  minorities [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7086.0s)]
*  Being given the opportunities because they were minorities that was something that america wanted to correct because it is the opposite [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7087.14s)]
*  of equality [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7094.740000000001s)]
*  Okay, and it was the same with women and that's what you should be trying to do [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7096.34s)]
*  No, not to the exclusion of anyone else not to the exclusion of merit [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7101.780000000001s)]
*  But you don't want people held back because of what they are either people as you said, i'm just quoting you [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7105.46s)]
*  My oracle [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7112.099999999999s)]
*  Thank you that what it is to be an american is to participate in a system that judges judges you in the basis of what you do [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7113.22s)]
*  Yes, who you are where you came from what your parents did or what they look like land of opportunity land of opportunity [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7118.66s)]
*  And I press what does that mean and you you said what I just said [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7123.38s)]
*  And so every institution in american life to this day [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7126.5s)]
*  The meaningful ones the universities the large corporations the federal government [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7130.5s)]
*  to this day [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7136.099999999999s)]
*  Has abandoned that and moved aggressively in the other direction there are federal set asides [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7137.86s)]
*  the ladders of success the merit badges that we require [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7142.82s)]
*  To enter these institutions mostly in education [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7147.0599999999995s)]
*  totally determined by race and sex [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7150.42s)]
*  And that's the opposite of what you said. So then and that's been going on for 60 years. So [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7153.38s)]
*  Okay, so clearly it's not the land of opportunity what is it [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7159.62s)]
*  No, I believe it's a giant pinata party where the most aggressive person gets the biggest pile [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7162.5s)]
*  So larry fink is the richest guy because he elbowed people in the face the hardest [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7167.219999999999s)]
*  I mean that's kind of what it is. There is a little bit of who and how the system gets worked [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7170.419999999999s)]
*  but [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7176.339999999999s)]
*  I would disagree that it has been destroyed. I would disagree that [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7177.299999999999s)]
*  Because you still have whites in dominant positions everywhere that you can measure. It's not about whites. It's about people [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7182.179999999999s)]
*  It's about human beings [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7188.5s)]
*  Are you going to judge the person on the content of his character the color of his skin? [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7189.54s)]
*  But you weren't judging them on the content of their character and when you know, it's hard to know that if you if you look at [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7192.58s)]
*  corporate studies of [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7198.1s)]
*  What diversity does to them it increases productivity increases you're talking about the mckinsey study from 2018 which has been it's a joke [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7200.18s)]
*  It's a joke. It's been utterly debunked and they were selling their diversity consultants. I'm i'm not referring to that study [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7207.22s)]
*  But I remember what you're talking about shows hiring people on the basis of skin color makes a company more effective [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7212.9s)]
*  of skin colors that you [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7217.86s)]
*  Remove the restriction there are no restrictions that you won't hire them as often because of their skin color [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7219.54s)]
*  Okay, I have a simple solution for this is called standardized testing [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7226.18s)]
*  And it was created in order to solve the problem that you describe which is bias [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7229.7s)]
*  And so standardized testing was a good faith effort by the wasps by the way [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7234.82s)]
*  Who ran the big american universities to be fair? They're trying to be fair [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7240.42s)]
*  It's like, okay, let's just pick people on the basis of their intelligence their aptitudes and aptitude test, right? [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7244.74s)]
*  and [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7250.5s)]
*  That kind of worked actually it it elevated not just wasps, but you know jews and catholics and black people and everybody [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7251.38s)]
*  Was judged on the basis and it was imperfect, of course [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7259.0599999999995s)]
*  But basically it worked and it's why america dominated the world because it had the smartest people in positions of power [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7262.0199999999995s)]
*  And then at the apogee at the top [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7268.26s)]
*  We abandoned it and we're like, oh this isn't working. What do you mean? It's not working. It's totally working [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7271.06s)]
*  It's working because then we get the cream of all the other countries the smartest people from the world move here including some of my friends [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7275.14s)]
*  the best [[02:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7281.22s)]
*  And then we abandoned it and we're like, well, that's unfair. How is it unfair? [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7282.74s)]
*  It's the definition of fairness. You're judging someone without even knowing what he looks like or his sex on the basis of his performance [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7285.54s)]
*  How is that unfair? [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7292.1s)]
*  They never explained they just took it away and now it's gone and now in federal contracting if you're a woman-owned business [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7293.62s)]
*  Why do I have an interest in a woman-owned business? I don't care who owns the business [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7300.26s)]
*  You're ignoring the impact of the trump administration which has been what's been six weeks [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7303.38s)]
*  I know but i'm saying you strip it out. You'll see what happens. I don't think diversity is our problem [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7308.02s)]
*  And standardized testing. I don't have a problem with it diversity was a problem. I'm not saying you did i'm stating it as a proposition [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7313.54s)]
*  what i'm saying is that the [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7318.900000000001s)]
*  the testing [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7321.62s)]
*  Assumes equal starting points if you and I are both going to take a standardized test right now [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7323.62s)]
*  In an area that I am prepared for and you're not [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7328.9s)]
*  Then we're not going to do the same. Well, go ahead and prepare for it then. I mean, I don't know what to say [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7332.34s)]
*  What's a better way to do it the point? Well, i'm not saying there's a better way [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7335.94s)]
*  I'm saying that I don't have a problem with standardized testing. I don't have a problem with sat's [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7339.22s)]
*  And people having to use them to get into educational institutions. I don't have any problem with it [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7344.82s)]
*  I'm saying that you also have to be open to the reality [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7348.98s)]
*  That the kids aren't going to do the same on the test when one has had a good education and one has not had a good [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7352.58s)]
*  Education, you know, there's a lot of science behind that and and the truth is darker and harder to deal with okay [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7357.86s)]
*  Which is that intelligence is the product of environment to some extent, but it's mostly genetic [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7362.74s)]
*  And intelligence is a lot of factors in success [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7368.42s)]
*  But intelligence is the single most important over time in big populations smarter populations do better [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7371.7s)]
*  They make more money. They go to jail less often. They stay married [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7376.82s)]
*  Singapore is a more successful society [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7380.66s)]
*  Than the united states for this reason. Okay, so that's the truth if you have a meritocratic society [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7383.219999999999s)]
*  the smartest people will have most of the money and most of the success and [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7388.74s)]
*  That doesn't seem fair to people is the truth actually and as we got better at sorting the smart people and [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7395.0599999999995s)]
*  Sending them to harvard and mckinsey and you know onto private equity it became more obvious [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7402.5s)]
*  No, it's true though. It became obvious that the meritocracy was producing an incredibly lopsided society [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7407.54s)]
*  And that freaked people out and it felt unfair to them and two people in the early 1990s wrote a book on it [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7413.78s)]
*  Dick hernstein and and murray [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7420.259999999999s)]
*  Um, and it was called the bell curve and it had a chapter on race in it, which was you know made a lot of people mad [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7423.219999999999s)]
*  They could have taken that chapter out and it would have been I think the transformative book [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7429.700000000001s)]
*  Ever because it described what I just said, which is the meritocracy [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7434.1s)]
*  Produces an outcome that you may not be ready for [[02:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7438.4800000000005s)]
*  Actually because it's rooted in nature and you can't change it and head start which was designed to increase the iq of poor kids [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7441.860000000001s)]
*  Didn't work and no one even wants to talk about it anymore [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7448.660000000001s)]
*  It's really hard to change people's intelligence and intelligence turns out to be the main predictor of economic success [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7451.38s)]
*  So these are super complicated questions [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7457.9400000000005s)]
*  but I know [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7461.06s)]
*  That a system that rewards people on the basis of race and punishes others on the basis of race creates hatred and division [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7462.34s)]
*  I don't think the point is I don't think you have to do it that way is what i'm saying and I understand [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7468.26s)]
*  I can't get into college [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7473.06s)]
*  If if two people apply to college and they're different colors and the one with the lower sat score is admitted because of his race [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7474.66s)]
*  that's penalizing [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7481.54s)]
*  I understand which is why it's no longer the law of the country [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7483.7s)]
*  It's true in every college in the united states as you know, especially the selective ones including the one you went to but they change [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7485.86s)]
*  The law they they lie and the harvard case showed that you can say they did this with the u.c system in california [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7490.66s)]
*  Which was once a great system when I grew up in that state and it's now a joke [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7496.98s)]
*  um because of this [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7500.58s)]
*  But they basically found out that they were just like we have too many asians can't have too many asians. That's exactly right [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7502.5s)]
*  Yeah, what was interesting to me about the case is that it wasn't white people [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7507.54s)]
*  It was asian people who were saying that they were being discriminated against basically the way they shut down the conversation [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7510.66s)]
*  Is by making everyone feel guilty about slavery which no living person anything to do with at all and no living person [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7515.46s)]
*  I've ever met supports. I couldn't be more opposed to it. Um, that's why i'm for free speech because i'm against slavery [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7519.780000000001s)]
*  But but it's also it's not a coincidence that people of color specifically african-american [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7524.58s)]
*  Are at a different socioeconomic level given how they were introduced to the country, right? [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7531.780000000001s)]
*  Because race is completely fabricated there is no such thing as race. We made it up [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7536.98s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. What do you mean? You cut open a black guy and a white guy [[02:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7541.62s)]
*  Their genetics are the same. That's okay. We made race. I don't know what you're coming. We made race [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7545.54s)]
*  We made it we made it a thing just because you look different doesn't mean you're different species [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7550.58s)]
*  So we created hold on. No one's saying anyone's a different species. I'm not saying that you are i'm saying [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7554.66s)]
*  I think we may be getting into science still too deep. Yeah, I didn't know i'm saying the science is very simple [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7559.46s)]
*  She created race and wait, wait, hold on wait, I don't know what you're talking about [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7564.099999999999s)]
*  So you're saying that there's no there are no differences between the races. So you for example [[02:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7567.46s)]
*  The genetic predisposition to certain diseases is fake [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7572.82s)]
*  There are cultural there are ethnic cultural there are ethnic pockets, right? So italians [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7576.26s)]
*  Have certain things that are more common because of that group of animals breeding with each other than you'll have with irish people [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7582.66s)]
*  Or with polish people sure sure and then as they all mix it [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7589.14s)]
*  Do you acknowledge genetics is real? Of course genetics is real. Okay, so genetics is everything what i'm saying is that race [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7592.26s)]
*  What i'm saying that race is everything but genetics is everything race is race is a social construct [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7599.62s)]
*  Okay. Well race is a social construct in some ways. Yeah, but there's no doubt that there are [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7605.38s)]
*  Significant. No, I don't I mean look irish and italians are different cultures, right? [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7612.08s)]
*  But they're the same people they're just different cultures speak different ways eat different things [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7616.34s)]
*  Same people they don't look the same and they're not genetically the same. That's not true. They are genetically the same [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7621.62s)]
*  Well, that's untrue. It's factually untrue [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7626.5s)]
*  Um, and you can see it in all kinds of ways. What's what's the percentage of redheads in sicily pretty high? [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7629.3s)]
*  I doubt it. Okay. So um what you're saying doesn't make any sense at all [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7635.0599999999995s)]
*  That doesn't mean it's genetics. It's just where people decide to be no hair color is determined by genetics [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7639.14s)]
*  It's not a cultural concept. I know but i'm saying that having neither is height or eye color or iq [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7644.0199999999995s)]
*  Having more redheads in italy is not just about genetics. It's about where people populate, right? [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7648.18s)]
*  Like you could you could take a huge like look at look at sissily, right? [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7655.3s)]
*  Look at the history of sissily when north africa winds up being there, right and in power [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7658.9800000000005s)]
*  You wind up having that mixed into the chemistry of everybody who's sicilian because genetics are real. That's exactly race [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7664.58s)]
*  as a thing [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7672.34s)]
*  We created okay. I'm not [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7673.860000000001s)]
*  Exactly sure. I understand the distinctions that you're drawing. I'm just saying that different [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7676.799999999999s)]
*  People different groups of people and different individuals have different genetic makeups [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7681.54s)]
*  And they're not wildly different. We're all members of the same species. We are all created by god as a christian. I believe that [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7686.339999999999s)]
*  But we didn't have these problems when people were christian because the underlying assumption was that god created everyone everyone has a soul [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7691.78s)]
*  it's only when this became [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7698.74s)]
*  A secular society that hates god that you could treat people like animals and objects [[02:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7700.58s)]
*  Well slavery was during a time where it was a pretty heavy is nothing compared to ai and transhumanism [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7704.74s)]
*  nothing, nothing so [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7710.58s)]
*  Because slavery, you know evil though it is it still exists by the way around the world, but um, it's evil [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7712.58s)]
*  And christians got rid of it. No one no other group did christians got rid of that [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7719.7s)]
*  Because they thought it was evil because they thought god created each person [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7723.3s)]
*  But even under most certainly in the west certainly united states even under slavery here evil as it was [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7726.1s)]
*  slaves were still considered [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7732.66s)]
*  human they didn't possess the same rights [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7734.66s)]
*  but [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7737.3s)]
*  ai and transhumanism [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7738.66s)]
*  Transhuman specifically seeks to redefine what a human being is when you merge people with machines [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7741.28s)]
*  Then you don't acknowledge the existence of a soul [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7746.66s)]
*  How good if you believe that each person has a distinct soul that god [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7749.219999999999s)]
*  Cares about each person like a speck of sand on the beach [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7752.9s)]
*  Each person is accounted for and watched over by god and cared for by god and has a has a destiny [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7755.54s)]
*  How could you [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7761.299999999999s)]
*  Merge that person with a computer [[02:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7762.9s)]
*  Because once you do that, then you don't have to acknowledge the soul then you can treat that person like the object that you've made him into [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7765.139999999999s)]
*  And um, of course, we don't even discuss this but ever the point is look my only point is [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7771.86s)]
*  Is [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7776.66s)]
*  This is a super complicated topic as I think we're proving and [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7777.860000000001s)]
*  There are always unintended consequences of any system that you set up, but I know [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7781.7s)]
*  From just watching the world and watching the united states that the second you make race a key [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7787.14s)]
*  For appearance, whatever you want to call it [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7792.74s)]
*  um [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7795.06s)]
*  genetics a key component in awarding [[02:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7796.34s)]
*  or punishing [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7800.34s)]
*  Then you make everybody hate each other and you wind up like rwanda [[02:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7802.1s)]
*  You don't want to create differences. You want to create similarities. Well, there are differences, but you want to find commonalities [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7805.14s)]
*  Yes, and I think that look that's what that's what the land of opportunity is all about treat people as individuals [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7809.780000000001s)]
*  Why do I give a shit if someone's a woman or black? I care about that person him or her [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7815.06s)]
*  Are you a good person? Do you do a good job? I care about you [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7820.5s)]
*  Yes, I don't care about all your ancestor people look like you this whole freight this the this term don't use community [[02:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7823.46s)]
*  It's totally fake there's no black community or white community or gay community. They're only people [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7829.3s)]
*  No woman ever gave birth to a community. That's not a thing. That doesn't care. But he cares about people [[02:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7835.3s)]
*  It's a social construct. No, but it's a way for politicians to dehumanize people actually [[02:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7840.1s)]
*  I hate it or fragment people but to treat them as less than human. You're not a you're not chris cuomo [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7845.38s)]
*  You're part of the italian community [[02:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7850.1s)]
*  You're part of the buff 50 year old community. You're part of the former talk show host community or whatever [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7851.860000000001s)]
*  Like that makes you less than who you are. No, your name is chris cuomo. You have a soul [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7856.9800000000005s)]
*  God knew you before you were born. You have a destiny after you die like [[02:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7862.18s)]
*  Look, I'm in a community. Fuck you. I get I get I get all the metaphysical aspects of it what i'm saying [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7865.860000000001s)]
*  but what i'm saying is [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7871.860000000001s)]
*  when you discover that [[02:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7873.78s)]
*  Women aren't given the opportunities because they're women or blacks aren't given opportunities because they're black in america [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7875.46s)]
*  That's something that we see as corrective [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7882.18s)]
*  That you you want to address that has made the problem worse. We saw leeches is corrective too [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7884.580000000001s)]
*  We saw radium theory is corrective too [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7889.620000000001s)]
*  Like just because you claim it's medicine doesn't mean it's not poison and this has been poisoned and this has poisoned our country [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7892.18s)]
*  It's made everyone way more race conscious that we're roughly the same age [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7898.26s)]
*  People are not half as race conscious when we were kids as they are now [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7901.540000000001s)]
*  They weren't half as angry about race as they are now [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7904.5s)]
*  And that's a byproduct of the system that was supposed to make things better. It made it much worse [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7907.620000000001s)]
*  And our politics. I mean look the trump administration, which I think is a very interesting aspect about our conversation [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7911.14s)]
*  think about it [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7918.42s)]
*  you and I have sat together, I don't know how long if it goes past like that, but [[02:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7919.9400000000005s)]
*  We haven't even talked about anything in the news. Really. I mean we're talking I had deeper questions for you [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7924.5s)]
*  And I love it, but i'm saying that's the beauty that's the beauty right? [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7930.1s)]
*  That's the beauty of the forum of the freedom of what we're able to do here [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7933.38s)]
*  Which you would never be able to do just by time let her let alone by subject inclination [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7937.62s)]
*  We are very divided and we are divided in ways [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7942.9s)]
*  that I [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7946.82s)]
*  Haven't experienced before I agree and I think that a big part of it is that it works [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7948.5s)]
*  It's working for people who want power and to keep power [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7955.3s)]
*  division sells these days [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7959.12s)]
*  It is and maybe it always has and that's why we know what a demagogue is [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7961.78s)]
*  But there's no positive opposite term that the greeks gave us. It's easy to play on people's outrage [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7965.3s)]
*  But when I see the trump administration he came in [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7970.9800000000005s)]
*  fomenting division [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7975.52s)]
*  And I thought it was a very tricky sell for him because if he if what I hear about him is true [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7977.7s)]
*  Which is he wanted to win again because of legacy mode and be remembered is great [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7982.74s)]
*  You can't be great as a divider. There's no american figure in our history who was great because they were a divider [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7987.62s)]
*  Every american leader has been a divider every leader is a divider by definition us versus them the enemy versus the homeland [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=7994.58s)]
*  You know the first presidents of the united states drove the loyalists to nova scotia. Some of them were my relatives [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8002.820000000001s)]
*  So I know that um, so you will divide the question is on what basis and [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8006.9800000000005s)]
*  The thing that I worry most about in a country this diverse is racial division because it doesn't go away and those wounds just remain forever [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8012.820000000001s)]
*  Or certainly for generations we've seen that with slavery, which I do think has left scars [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8020.26s)]
*  I would not deny that it's clearly real [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8024.26s)]
*  so anybody who foments racial division is is committing a graver sin than average and [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8026.82s)]
*  To see trump get the support of a multi-racial coalition, which he did [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8032.98s)]
*  Is the most hopeful thing ever and so if in the end it becomes trump against? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8037.62s)]
*  the [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8043.3s)]
*  People who've wrecked our country in the permanent bureaucracies. I'm [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8044.1s)]
*  You know, I think that's pretty good outcome when you see what he's doing right now [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8048.5s)]
*  you don't see him as is [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8052.179999999999s)]

*  There's no question and I think you make a fair point and in general [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8058.9s)]
*  I [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8062.74s)]
*  Am on the side of builders over destroyers because I think it's much easier that you know, I hate vandalism [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8063.7s)]
*  And uh just on a gut level. I hate it. I believe in building and improving [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8069.54s)]
*  But I do think in this case and I think it's tough and I think it's a tough balance [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8074.1s)]
*  You know, you can get into a frenzy of destruction. We just break things because they're there [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8078.9800000000005s)]
*  Like I can't think of anything that the administration is telling us is good and works in our society [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8083.54s)]
*  Well, let me put it this way. I've watched vandalism in the last [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8088.9800000000005s)]
*  Really since memorial day 2020 when the george floyd [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8094.42s)]
*  Riots began i've watched vandalism on a scale [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8098.1s)]
*  I never thought I would ever see in this country not just physical vandalism but vandalism of [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8100.42s)]
*  Our cherished institutions whether it's the episcopal church that I grew up in the st. George school high school [[02:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8105.22s)]

*  And she was capped on the tennis team. I played tennis mostly smoked cigarettes, but hacked around on the court [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8141.46s)]
*  And um in the 80s and like we're trying to raise this tennis money for tennis [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8146.74s)]

*  You have to call these people [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8160.1s)]
*  I love the school. I met my husband. They were married there and my dad was headmaster. You know, we love the school [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8161.62s)]

*  Um, he's such a nice guy super uncomfortable. He knew that if he went back to the school and said we paid for the whole tennis center [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8189.9400000000005s)]
*  with one donation [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8197.460000000001s)]
*  Uh, yeah, no, they turned it down not that we were gonna give 11 million dollars for a tent or I don't have 11 million dollars [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8199.62s)]
*  but if I did I I wouldn't give it to a tennis center in a boarding school, but [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8204.1s)]
*  Um, isn't that funny? So that's how they feel about me [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8207.54s)]
*  and [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8210.66s)]
*  You are able to laugh at it because [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8212.66s)]
*  Because i'm happy i've had a really happy life and we have a really close family and you also don't respect the basis of their rejection [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8215.22s)]
*  Of course not and I know I know what my that's the key [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8221.460000000001s)]
*  I know what my sins are and i've committed a lot of them and I who hasn't i'm ashamed of myself in a lot of ways [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8223.86s)]
*  But who isn't i'm not ashamed of of anything i've done there, you know at all, but i'm saying like who who isn't [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8229.460000000001s)]
*  I think it's important. I think you should be I think you should definitely be ashamed of what you've done wrong and I am [[02:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8235.619999999999s)]
*  But I also think that you should know what you did wrong [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8240.66s)]
*  And be ashamed for the things that are wrong and not ashamed for the things that aren't wrong [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8243.539999999999s)]
*  You shouldn't just be ashamed because of how people see you because I decide to judge exactly I agree [[02:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8246.98s)]
*  And I also look I also agree that we're seeing things [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8251.46s)]
*  Uh that we haven't seen in ways some of it is because we have reach right because we have so much more media [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8254.82s)]
*  Now an ability for things to be seen technologically [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8262.1s)]
*  But we also do have [[02:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8265.86s)]
*  a [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8268.26s)]
*  growing level of acceptance of [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8269.460000000001s)]
*  destructive and negative ideas [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8272.720000000001s)]
*  Look what what bothered me [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8275.94s)]
*  And but my big boogeyman is god forbid there was another 9 11 [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8278.5s)]
*  Would we come together? [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8283.94s)]
*  I want to say yes. I don't know [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8285.7s)]
*  Certainly, I know how president trump would handle it and it would not be the way president bush did [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8288.02s)]
*  Conflicts into this country. I just want to say that meaning [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8292.5s)]
*  Meaning that one of the byproducts of immigration is people bring their ancient resentments with them [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8295.94s)]
*  And that should not be allowed [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8300.42s)]
*  Period like you want to come to our country for the opportunity for the freedom great [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8302.66s)]
*  But you cannot once you arrive use the things that you're mad about in your home country to influence my foreign policy [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8307.460000000001s)]
*  My family's been here a long time. That's not allowed. It's not your country actually [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8313.78s)]
*  You're we're welcoming you but you can't bring your ancient [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8316.58s)]
*  Hatreds with you and and a lot of different groups have and it affects our foreign policy. I really resent it [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8320.5s)]
*  It's my money my children's lives [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8327.22s)]
*  On the line and my country so, you know a normal country doesn't allow that [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8330.18s)]
*  They had a protest of bungaladeshi workers in the uae earlier this year [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8334.34s)]
*  And they weren't mad at the government of uae [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8339.22s)]
*  They were mad at some issue back in bungaladesh and they marched down the street and the government of uae [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8341.14s)]
*  Deported them that night [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8345.46s)]
*  Not because they're mad at them [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8347.14s)]
*  But like we don't import foreign conflicts in our country because it's not these are our problems and yet and yet here's a counterfactual [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8348.019999999999s)]
*  What do we see happening in europe right now that isn't happening here them having huge? [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8354.5s)]
*  Numbers of muslims from different ethnic extracts [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8360.08s)]
*  In that part of the globe coming into societies not assimilating [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8364.339999999998s)]
*  I agree that's certainly what the french are dealing with and what the uk is dealing with to a little bit of a lesser extent [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8368.74s)]
*  in america [[02:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8373.3s)]
*  That hasn't happened. Yes, we're farther away. We'll see but hasn't happened muslims come into this country [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8374.58s)]
*  It's one of two countries on the face of the planet that have more jews than muslims probably won't stay that way [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8380.34s)]
*  But when they come into this country, they assimilate [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8385.46s)]
*  And we don't do what the french allowed which is to have them all living [[02:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8388.42s)]
*  Uh together and separate from the rest of the society america is about assimilating true. I would the only things [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8392.74s)]
*  Having spent a long time in europe. I would say one. I think it's unfair to blame [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8399.86s)]
*  It's like everyone blames the european populations like [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8403.94s)]
*  You know your algerians are killing people with machetes on the street because you're a racist. That's not fair. It's their country [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8406.900000000001s)]
*  They're the indigenous population. This was imposed on them by their leaders. Don't blame them [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8412.1s)]
*  A b europe is just way smaller. It's way smaller [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8416.5s)]
*  And so the united states is so big that i've spent my whole life here. There are a lot of parts of the country [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8420.5s)]
*  I don't know what's going on there [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8425.140000000001s)]
*  And I travel a lot in this country and I go to places i'm like, what is this? [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8426.980000000001s)]
*  It bears no resemblance to what I thought was here totally different go to portland, maine [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8430.74s)]
*  It doesn't look anything like the portland, maine you remember and [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8435.46s)]
*  There's no evidence people are are assimilating at all you go to lewiston, maine [[02:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8439.06s)]
*  They imported all these somalis there 30 years ago. They've never assimilated at all at all in any way [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8442.98s)]
*  Just kind of take it over downtown lewiston. It's it's a slum. It's dangerous [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8448.18s)]
*  And there's no assimilation whatsoever. No english is spoken [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8452.82s)]
*  And so [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8456.9s)]
*  You know, I think the lessons of europe the united states I think did a really good job of assimilating immigrants your grandparents [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8458.1s)]
*  You know when the great southern european wave of immigration came at the turn of the last century and and they really like self-conscious [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8463.300000000001s)]
*  Like all public schools like taught civics and like this is what it's been american learn english [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8468.82s)]
*  Like did your did your parents even speak italian? Oh, yeah, but but but what what did my grandparents want? [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8472.82s)]
*  Be american exactly. No, but that's exactly right. But speak the language be american [[02:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8479.7s)]
*  They were discouraged from speaking italian except in the house because my my grandparents didn't speak english exactly and that I think was the rule [[02:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8483.86s)]
*  and you know, whatever the language was so [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8491.78s)]
*  That's no longer true because we're not when we make any effort [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8495.060000000001s)]
*  To make people american because we can't define what american is [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8498.34s)]
*  And we need to do that now and just require that everyone who lives here buys into the same [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8502.1s)]
*  Some species the same program. I don't think we should be north korea about it, but we need to have a unifying [[02:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8507.380000000001s)]
*  Idea or else we will break apart. Do you believe directionally this administration is going the right way? [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8511.859999999999s)]
*  Well, I think they've identified some things that are really wrong and [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8520.099999999999s)]
*  In the first six weeks have [[02:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8523.859999999999s)]
*  It made way more progress than I ever would have thought of fighting those things [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8525.859999999999s)]
*  so, but I mean we have we have some very very serious problems and [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8529.779999999999s)]
*  Will they are they equal to that if anyone is they are I they've amazed me in the first six weeks [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8534.66s)]
*  but [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8541.619999999999s)]
*  You know, there's a lot coming there could be an economic reset [[02:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8543.22s)]
*  Probably likely will I mean these are cyclical to some extent [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8546.82s)]
*  And and then there's also the technology question. There's the ai question [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8550.66s)]
*  And I just don't understand what you're going to do with 15 million new unskilled workers in a society that doesn't need workers [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8554.42s)]
*  And i'm really worried about that. I don't know who thought of that like on the on the cusp of the ai revolution [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8563.06s)]
*  Let's open the borders to haiti like what? [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8568.019999999999s)]
*  What are you doing? [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8570.9s)]
*  That's like the greatest crime that's ever been committed against this country and I hope i'm wrong man. I'm often wrong [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8572.02s)]
*  So I hope i'm wrong. I really hope i'm wrong here [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8576.82s)]
*  that seems like [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8580.34s)]
*  Suicidal to me. I think it is I think that the biggest question and look I don't have the answer but the biggest question [[02:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8581.78s)]
*  is [[02:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8587.94s)]
*  How to unify how to take your fingers and make them into a fist. Yes. What worried me look what was I got married? [[02:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8589.14s)]
*  Um [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8595.46s)]
*  Two months after 9 11 I got engaged 11 days after 9 11 because of 9 11 [[02:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8597.3s)]
*  Because I realized the preciousness of life and I thought that was going to happen all the time [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8602.58s)]
*  I thought it was the new normal that they were just going to be blowing shit up all the time [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8606.9s)]
*  And my wife made the you know, the one [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8610.74s)]
*  Bad decision that she's made since I've known her which is she agreed to marry me and was it a tough sell? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8614.099999999999s)]
*  Oh, yeah, if it hadn't been 9 11, she would have never said yes [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8620.42s)]
*  She probably leveraged a terror attack to win. She could get out of it now on the basis of impossibility of contract because of duress [[02:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8623.46s)]
*  So when I saw like for me like even like a january 6 to me was [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8629.94s)]
*  We don't all come down on the side of what is right and wrong [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8635.3s)]
*  collectively anymore [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8639.22s)]
*  um, you know that [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8640.74s)]
*  When george floyd happened people going down the streets and protests, they're going to be angry [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8643.3s)]
*  They're going to say angry things. It's not going to be peaceful in terms of speech. Okay [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8647.779999999999s)]
*  Destroying buildings and that's okay taking over cities and that's okay not okay [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8652.58s)]
*  We should have all felt that way. We always had until that point. No fair january 6th [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8657.460000000001s)]
*  the [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8663.060000000001s)]
*  The you don't do that. You don't go busting into the capital. Everybody should have been on the same page instead [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8664.1s)]
*  It was well, what about george floyd the black life matter stuff? [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8669.62s)]
*  That type of discontinuity [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8673.380000000001s)]
*  Is very unsettling to me. We all know what's right and wrong [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8676.18s)]
*  On very gross levels, okay [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8680.42s)]
*  And when you ignore those things for advantage you start getting into a dangerous situation [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8682.980000000001s)]
*  I don't know that we do. I mean one of my core beliefs is that [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8688.18s)]
*  shouldn't kill kids [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8693.300000000001s)]
*  Totally opposed to abortion. I think it's like the most obviously evil thing we've ever done [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8694.82s)]
*  and I [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8699.220000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of really nice people. I like a lot who totally disagree with me [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8700.5s)]
*  And I don't know why they do [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8704.42s)]
*  But they do [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8706.34s)]
*  And that's like a core. I mean abortion is not just like some boutique even i'm not an evangelical by the way [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8707.86s)]
*  For the record, but I just have always thought like what you can't do that. I don't care how we can mean [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8714.5s)]
*  This is a baby [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8719.220000000001s)]
*  You can't fucking kill babies [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8720.5s)]
*  But most people I know in my affluent world totally disagree [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8722.26s)]
*  So I think and that I just would say that's like a core disagreement [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8726.980000000001s)]
*  so [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8731.220000000001s)]
*  I think [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8732.42s)]
*  I think there are a lot of deep disagreements like real disagreements that have [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8733.94s)]
*  You know are pre-existing and maybe haven't surfaced right? But here's the difference and in terms of what it is to be america [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8738.5s)]
*  What is our national religion? Yeah, it is the law [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8745.7s)]
*  The law is our natural religion religion is a set of rules, right? You have faith you have faith [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8751.060000000001s)]
*  I have faith. I choose to have faith can't prove that there's a basis of my faith, but I choose it [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8756.26s)]
*  Religion is a set of rules our set of rules is the law [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8762.42s)]
*  That's what unites you in this country. That's why it's so important [[02:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8765.94s)]
*  That's why politicians love to fuck with it as much as they do because they know it's the essential fabric [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8768.5s)]
*  Is that you have? [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8773.300000000001s)]
*  fairness under law [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8775.300000000001s)]
*  so [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8777.300000000001s)]
*  abortion [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8778.900000000001s)]
*  Reproductive rights, however, you want to term it you can feel however you want to feel about it [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8780.320000000002s)]
*  I can feel however I want to feel about it [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8785.460000000001s)]
*  Then we have the law right now the law is you decide state by state, okay [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8787.539999999999s)]
*  It is the first reversal of a right in our lifetime [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8792.74s)]
*  Where a right had been recognized and then removed? [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8796.98s)]
*  That was very politically destabilizing [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8801.619999999999s)]
*  I thought turned out not to be in the election [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8804.099999999999s)]
*  Turned out wasn't the midterms. I mean, no we had the volstead act [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8806.82s)]
*  No, but this is where there was a right to drink and then you couldn't and then you could no that's a privilege [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8810.82s)]
*  We had a right to run for more than two terms as president [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8816.82s)]
*  That again is not a natural right. It was it was in the constitution. There was no you had a right to run for president [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8820.02s)]
*  but that is [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8826.9s)]
*  That is [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8828.74s)]
*  different [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8830.1s)]
*  Than because it doesn't have an organized screechy unhappy lady. No, no, no how many terms you have as president? [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8831.300000000001s)]
*  Is guaranteed on the constitution you can run for president is not but you can amend the constitution [[02:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8837.86s)]
*  Well, that's what i'm saying the constitution we make all kinds of changes [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8842.34s)]
*  We consider some things rights and then we decide they're not rights. I mean there's no [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8845.94s)]
*  There's no natural law that would support abortion. Of course not. That's insane [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8850.1s)]
*  You can't take no the natural law would be control over your own body. No, the natural law would be a person [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8855.300000000001s)]
*  Has a right to be alive that supersedes your control of your body [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8861.14s)]
*  But when is it a person has rights attached to it? Well, you can well we'll just start with when the child can live outside the womb [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8863.94s)]
*  There's no debate there that that is not the line that was drawn even in roe v wade [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8870.019999999999s)]
*  I'm i'm just saying there are plenty of states that happens a more generous assessment to people who believe in reproductive rights [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8874.9s)]
*  Than the law had been on the roe v wade kids are aborted [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8880.66s)]
*  Every year post viability. It's just a fact and they say well the child, you know, there's lots of reasons for it, but [[02:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8883.939999999999s)]
*  So, I mean late term abortions are almost [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8890.98s)]
*  Not a thing they happen incredibly [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8894.82s)]
*  Is almost not a thing. No, but i'm saying that statistically the idea that we had to focus on late term abortion [[02:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8898.18s)]
*  I don't know was pure politics rape on subway platforms is almost not a thing, but i'm concerned about it [[02:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8903.460000000001s)]
*  I don't want it because it's wrong [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8908.66s)]
*  And anytime a child who can live outside the womb is murdered like i'm upset about it [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8910.9s)]
*  And I don't care how often it happens happens one time if it even could happen. I'm opposed to it [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8915.78s)]
*  It's a baby. It wasn't part of the law [[02:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8919.7s)]
*  Okay, but i'm just saying it happens but the viability standard the goodmocker institute takes the numbers and you can look it up [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8921.7s)]
*  so anyway, i'm just saying like [[02:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8927.060000000001s)]
*  Okay, it's a right no, these are political institutions that respond to the public will or what they think it is [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8930.58s)]
*  But what about human rights? [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8936.58s)]
*  What about natural rights that are bestowed by god that aren't supposed to be infringed on by men? [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8937.7s)]
*  Isn't one of those the control and sanctity of your own body? [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8942.18s)]
*  I don't think that's I mean, i'm not the i'm not the law school graduate here [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8945.380000000001s)]
*  But I i'm not I would they don't teach you about god-given rights in law school because that's our founding document is [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8948.66s)]
*  But that's that's not a secular. That's not a secular understanding [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8955.22s)]
*  It says that in the document the constitution does not mention god the declaration of independence does sure [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8959.14s)]
*  But that's not our operative document the constitution is and our constitution does not mention god [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8964.1s)]
*  Nothing is predicated on god except of separation of church and state [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8968.74s)]
*  We don't we don't identify rights in the bill of rights. How are the rights? [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8972.42s)]
*  Articulated explained as as a function of the collection [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8978.0s)]
*  Especially the bill of rights which you just referred to because they sent it out to the states and the states came back with the recommendations [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8981.359999999999s)]
*  Okay [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8989.46s)]
*  We say they're god-given but the problem with that is you live in a secular society [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8991.22s)]
*  So what if somebody doesn't believe in god do they not have rights? Of course they do [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8994.259999999998s)]
*  Of course they do they're attached by the collective. Yeah. Well the [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=8998.019999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the first amendment says that [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9001.939999999999s)]
*  The government can't have religious tests so um, but I guess that you could just whatever this rabbit hole [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9004.5s)]
*  But I think we can just like stick with the bill of rights and just we could start there [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9009.460000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and say that you know [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9014.02s)]
*  Those are the rights that our government exists to protect right wherever they emanate from and the first one is the freedom of speech [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9016.5s)]
*  and when you see the entire [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9022.34s)]
*  Leadership class of the country opposing [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9025.380000000001s)]
*  The first right enumerated in the bill of rights that you know [[02:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9027.86s)]
*  The whole project is bullshit and the people running it don't believe in it and you set the stage for revolution [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9030.02s)]
*  Which is really scary [[02:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9035.380000000001s)]
*  Here's my problem with it. I am totally with you about [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9036.9s)]
*  Having to tolerate the things that you don't like and you don't want to listen to in a democracy [[02:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9041.380000000001s)]
*  100 market place of ideas 100 [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9046.02s)]
*  And I would even argue that it is better to have more ideas that are offensive because it makes it easier for the better ideas [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9049.62s)]
*  To rise to the top. I honestly believe that i'm very worried about any kind of concerted effort to limit speech 100 [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9057.619999999999s)]
*  Here's what i'm struggling with [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9065.78s)]
*  Our jurisprudence has moved in the opposite [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9069.3s)]
*  Direction as our culture our culture has been getting a little bit more [[02:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9073.46s)]
*  Uh finicky with what it likes people talking about right? That's canceled culture censorious [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9077.78s)]
*  The law has been expanding right when you look back at chaplinsky in the 1920s 1940s [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9083.88s)]
*  Jurisprudence they used to say at the supreme court level [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9089.32s)]
*  You know the first amendment wasn't created for tucker carlson to figure out how to say the meanest shit [[02:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9091.8s)]
*  He can to chris cuomo and be protected from it [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9095.88s)]
*  And then you had fighting words doctrine, which is hey [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9099.08s)]
*  Tucker carlson can't walk up to chris cuomo and say something about his mom and expect not to get a punch in the nose [[02:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9102.28s)]
*  And then they expanded it even more and then he said well you can't [[02:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9107.64s)]
*  Say fire in a crowded theater. Yeah, you probably can under the supreme court law [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9111.08s)]
*  There's a new test of whether it's reasonably [[02:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9115.720000000001s)]
*  Conceived to create violence [[02:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9119.140000000001s)]
*  So they kept expanding the right so the first amendment jurisprudentially from the supreme court has been getting broader and broader [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9122.44s)]
*  And I wonder if it has come with a culture cost [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9128.84s)]
*  And I don't like to look at mike tyson as any kind of philosophical basis [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9132.68s)]
*  But he said once [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9137.240000000002s)]
*  Social media has made people forget that sometimes what comes out of your mouth is going to get you punched in the face [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9140.12s)]
*  That's right [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9144.68s)]
*  And I do wonder these days [[02:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9145.560000000001s)]
*  Maybe it's the angry old man and me coming out, but do you think we've gone too far? [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9147.560000000001s)]
*  In allowing things to be okay to be said not as political thought [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9153.720000000001s)]
*  but as invective as [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9159.480000000001s)]
*  Insults and how people are allowed to treat each other now and if I do anything about it [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9161.78s)]
*  If you do anything about it [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9167.400000000001s)]
*  You're the one in trouble [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9169.4s)]
*  I would say there I would just make two slippery slope. I know but I struggle not slippery at all [[02:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9171.32s)]
*  There are two obvious points to make one is that if you live in a society where you're not allowed to criticize the people [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9175.8s)]
*  In charge you live in a tyranny. Yes as in ukraine agreed [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9180.92s)]
*  Not about ukraine, but I agree with the principle murdered gonzalo leara for criticizing the government [[02:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9185.4s)]
*  So yeah, and we have done that here and i'm i'm opposed to so that's like a super easy test [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9189.48s)]
*  If you are not allowed to criticize the people who have more power than you do [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9193.72s)]
*  You're not living in a free country. I still think it's weird that you look at ukraine and not russia for the immediate example [[02:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9197.4s)]
*  I'm not i'm not funding russia and my tax dollars are funding ukraine [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9201.56s)]
*  So that's kind of why I have a special interest any country that we fund we have a right to look carefully at where our money's going [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9205.16s)]
*  No, no issue with that any country. Okay, so I would say that [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9211.08s)]
*  And the second point is of course, I think the public discourse is completely out of control. I think pornography is disgusting and I think [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9215.24s)]
*  The cruelty that I see all the time [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9222.04s)]
*  Is shocking to me and really sad and I hate it and [[02:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9225.16s)]
*  There's clearly like some deep rage going on inside people. I think I understand where it comes from but i'm totally opposed to it [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9228.52s)]
*  What do you do about it? [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9235.4s)]
*  Well, I all I can say for myself is I try not to add to it [[02:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9237.16s)]
*  I certainly have added to it, you know sometimes and i'm sorry about that. I really try not to now [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9240.12s)]
*  Probably should start a little earlier. But um, but I I still do but anyway, I I don't know what you do [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9246.68s)]
*  I don't know what to do just try and you know model [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9252.119999999999s)]
*  reasonable decent last thing i'll say [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9254.74s)]
*  I think it's the most important thing when you're talking to another person to remember that it's a person you're talking to [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9258.119999999999s)]
*  I saw something happen people are gonna get angry at me about this. But by the way, um, [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9264.519999999999s)]
*  I think that [[02:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9269.48s)]
*  uh [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9270.759999999998s)]
*  As much as this is remarkable for people. I don't care about why people are interested in you and I talking to each other [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9271.88s)]
*  I know [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9278.279999999999s)]
*  It's part of the solution and it doesn't matter people can listen to this and think everything that we both just said is completely a waste [[02:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9279.8s)]
*  Of the uh time that they spent watching it. I'm okay with that [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9286.599999999999s)]
*  I still know [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9290.439999999999s)]
*  That it's part of it because one when we were working at two different places [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9291.72s)]
*  We would have never been allowed to do this. Yes, and part of being in those places would be adversarial with each other [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9294.599999999999s)]
*  And you were much better at that than I was by the way, but i'm truly an asshole deep down [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9300.599999999999s)]
*  Uh, it's not that deep but what i'm saying is I know that we're not supposed to be do this and we're some of the [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9306.279999999999s)]
*  Only ones who do yes, um, and I appreciate you and respect you for that [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9312.52s)]
*  I'm hanging out at a place that I love to go to during the summertime [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9318.039999999999s)]
*  And there are maga hats all over the place [[02:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9321.4s)]
*  a guy in the maga hat [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9324.6s)]
*  is a little drunk little out of it and gets into it with somebody who does not have a maga hat on [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9326.76s)]
*  And eventually the guy without the maga hat on smacks the maga hat off the guy's head [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9333.48s)]
*  The guy gets angry punches the guy who smacked it off his head [[02:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9340.04s)]
*  um [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9344.68s)]
*  Cops come [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9346.44s)]
*  arrest [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9348.12s)]
*  The maga hat guy because he punched the other guy in the face and there are all these other people there [[02:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9349.24s)]
*  and [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9354.52s)]
*  I was going to talk about it on the show [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9355.880000000001s)]
*  And didn't because I realized that what I was going to say was not embracing of the law [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9359.08s)]
*  But to me felt like what would have been right in the situation [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9365.880000000001s)]
*  and [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9370.6s)]
*  I have never really figured this out. I could read a hundred I could give you a hundred different arguments of what's right and what's wrong [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9371.880000000001s)]
*  but how I feel [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9378.76s)]
*  is [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9381.32s)]
*  When the guy smacked the hat off the head of the other guy [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9383.0s)]
*  It seemed to me that it was not more wrong than the guy punching him [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9388.52s)]
*  You know, it didn't seem like he had high ground [[02:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9395.0s)]
*  You smack the hat off the guy's head before that it had been this and there was plenty ugliness going back and forth [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9397.24s)]
*  He then smacks the hat off the guy punches. I mean he didn't hit him with a two by four [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9403.480000000001s)]
*  But he punched him. He opened him up. He was bleeding [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9407.640000000001s)]
*  and [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9411.0s)]
*  Everyone I would talk to about it would say well, come on chris. I mean you can't do that [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9412.68s)]
*  Why? [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9416.919999999998s)]
*  Because it's the law. Okay. Why is it the law because we want to enforce civilization, but we're not that civilized [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9418.359999999999s)]
*  I get it. We give ourselves too much credit for civility, especially in america everything we embrace [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9424.839999999998s)]
*  Is violent and aggressive [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9431.24s)]
*  Why does everybody like the rock because he's a great actor? No, it's that symbology of what he represents as a male [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9433.08s)]
*  and [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9440.519999999999s)]
*  I I know that it's wrong, but I feel like [[02:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9441.96s)]
*  You can't be punching everybody in the face that you disagree with I know of course [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9445.56s)]
*  But it's now like [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9450.2s)]
*  We empower people to be their absolute [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9452.04s)]
*  Worst all the time and they gain advantage of it people say things. They're not just criticizing you [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9455.56s)]
*  They don't just criticize. Oh, I know they say [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9462.52s)]
*  horrible things about people their families whatever it is [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9465.48s)]
*  And I don't know how that's making us any better [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9470.919999999998s)]
*  Is that just what we have to tolerate to be in a democracy or have we fucked it up? [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9473.4s)]
*  I [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9479.24s)]
*  It's pretty clear, I mean, I of course I know exactly what you're saying and I agree with you and I think that um [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9481.64s)]
*  None of that is an excuse for the people in power to shut down criticism of themselves as has happened in europe and australia [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9487.16s)]
*  Hope it doesn't happen here on the other hand [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9492.839999999998s)]
*  I do think you know if you don't think of other people as human [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9495.32s)]
*  You can there's no limit to what you can do to them and I do think that's like the key thing to remember is these are people [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9498.6s)]
*  they have identical value in the eyes of god that you do and [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9504.28s)]
*  You should always remember that no matter how pissed you are at them and no you can't kill them [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9508.44s)]
*  No, no, no, of course, but i'm saying that [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9512.04s)]
*  I don't know man. I just feel like we're getting less civilized even though the law is expanding [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9514.52s)]
*  Can I say one last thing? Go ahead [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9519.400000000001s)]
*  Um, yeah, thank the internet for that. Uh [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9521.880000000001s)]
*  I am [[02:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9525.240000000002s)]
*  thrilled [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9527.16s)]
*  That you're enjoying yourself [[02:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9528.6s)]
*  outside of [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9530.76s)]
*  The confines of the business we were both in and even if I disagree with you on certain things [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9532.119999999999s)]
*  I just think it's it's it's inspirational to see a free man. So [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9535.64s)]
*  I appreciate you. I like coming down to see you and I think that the point is as simple as that tucker [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9539.88s)]
*  We're not going to agree on everything. Okay [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9546.36s)]
*  But but I know you do because there's not one sicilian man in america doesn't love trump [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9549.24s)]
*  There's not one and I don't believe you're that man [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZTmlsfH0JA&t=9552.84s)]
